" close      Video The Orthodox Jewish community responds to the New York Times The umbrella Orthodox Jewish group, Agudath Israel, fired back at the New York Times with a billboard outside their headquarters. NEW YORK CITY – Following several months of coverage by The New York Times, an Orthodox Jewish umbrella group fired back with a public campaign to counter what it deemed a demonizing ""crusade"" against Orthodox Jews. ""We resent that the Times are engaged in what appears to be a crusade,"" said Rabbi David Zwiebel, the executive vice president of Agudath Israel — an organization founded in 1922 that represents various Orthodox Jewish communities. ""A crusade to get people to consider Hasidic Jews in a negative light.""Beginning in September, the Times started to publish a series of investigative stories about Orthodox boys schools, also known as yeshivas, particularly singling out the Hasidic community — a smaller group that falls under the Orthodox Jewish umbrella. The articles reported, among other findings, that some yeshivas faced dismal scores on standardized tests and provided minimal secular education while receiving significant public funding.THE ORTHODOX JEWISH COMMUNITY RESPONDS TO THE NEW YORK TIMES. WATCH: VideoWATCH MORE FOX NEWS DIGITAL ORIGINALS HERE""There does appear to be a concerted effort that is currently taking place and has been taking place over the last number of months to find various aspects of Orthodox Jewish communal life — education, social activities and others — to portray it in a way that is very negative,"" Zwiebel told Fox News. ""We are concerned that it is not only troubling, but even dangerous to a certain extent.""Agudath Israel leaders said the Times' coverage didn't give the Orthodox community a sufficient chance to showcase the benefits of a yeshiva education and instead included one quote from the organization about graduates' successful career paths. The leaders also said the coverage generalized overall yeshiva education by sharing experiences from individual schools while avoiding mentioning positive attributes of the community.They said the Times negatively portrayed the community at a time when antisemitism is on the rise — the number of antisemitic hate crimes doubled from 2020 to 2022 and are more frequent than hate crimes on all other minority groups in the city according to the New York Police Department.

""When The New York Times spends several months publishing article after article relentlessly portraying Hasidic Jews in a negative light, it just adds more poison to the atmosphere.""""When there is more poison in the atmosphere, it's dangerous,"" he continued.The Times did not respond to Fox News' request for comment.Zwiebel said that after the Times published several articles, various Jewish groups met with the paper's editorial leadership to discuss concerns about the ""lack of balance"" in the coverage.""The Times would probably say that meeting was helpful and maybe led to a little bit more balance in subsequent articles but I haven’t seen it,"" said Zwiebel, who was present at the meeting.Agudath Israel in January launched its KnowUs.org campaign, which includes billboards posted around Manhattan and a website with information disputing the Times' reporting about various Orthodox and Hasidic Jewish schools.Moshe Krakowski, a Yeshiva University professor who studies American Orthodox education and culture, told Fox News the community felt it needed to speak out.""They feel demonized, justifiably, and would like people to get another side of the story since nobody else is actually articulating the other side of the story,"" Karkowski said.Zwiebel, Krakowski and several Orthodox Jews told Fox News it's unusual for a group like Agudath Israel to launch a public relations campaign.""We are an insular community,"" Zwiebel said. ""We have no reason to draw attention to ourselves as a general principle.""""And then these articles start to appear and then the person out there on the street who is wondering what Orthodox Jews are like — 'why do they dress so funny and they speak funny and have all these strange weird habits, what's with them?' — and then these articles appear that distort the reality of who we are,"" Zwiebel continued.WITH ANTISEMITISM ON THE RISE, AMERICAN JEWISH GROUPS AIM TO TAKE A STAND AGAINST THREATS  A KnowUs.org billboard outside the New York Times' video reads: ""Attacks on Orthodox Jews have more than doubled recently. Dear New York Times, words do break bones. Please stop attacking our community."" (Photo by Fox News Digital)The Times' investigation noted that its journalists interviewed hundreds of people and analyzed millions of rows of data over the course of a year. Among other details, the articles reported that yeshiva students overwhelmingly fail standardized tests; that graduates ""are unprepared to navigate the outside world; and that some ""end up addicted to drugs and alcohol"" as a consequence of the education provided.Both Krakowski and Zwiebel told Fox News that much of the Times' reporting relied on anecdotal evidence and interviews with disgruntled former members of the community. Krakowski also criticized the Times for not reaching out to him in their research since, according to him, he's the leading academic in the country specializing in Hasidic Jewish school systems.""They visited a school where I know the kids in that school can read or write. And if they visited that school, they would’ve seen that the kids can read and write, but they felt like that would not match what they were trying to present,"" Krakowski said. ""So instead they gave the school’s test scores and said ‘look these kids are illiterate.’""One of Agudath Israel's billboards was intentionally placed next to the Times' headquarters on Eighth Avenue.""One of the sites that was intriguing to us was a site very, very close to The New York Times building,"" Zwiebel said. ""We didn’t just want commuters stuck in traffic to know that we were concerned about the negative image that was being portrayed in the Times, but we wanted the Times to know that we were concerned.""Other billboards were located outside the Lincoln Tunnel and near Times Square.""Attacks on Orthodox Jews have more than doubled recently,"" the bright blue billboards read.

Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., from the House Intelligence Committee, but when it comes to McCarthy's push to oust Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., from the House Foreign Affairs Committee he remains unsure.Omar has been criticized for anti-Israel remarks that incorporated antisemitic tropes. In a Newsmax appearance Monday evening, Gaetz said he did not view this as requiring removal from a committee the same way he did with Schiff and Swalwell.""I view the Schiff and Swalwell matter somewhat differently than I view the Ilhan Omar matter. Ilhan Omar didn’t lie about our intelligence agencies, she didn’t say that Trump was a Russian agent based on information from a particular committee that was just totally bogus,"" Gaetz said. ""The reason I think a lot of Republicans want to kick Ilhan Omar off of the Foreign Affairs Committee is because they don’t like what she has to say.""Omar's statements include a 2012 tweet in which she said, ""Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel,"" and another from 2019 that said, ""It’s all about the Benjamins baby,"" in reference to why lawmakers supported Israel.SCHIFF, SWALWELL, OMAR RESPOND AFTER SPEAKER MCCARTHY KEEPS THEM OFF COMMITTEE: ‘POLITICAL VENGEANCE’  Rep.

The exact wording of the 2011 article was that the standing ovation the prime minister got in Congress was ""bought and paid for by the Israel lobby"" — a statement for which he received significant backlash.Friedman's remarks seem to echo those of Rep.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.Israel’s foreign minister on Thursday made the first public visit to Ukraine by a senior Israeli official since Russia’s invasion last year, pledging financial aid to the war-battered country but giving no indication that Israel is ready to provide weapons to Ukraine.At a joint press conference with his Ukrainian counterpart, Foreign Minister Eli Cohen said Israel would provide a $200 million loan for construction of a health-care facility. He also reiterated an Israeli offer to help Ukraine develop a ""smart early-warning"" air raid system.But he gave no specifics on when that system might be delivered, made no mention of Russia and did not appear to respond to Ukrainian appeals for Israel to provide offensive weaponry.""Israel, as stated in the past, stands firmly in solidarity with the people of Ukraine and remains committed to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine,"" Cohen said.The visit came just before the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion and as Western nations seek to increase aid to the country.Since the outbreak of the war, Israel has walked a tightrope between assisting Ukraine and avoiding friction with Russia, with which it has strategic regional interests. Unlike other western countries, Israel has not imposed sanctions on Russia or Russian officials or provided Ukraine with weapons.ISRAELI OFFICIALS DOUBLE DOWN ON SETTLEMENT CONSTRUCTION, REBUKE US CRITICISMIt has provided humanitarian support to Ukraine, including a field hospital, and pledged to provide the aerial-warning system.

Shortly after taking office, he spoke to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.Israel maintains good working relations with both warring countries, and has large populations of Russian and Ukrainian immigrants. Israel also relies on security coordination with Russia over neighboring Syria, where Israel has carried out hundreds of airstrikes against Iranian military positions in the past decade. Russian warplanes also operate in support of Syrian President Bashar Assad, and Russia and Israel maintain communication to avoid conflict.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAs other Western nations step up assistance to Ukraine, pressure has built on Israel to share some of its sophisticated military means with Ukraine, including from the U.S.Secretary of State Antony Blinken said following a meeting with Netanyahu in Jerusalem last month that he had emphasized ""the importance of providing support for all of Ukraine’s needs – humanitarian, economic, and security.""Yossi Shain, a former member of the Knesset’s foreign affairs and defense committee, said Israel’s ultranationalist government — which has butted heads with the Biden administration on the issue of West Bank settlements — may try to gain Washington’s favor by providing defensive capabilities to Ukraine, while ""not crossing certain lines that will endanger its lesser involvement because of the threats of Russia"" in neighboring Syria.Last year, Israel’s former prime minister, Naftali Bennett, attempted briefly to mediate between the sides, flying to Moscow shortly after Russia’s invasion and meeting with President Vladimir Putin.

Ilhan Omar from the Foreign Affairs Committee in a party-line vote.SEAN HANNITY: Here are the facts. Congresswoman Omar was removed from the Foreign Affairs Committee because of her own terrible behavior. Her reckless rhetoric, her irresponsible rhetoric, anti-Semitic rhetoric. For example, here's what she tweeted out about our top ally, Israel. ‘Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel.’ Omar also used Jewish tropes about money, pushed conspiracy theories about Jewish influence over the US government. And according to Omar, 'It's all about the Benjamins, baby.' And then she also palled around with the notorious, well, bigot of Israel. That's Linda Sarsour that's pictured right there. And Omar even compared the US to Al-Qaeda and suggested that many terror groups really aren't that bad and no different from the US Army. OCASIO-CORTEZ EXPLODES OVER VOTE TO BOOT OMAR, SLAPS NOTEBOOK AGAINST PODIUM: ‘TARGETING WOMEN OF COLOR’…And by the way. Here she is laughing and smirking while one of her colleagues spoke about American troops being killed in Iraq. And who can ever forget when she described 9/11 as a time, ‘Some people did something.’ 2,977 people died that day. Our fellow Americans, the worst attack on American soil and people still dying from its aftermath. Omar's conduct is so reprehensible that her own Democratic colleagues once introduced a resolution, they condemned her remarks. She was also banned from the country of Israel, rightly so.

The options were: Zionists and Jewish immigrants; the government of Jordan; Palestinian nationalists; or the citizens of Lebanon.""It is simply beyond comprehension that anyone at the New York State Education Department would approve a question on a statewide exam that blatantly promotes hateful anti-Jewish and anti-Israel rhetoric which only fan the flames of antisemitism in our schools,"" the letter says.

The prisoners added that they will respond ""with a war of liberation.""ISRAELI OFFICIALS DOUBLE DOWN ON SETTLEMENT CONSTRUCTION, REBUKE US CRITICISM  Israel's new national security minister is clamping down on the rights of terrorists in prisons.

He also ordered the Israel Prison Service (IPS) to reduce shower time to four minutes and restrict usage of running water to one hour for each prisoner wing.TPS reported that Palestinian prisoners were discovered ""to be deliberately wasting thousands of liters of water by letting showers and faucet taps run for hours at a time."" In the Palestinian enclave of the Gaza Strip, which is ruled by the U.S. and EU-designated terrorist organization Hamas, protesters displayed placards stating, ""Ben-Gvir, go to hell.""A former senior IPS commander described the independence enjoyed by the prisoners to TPS. ""Conditions given to them in the wings – there are 10-15 cells around a courtyard, and a room assigned to be a supermarket. They have a supermarket. Fresh fruit, huge apples, metal cans … meat, fresh breads, whole trucks of bread every day,"" the source said. ""Illusory conditions it’s unbelievable.

This is absolutely absurd.""Yishai Fleisher, an advisor to Ben-Gvir, told TPS that ""Terrorists who murder and maim for jihadist and Israel-hating reasons should not expect a fun and rewarding life filled with fresh pitas, entertainment, and university courses waiting for them.

" close      Video Holocaust Remembrance Day: 'Book of Names' on display at UN Decades-long project names 4.8 million victims to be honored. Virginia Democrats in the state Senate killed two measures supported by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin aimed at combatting antisemitism just two days before Holocaust Remembrance Day last week.Senate bill 1252 would've had Virginia recognize a commonly used ""working definition of antisemitism"" adopted in 2016 by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA), an intergovernmental organization that unites governments (including the U.S.) and experts to combat antisemitism and promote Holocaust remembrance.Six Republicans and one Democrat — Senate Majority Leader Dick Saslaw, who's Jewish – voted for the bill in committee. However, seven Democrats, led by Senate President Pro tempore Louise Lucas, voted against it and an eighth, state Sen. Jennifer McClellan, abstained from the vote, killing the measure before it could get to the floor. McClellan is currently running for Congress in a special election in Virginia's 4th Congressional District to succeed the late Rep.

(Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images)WITH ANTISEMITISM ON THE RISE, AMERICAN JEWISH GROUPS AIM TO TAKE A STAND AGAINST THREATSAs of December, a total of 1,116 global entities — from countries to companies — have adopted and endorsed IHRA's non-legally binding working definition of antisemitism, according to the Combat Antisemitism Movement. In the U.S., this includes 30 states and 56 cities and counties. The State and Education departments did the same under the Trump administration.Even though Virginia's legislature hasn't adopted the definition, Youngkin issued an executive order recognizing it last year.According to the definition, antisemitism ""is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.""IHRA provides 11 specific, contemporary examples of antisemitism in public life, the media, schools, the workplace, and in the religious sphere. Beyond classic antisemitic behavior associated with the likes of the medieval period and Nazi Germany, the examples include denial of the Holocaust and newer forms of antisemitism targeting Israel — such as demonizing the Jewish state, denying its right to exist, and holding it to standards not expected of any other democratic state.Experts have argued the definition is important for a range of practical uses such as adjudicating legal cases, monitoring bigotry on campuses, and training law enforcement.Critics have argued the newer examples of antisemitism cited in the definition don't allow for what they describe as legitimate criticism of Israel and its policies. It's unclear whether this is why some Virginia state senators didn't support the bill. Fox News Digital reached out to McClellan and Sen. Jennifer Boysko, who opposed the measure, for comment, but they did not immediately respond.  State Sen.

" close      Video  Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is back in power Fox News correspondent Trey Yingst has the latest on the prime minister's sixth term on 'Special Report.'JERUSALEM, Israel — In what was considered to be one of the largest protests in Israel's history more than 80,000 people demonstrated against judicial reforms put forward by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government in Jerusalem on Monday. Other protests where also held across the country.The demonstrators, marched and gathered outside the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, held flags and chanted ""democracy"" and ""no to dictatorship"" as Netanyahu's government formally launched a controversial plan to overhaul the country's judicial system.According to the suggested plan, which was introduced mid-January, the ruling coalition will have control over the appointment of judges, including high court justices, and allow the Knesset to re-legislate laws the court annuls with a majority of a simple majority of 61 of the 120 Knesset members. The government will also be able to appoint the president and vice president of the supreme court neither of whom needed to have previously served on the court and potentially not even served as a lower court judge. Justice Minister Yariv Levin has argued that the hight court has surpassed its authority in the last two decades and severely interfered with the ability of elected coalitions and ministers to enact government policies.  Some 80,000 Israelis gathered to protest against judicial reforms pushed by the government of Benjamin Netanyahu.

Isaiah was the prophet who foresaw the destruction of the Second Temple, and Shraga warned of the destruction of the third temple; the state of Israel.He warned that, ""Night and day, in the constitution, law and justice committee, he is moving the anti-democratic legislation forward, the laws that will transform Israel overnight from a liberal democracy into a fascist dictatorship.""On Sunday, President Isaac Herzog appealed to Netanyahu and his coalition allies to suspend the legislation and open a dialogue with the opposition in a special televised address to the nation. Netanyahu has not responded to the appeal.Herzog emphasized the importance of reaching a broad compromise and presented his five-point plan for Israel's balance of powers.    Israelis wave national flags during protest against plans by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's new government to overhaul the judicial system, outside the Knesset, Israel's parliament, in Jerusalem, Monday, Feb. 13, 2023.

""Both sides must understand that if only one side wins – no matter which side it is – we will all lose.

Stop deliberately deteriorating the country into anarchy. Take care of yourselves, and show responsibility and leadership. Most Israeli citizens do not want anarchy. They want a substantive discussion, and in the end, they want unity,"" he said.Despite Herzog's plea the Knesset's constitution, law, and justice Committee, headed by MK Simcha Rothman, approved the second bill that would prevent the Supreme Court from overruling legislation amending one of Israel's semi-constitutional basic laws – effectively restricting the court's power of judicial review on core issues.The vote now sends the legislation to the entire parliament for a series of votes. The step caused chaos in the committee, as opposition members who objected to the move shouted at Rothman 'shame' and were removed from the meeting.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.Two ultranationalist Israeli Cabinet ministers on Tuesday defiantly dismissed a growing chorus of global condemnation of new Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank, instead promising to double down and legalize dozens of wildcat outposts in the occupied territory.Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir reaffirmed their commitment to expand Israeli authority in the lands that the Palestinians seek for a future state. Their comments came after the United States expressed opposition to the move and as four European countries added their criticism.Smotrich, a religious settler, said he and his allies in the government — the most right-wing in Israel's history — remain ""committed to removing completely the restrictions on building in Judea and Samaria,"" referring to the West Bank by its biblical names.BIDEN ADMIN CRITICIZES REPORTED ISRAELI SETTLEMENT EXPANSION IN WEST BANK""Disagreements are allowed, even between friends,"" he added.Ben-Gvir, who also lives in a Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank, urged the U.S. and Europe to ""stop being worried.""""The Land of Israel belongs to the people of Israel,"" he said emphatically. ""Nine settlements is nice. But it’s still not enough. We want many more.""  Two Israeli Cabinet members issued a rebuttal to American criticism of settlement construction in the West Bank.

Despite years of accumulated frustration and escalating rhetoric over Israel's fast-expanding settlements that threaten the realization of the two-state solution that has been a goal of the peace process for years, the U.S. and European Union have avoided taking serious action.ISRAELI PROTESTERS TAKE TO STREETS TO BLAST NETANYAHU 'JUDICIAL REFORMS' AS PM CALLS FOR UNITYIsrael's new government could nonetheless test the country's closest ties. In a contentious coalition deal, Netanyahu promised Smotrich authority over the defense body responsible for planning for both settlements and Palestinian construction in parts of the West Bank where Israel maintains civilian control.Once he receives those powers, Smotrich has vowed to ""normalize"" life for more than 500,000 Israeli settlers in the West Bank, erasing the differences between living in a settlement and within Israel’s internationally recognized border and effectively annexing West Bank territory. Such a move would draw widespread backlash.Israel captured the West Bank, along with east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, in the 1967 Mideast war.

But the anger and fears expressed by those who bravely share their stories are not directed toward their neighbor, Israel. Rather, their criticisms and despair are aimed at their autocratic rulers: Hamas. ""Your own thoughts are taken away from you when you walk down the street, the walls are covered in pictures, slogans and stories of the Hamas leadership and you feel like you’re in a war zone. Is this a city or a military barracks?"" asks one man, who the video calls ""Iyad.""""Gaza is a city. Yet they’ve penetrated it down to the walls, the billboards, even the odor,"" he continues.

When Ahmed decided to document the injuries and uploaded a video to the internet, he was forced into hiding for three days before the Hamas authorities caught and jailed him. ""I’m not trying to make you think I’m a hero,"" he says in his testimony. ""I’m just one of the thousands of people who have dealt with similar situations and worse."" ""When unpleasant videos come out, like the one of hundreds of Gazans celebrating the carnage in Jerusalem last week, they form the impression that Gazans are squarely behind Hamas and that’s exactly what Hamas wants,"" Joseph Braude, founder and president of the Center for Peace Communications, told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""Hamas claims that the people are wrapped around the resistance, that is their claim to legitimacy, but the reality is that the hundreds who turn out for such events are not a cross-section of the millions who stay home,"" he said. HAMAS’ CYBER TERROR IS A TEST CASE FOR OTHER NON-STATE PLAYERS, REPORT SAYSA designated terrorist organization, according to the U.S., EU and Israel, Hamas has maintained an iron-clad grip on Gaza since violently taking over the territory in 2007, after Israel unilaterally withdrew in 2005.

(Reuters/Ibraheem Abu Mustafa) Braude said the goal of the project was not only to ""help Gazans break the blockade"" imposed by Hamas but also to spark a new conversation on the situation worldwide. Since its launch two weeks ago, the Whispers In Gaza series, which was featured by an array of independent media outlets and is available in six languages – Arabic, English, French, Spanish, Portuguese and Persian – has garnered some three million views, with the largest audiences being in the Arab world and North America.In Gaza, Hamas reportedly reacted angrily to the videos sending bot armies to bring down the organization’s distribution platforms and doctoring some of the clips with their own voiceovers. In one of the altered versions, Braude said, the testimony of a Palestinian mother describing anxiety over sending her children to a Hamas-run school was changed to the voice of a mother expressing pride at her child joining the resistance. Monitoring broader reaction to the videos across social media, Braude said, ""we’ve seen the beginnings of what we’d like to achieve, which, in a nutshell, is to start a new conversation about what’s happening in Gaza – a conversation that is wider and more thorough than the polemics which bubble up whenever there’s a war."" ""We interviewed dozens of people inside Gaza on the condition that we would not show their faces, and we would alter their voices and we brought a team of very creative animators, musicians, artists, to turn their voices into, I think, quite beautiful videos that in some ways, are more memorable in the way that they depict these people’s lives artistically,"" he explained. DEADLY GAZA STRIP HOUSE FIRE KILLS 21  An applicant is measured at a Hamas recruitment center in Gaza City on June 3, 2013.

Gazans don’t love war, the wars that happen in Gaza are waged by the Hamas government for political aims that serve them alone."" ""We don’t want war, we want a decent life, our mental and physical health is at risk due to a situation we did not chose,"" she continues. ""A faction is fighting in the name of the Palestinian people but not all Palestinians agree with it. My struggle is to communicate with Palestinians and Israelis and make them understand that I am a human being here in Gaza, not a beast or a terrorist, or a lover of weapons because in the end, weapons won’t get us anywhere."" Avi Melamed, a former Israeli intelligence official and founder of Inside the Middle East, an educational program, told Fox, ""these videos have the potential to make an impact but only if they manage to change the narrative [about Gaza] in the West and start a new process where Western circles finally hold Hamas accountable.""

The military said the raid was meant to apprehend a militant cell that staged a botched shooting attack on a restaurant in a Jewish settlement in the West Bank.The violence extends one of the deadliest periods in years in the West Bank and comes during the first weeks of Israel’s new government, its most right-wing ever, which has promised to take a tough stance against the Palestinians.The Israeli military said it was operating in the Aqabat Jabr refugee camp to apprehend the suspects behind a failed shooting attack last month at a West Bank restaurant, where attackers allegedly were thwarted by a weapon malfunction.

Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said the violence would be met with a response.""Our people and their resistance will not delay in responding to this crime,"" he said.The raid comes days after an earlier incursion in the Aqabat Jabr camp, which is near the Palestinian city of Jericho, a desert oasis in an area of the West Bank that rarely sees such unrest, where troops were also searching for the suspects.Since the shooting at the nearby settlement, the Israeli military has blocked access to several roads into Jericho — a closure that has placed the city under a semi-blockade, disrupting business and creating hourslong bottlenecks at checkpoints that affected even Palestinian security forces, footage showed.Monday’s violence comes days after an Israeli military raid on the Jenin refugee camp killed 10 Palestinians, mostly militants but also a 61-year-old woman.

Settler leaders predicted even faster population growth under Israel's new ultranationalist government.The report, by WestBankJewishPopulationStats.com and based on official figures, showed the settler population grew to 502,991 as of Jan. 1, rising more than 2.5% in 12 months and nearly 16% over the last five years.""We’ve reached a huge hallmark,"" said Baruch Gordon, the director of the group and a resident of the Beit El settlement. ""We’re here to stay.""The milestone comes as Israel’s new government, made up of ultranationalist parties who oppose Palestinian statehood, has placed expanding settlements at the top of its priority list. Already the government has pledged to legalize wildcat outposts that have long enjoyed tacit government support and to ramp up approval and construction of settler homes around the West Bank.""I think that in the coming years of this government there will be more building than there has been in the last 20 years of governments,"" Gordon said.Settlements have flourished under every Israeli government, including at the height of the peace process in the 1990s. Even Israel's short-lived previous government, which included parties supporting Palestinian statehood along with those opposing it, continued to build settlements.PALESTINIANS IN UPROAR AFTER ISRAELI ARMY KILL MILITANTS, ELDERLY WOMAN IN WEST BANKThe report also comes as a new spasm of violence is shaking the region and days after a visit by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who pledged support for an independent Palestinian state. The settler population has continued to grow under the Biden administration, despite renewed American appeals to rein in construction following years of President Donald Trump's hands-off approach.The settler population report does not include annexed east Jerusalem, home to more than 200,000 settlers. The West Bank and east Jerusalem are together home to some 3 million Palestinians.Israel captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians seek those territories for an independent state.Although Israel withdrew troops and several thousand settlers from Gaza in 2005, it has charged ahead with settlement building in the West Bank and east Jerusalem. Dozens of settlements dot the territory, some as small as a few mobile homes and others sprawling cities, with malls and public transport of their own.

There is no legitimacy for settlements or the presence of settlers in the Palestinian territories,"" said Nabil Abu Rudeineh, a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. ""The increase in the number of settlers is the result of Israeli government policies that do not believe in the two-state solution,"" which would create an independent Palestinian state next to Israel.2 PALESTINIANS KILLED IN SEPARATE VIOLENT CONFRONTATIONS WITH ISRAELIS IN THE WEST BANKIsrael claims the West Bank is disputed territory, rather than occupied, saying that terminology denies the Jewish people's historical presence in the land. It argues that the fate of settlements should be part of negotiations to bring about an end to the conflict.Peace efforts have been moribund for nearly 15 years, while Israel continued to establish facts on the ground with more settlement construction and a Palestinian political rivalry complicated peacemaking.The settlers and their many supporters in government view the West Bank as the biblical and historical heartland of the Jewish people and are opposed to any partition.Palestinians and Israelis in the West Bank live under a two-tiered legal system that grants settlers special status and applies much of Israeli law to them including the right to vote in Israeli elections and the ability to access certain public services. Palestinians live under Israeli military rule and they do not enjoy the legal rights and protections afforded to settlers.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe open-ended military occupation has led three well-known human rights groups to conclude that Israel is committing the international crime of apartheid by systematically denying Palestinians equal rights.

" close      Video Fox News Flash top headlines for January 24 Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a surprise trip to Jordan on Tuesday to meet with King Abdullah II for the first time in over four years, seeking to shore up ties that have strained since he took office at the helm of Israel's most right-wing government in history.The rare meeting between the leaders, who have long had a rocky relationship, comes as tensions grow over Israel’s new ultranationalist government, which took office late last year. The talks centered around the status of a contested holy site in the Old City of Jerusalem sacred to both Jews and Muslims, an emotional issue at the heart of the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, Jordan's official statement indicated.Jordan's royal court said the king urged Israel to respect the status quo at the sacred compound, which Muslims call the Noble Sanctuary and Jews call the Temple Mount. The compound — the third-holiest site in Islam — sits on a sprawling plateau also home to the iconic golden Dome of the Rock.ISRAEL, JORDAN SIGN DECLARATION OF INTENT AT UN CLIMATE CONFERENCE TO CONSERVE, PROTECT JORDAN RIVERUnder an arrangement that has prevailed for decades under Jordan's custodianship, Jews and non-Muslims are permitted visits during certain hours but may not pray there. But Jewish religious nationalists, including members of Israel's new governing coalition, have increasingly visited the site and demanded equal prayer rights for Jews there, infuriating the Palestinians and Muslims around the world.In Tuesday's meeting, King Abdullah II also pushed Israel to ""stop its acts of violence"" that are undermining hopes for an eventual peaceful settlement to the decadeslong Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the Jordanian government added, reaffirming its support for a two-state solution. Israel's new coalition has vowed to expand Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and even annex the territory, making a future independent Palestinian state unviable.

Netanyahu made a surprise trip to Jordan to meet with King Abdullah II on Jan 24, 2023. (Abir Sultan/Pool Photo via AP)Netanyahu’s office said he discussed ""regional issues"" and security and economic cooperation with Jordan, a key regional ally. Jordan’s 1994 treaty normalizing ties with Israel produced a chilly-at-best peace between the former enemies.The Jordanian government has already summoned the Israeli ambassador to Amman twice in the last month since Israel's new government took office — both times after an incident at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound. Netanyahu has repeatedly offered assurances that there has been no change in the status quo at the site.ISRAEL URGES CITIZENS TO 'DOWNPLAY' THEIR ISRAELI IDENTITY AT QATAR WORLD CUP FOR THEIR OWN 'SECURITY'Earlier this month, Israel’s new hard-line minister of national security, Itamar Ben-Gvir, made a provocative visit to the site, drawing condemnations from Jordan and across the Arab world. Jordan also protested to Israel after Israeli police briefly blocked the Jordanian ambassador from entering the Al-Aqsa Mosque, decrying the move as an affront to Jordan's role as custodian.The compound is administered by Jordanian religious authorities as part of an unofficial agreement after Israel captured east Jerusalem, along with the West Bank and Gaza, in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel is in charge of security at the site. Because of Jordan’s special role and the site’s importance to Muslims around the world, whatever happens at the site has regional implications.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe site emerged as a major flashpoint between Israel and the Muslim world in 2017, when Israel placed metal detectors, cameras and other security measures at entrances to the compound in response to a deadly Palestinian attack there. After days of some of the worst Israeli-Palestinian clashes in years, Jordan helped resolve the crisis.Over the years, the neighbors have maintained a crucial security alliance, buttressing Jordan’s position as a partner of the West in one of the world’s most volatile regions.

Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., from the Foreign Affairs Committee and called for a new ""code of conduct"" to be added to the House rules. McCarthy said he spoke with Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and asked that Jeffries select a number of Democrats to work with Republican lawmakers to develop a code of conduct for the House. ""I think what we should do is put into the rules that there is a code of conduct here, but I don't know the definition, exactly what all that's going to mean.

" close      Video Brit Hume: I have doubts whether Biden's State of the Union address was confidence-inspiring Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume shares his key takeaway from President Biden's second State of the Union address.NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!
  Joe Biden is running for president again and his second State of the Union address was his campaign manifesto headlined by the notion of ""finish the job"" as his rallying cry. Most Americans today, however, want Biden to finish up his job and move over for someone else. Clearly, this president has no intention of backing down from an all-out effort to stay in office even as polls show a majority of Democrats want him to stick to one term.  First, let’s cover what was not in the speech. Inflation – the nation’s number one problem – got almost no mention. In the world of this speech there was no Afghanistan, no crisis at the border, no criminals outside of identity fraudsters and fentanyl runners, no multi-billion-dollar crypto swindles, and of course no deficit or need to restrain spending. There was a passing reference to America’s dropping educational standards but no plan to raise them and better educate our children. There was no big tech restraint on censorship, no call to take violent criminals off our streets, no call to strengthen families. STATE OF THE UNION: BIDEN LAYS OUT ECONOMIC PLAN, CALLS FOR BIPARTISANSHIP BUT REPEATEDLY CHIDES REPUBLICANSIt was a litany of promises big and small from ending cancer as we know it to dealing with junk fees at airports. The Age of Possibility (another retread theme) knew no limits of government that could not be solved with raising taxes on billionaires and auditing the rich.  In 1995, President Bill Clinton declared, ""the era of big government is over.""  In this State of the Union, Big Government was back bigger than ever.  VideoMuch of the speech was classic Democratic red meat. He railed against big corporations labeling them as way undertaxed, Big Pharma as overcharging for Insulin, and oil companies refusing to invest their fat profits in America. The big gamble of President Biden's peech, and of his nascent re-election campaign, is how he can raise his poor job ratings with new taxes and big promises while sidestepping or ignoring the kitchen-table issues of inflation, immigration and crime . He was bringing back manufacturing jobs, forcing down the cost of prescription drugs and protecting our seniors by threatening to veto efforts to undo Social Security and Medicare. He offered parents more paid leave, students more free tuition and teachers a pay raise. Oil companies need not worry about investing – after all, oil, according to the president, might have a use for the ""next 10 years,"" drawing laughs from the House. IT'S UNLIKELY BIDEN'S RAMBLING STATE OF THE UNION INSPIRED AMERICANS TO 'FINISH THE JOB'The president set up several straw men to knock them down and look tough and resolute. He got into the most trouble trying to label the Republicans as the party threatening Social Security and Medicare, only to be openly challenged by members shouting from the floor, causing him to back down. VideoHe also threatened to veto non-existent laws to abolish abortion that could never pass either chamber. And said he would protect 30 million cashiers from non-existent non-compete contract clauses.The president’s demeanor was feisty, sometimes yelling but most of the time he was strong and assured in his delivery. The liberal press will praise it and say he showed he is ready to keep on serving as president. Others will point out he started off by calling New York Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer the ""minority"" leader and frequently slurred and skipped words. BIDEN BOOED DURING STATE OF THE UNION FOR CLAIMING GOP WANTS TO CUT SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICAREHe was the Angry Optimist – at the same time showing moments of harsh anger and finger-pointing while moments later espousing optimism, hope and possibility. Expectations for Biden are so low, however, that just being able to get through a 75-plus minute speech gives him the edge on this aspect of the speech.  President Joe Biden speaks during a State of the Union address at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday, Feb. 7, 2023.  (Nathan Howard/Bloomberg via Getty Images)The emotional high point of the SOTU was the recognition of the parents of Tyre Nichols and both parties joined together in applauding them and recognizing the injustice that was done to their child. But the president also shaded the events carefully raising the issue of Black parents having the ""talk"" with their children, not mentioning that all the cops involved in Nichols’ death were Black. He did call for bipartisan police reform which could be good news for South Carolina Republican Sen. Tim Scott’s bill which has languished; while he gave some lip service to police and the dangers they face, he offered no significant measures to push back on crime nor make the job of policing easier. In the face of a violent nationwide crime surge, he called for hiring more social workers.  VideoMuch of the first 30 minutes of the president’s speech were devoted to trying to knock down the recent poll finding that most Americans believe the president has done little to help them.  PROGRESSIVES THROW SHADE AT MANCHIN, SINEMA FOR BLOCKING MASSIVE SPENDING IN STATE OF THE UNION RESPONSEHe started off with the semiconductor bill, an odd place to start, and took credit for lower prescription drug prices. He also took credit for job increases and spending reductions without mentioning that they were the result of the end of the pandemic rather than caused by policies of the administration.He resolutely pushed for raising the debt ceiling without future restraint on spending even though polling shows that most Americans want to see an end to the spending that they think is to blame for the inflation affecting their economic lives. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERForeign policy got short shrift in this speech. While there was a tepid calling out of Putin and of China, there was no explicit mention of the shooting down of the Chinese spy balloon on Saturday which carried sensors and surveillance equipment. Most important however was the clear omission of any discussion of Iran, Israel or the Middle East. He knew that bringing up terrorist threats to Israel could have divided his party as the left has turned against Israel and he wanted to avoid angering the Squad. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPOverall, the big gamble of the speech, and of his nascent re-election campaign, is how the president can raise his poor job ratings with new taxes and big promises while sidestepping or ignoring the kitchen-table issues of inflation, immigration and crime on the minds of many Americans who see the country as headed in the wrong direction. The press, however, is beginning to ask questions, and he might also even get a few about classified documents, pesky laptops and Chinese spy balloons. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM MARK PENN  Mark J.

Employers with religious convictions against contraception would still be allowed to avoid offering contraception coverage under the Biden rule.Religious liberty groups describe the proposed rule as an administrative attempt by Democrats to force employers into providing contraceptive services after their effort in the courts failed, most notably in the Supreme Court case Little Sisters of the Poor Saints Peter and Paul Home v. Pennsylvania. Matt Bowman, a senior counsel at the Alliance Defending Freedom, said that Supreme Court case showed it was permissable to exempt companies with a moral objection to contraception, and said the Biden administration is now trying to do through executive power what it could not do through the courts.""Their proposal is to say that it is illegitimate to have moral views in opposition to the Biden administration and then to use taxpayer dollars to bail out political allies,"" Bowman told Fox News Digital.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.A Manhattan man’s discussion with his orthopedic surgeon days before his total hip replacement surgery resulted in a stunning discovery about his heart. David Holland, 57, said his orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Vladimir Shur, PhD and chief of trauma service in the Department of Orthopedics at Mount Sinai-Beth Israel in New York City, decided to delay Holland’s surgery after discovering that Holland had a heart murmur. Despite Holland’s assurance that he'd had his murmur since childhood and had no symptoms of heart disease, the surgeon insisted he get it checked out before surgery.AMERICAN HEART MONTH: ADD THESE HEART-HEALTHY FOODS RECOMMENDED BY EXPERTS TO YOUR GROCERY LISTHolland told Fox News Digital that he was active prior to his hip issue — he played hockey and tennis throughout his 30s. Pain in his hip, not a heart issue, was limiting his activity level, he said. ""I took statins for high cholesterol, but other than that I had no idea anything was wrong,"" he said.

""I thought overkill — just never had any issues,"" said Holland. ""I thought he was being overcautious.""Shur told Fox News Digital that as an orthopedic trauma specialist and joint replacement surgeon, he believes it is important to be thorough. ""I am not just putting metal into a patient,"" said. ""The patient has to be looked at medically,"" he said — noting that it is ""very important to be sure the patient is fit for surgery before it is too late.""  David Holland thought he would be having a hip replaced. Instead, he wound up having quadruple bypass surgery. He credits his doctors for their ""seamless"" teamwork on his surgery and for potentially saving his life.  (David Holland and Melanie Seymour/iStock)Shur sent Holland to Dr. Maurice Rachko, a cardiologist at Mount Sinai Beth Israel Hospital who performed a simple non-invasive test called a calcium score screening heart test.  HEART ATTACK RISK CAN BE FOUND THROUGH NON-INVASIVE CALCIUM SCORE SCREENING SCANA normal calcium score test is less than 10. Holland’s score was 2,060.An angiogram revealed that Holland had four blocked coronary arteries of his heart.  That result led Holland to Dr. John Fox, an interventional cardiologist at Mount Sinai Beth Israel Hospital. He conducted an angiogram that revealed Holland had four blocked coronary arteries of his heart. Holland shared that Dr. Fox told him that the coronary arteries were so blocked the doctors could not use stents.Dr. Fox quickly consulted with Dr. John Puskas, chair of cardiovascular surgery at Mount Sinai Morningside Hospital in New York City's Upper West Side, where Holland had the surgery within days of the angiogram.   ""I went in for a hip — and instead got heart surgery,"" said David Holland of New York City to Fox News Digital.  (iStock)""I went in for a hip — and instead got heart surgery,"" Holland said.He added, ""The teamwork was seamless between the doctors."" Non-invasive procedureThe test that raised the red flag is called a calcium score screening heart test. It is a non-invasive procedure that involves placing an IV in the arm and a quick pass through a CT scan that measures calcium deposits in the coronary arteries of the heart, cardiac specialists told Fox News Digital. Calcium score testing is a ""big breakthrough"" in terms of screening for heart disease.  A higher coronary calcium score suggests the person has a higher risk of narrowing in the coronary arteries and an increased chance of a future heart attack, according to heart specialists.AMERICAN HEART MONTH: HERE'S HOW LONELINESS, ISOLATION CAN INCREASE YOUR RISK OF HEART DISEASEPuskas said in an interview that calcium score testing is a ""big breakthrough"" in terms of screening for heart disease. ""The latest CT scanners are relatively low radiation, so it's really a very benign, non-invasive test. It has a very strong predictive value in identifying a patient who has important blockages of the coronary arteries even before they become symptomatic.""Dr. Puskas said patients often think they are asymptomatic because they do not recognize the symptoms — and in some cases they even mistake heart pain as heartburn related to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).  Dr. John Puskas (on left) and patient David Holland. ""The [cardiac] calcium score is a very objective way of identifying those patients and getting them on the pathway toward treatment before they have a big heart attack,"" said Dr. Puskas.  (Mount Sinai Morningside)""The GERD is actually angina. It's heart pain, not heartburn. It is not coming from the stomach. It's coming from the heart, but it's been treated with Tums or antacids or whatever,"" he said. Puskas added, ""The [cardiac] calcium score is a very objective way of identifying those patients and getting them on the pathway toward treatment before they have a big heart attack. It is one thing to have a heart attack and then a coronary bypass operation. It is much better to have the coronary bypass instead of a heart attack to prevent that heart attack."" ""It's sort of the latest and greatest way of doing coronary bypass surgery."" He concluded, ""That really is the fundamental benefit of coronary surgery. It's to prevent a heart attack."" Puskas said that CT scanners are becoming more sophisticated. ""We now have CT scanners that will tell us not just how much calcium is in the coronary arteries, but how tight the blockages are in the coronary arteries."" Puskas also said Holland underwent a unique type of open-heart surgery rarely performed in the United States.   Dr. John Puskas (left) and patient David Holland, who underwent a unique type of quadruple bypass surgery in November 2022.  (Mount Sinai Morningside)Holland underwent an ""all arterial, no aortic touch, off–pump, quadruple bypass surgery,"" he said. It's a surgery performed in less than 1% of patients in the United States, according to the cardiovascular specialist.  The heart is not stopped during the surgery, he said. There is no use of a heart-lung machine, and the aorta (a big artery in the chest near the heart) is not clamped during the procedure. 5 SIMPLE AND HEALTHY DIET SWAPS TO MANAGE YOUR CHOLESTEROL LEVELSBy avoiding clamping the aorta during surgery, the risk of stroke is reduced, the surgeon explained to Fox News Digital. This type of surgery rewires arteries from the patient’s chest and one from the arm to help provide blood flow to the heart, instead of using veins stripped from the legs.  Puskas also said this type of surgery actually rewires arteries from the patient’s chest and one from the arm to help provide blood flow to the heart, instead of using veins stripped from the legs. ""It's sort of the latest and greatest way of doing coronary bypass surgery. Quite different from a surgery that was designed in the '70s and which is still the most common way of doing it,"" he said.The heart surgeon explained the benefits of using artery vs. vein grafts to do a coronary bypass, especially in a younger patient.  Dr. John Puskas (left) and heart patient David Holland of New York City. Holland said he is recovering well since his surgery this past November.  (Mount Sinai Morningside)""We know the arteries will last longer than the veins.

Veins are designed for a low-pressure environment. When we take veins from the legs and attach [them] to the heart, they are now in a high pressure situation — and they don't last as long as arteries."" The vein grafts tend to wear out in a decade, said Puskas.  ""Half of veins will have closed in 10 years. That's OK if you're 77. But [this patient is] 57. So we want to give him an operation that's going to last decades.""5 SIMPLE WAYS TO PREVENT HEART DISEASE THIS YEARHolland said he is recovering well since his surgery this past November. ""I went in on Monday and [was] home Thursday,"" he said. Within a week, he was ""able to walk a mile and a half without stopping,"" he proudly said. He credits Dr. Shur with potentially saving his life, thanks to his thoroughness. ""The safety of our patients is our first priority.""

" close      Video Former Iranian official writes letter to Iran's Supreme Leader over protests Fox News correspondent Amy Kellogg interviews former Iranian diplomat, Mehrdad Khonsari, on the country's ongoing protests. 'No way to turn clock back.'Iran has enough highly enriched uranium to build ""several"" nuclear weapons if it chooses, the United Nations’ top nuclear official is now warning. But diplomatic efforts aimed at again limiting its atomic program seem more unlikely than ever before as Tehran arms Russia in its war on Ukraine and as unrest shakes the Islamic Republic.While offering a caveat on Tuesday that ""we need to be extremely careful"" in describing Iran’s program, Rafael Mariaono Grossi of the International Atomic Energy Agency bluntly acknowledged just how large Tehran’s high-enriched uranium stockpile had grown.""One thing is true: They have amassed enough nuclear material for several nuclear weapons, not one at this point,"" Grossi said.Gross assured a European Parliament subcommittee in Brussels on Wednesday that Iran has not yet built a nuclear weapon and the West should redouble efforts to stop them from doing so. Even at the height of previous tensions between the West and Iran, before the 2015 nuclear deal, Iran never enriched uranium as high as it does now.For months, nonproliferation experts have suggested Iran had enough uranium enriched up to 60% to build at least one nuclear weapon — though Tehran long has insisted its program is for peaceful purposes. Uranium enriched to more than 90% can be weaponized. Iran has 70 kilograms (154 pounds) of uranium enriched to 60% purity and 1,000 kilograms to 20% purity, Grossi shared.

The question is at what stage can we stop Iran from getting the bomb,"" Netanyahu said.IRAN HOLDS TOP MILITARY DRILLS IN MAJOR OIL WATERWAY IN 'WAR BEFORE THE WAR'Analysts point to what happened with North Korea, which had reached a 1994 deal with the U.S. to abandon its nuclear weapons program. The deal fell apart in 2002. By 2005 and wary of U.S. intentions after its invasion of Iraq, Pyongyang announced it had built nuclear weapons. Today, North Korea has ballistic missiles designed to carry nuclear warheads that are capable of reaching the U.S.Iranian diplomats for years have pointed to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s preachings as a binding fatwa, or religious edict, that Iran wouldn’t seek an atomic bomb. However, Iranian officials in recent months have begun openly talking about the prospect of building nuclear weapons.Talks between Iran and the West ended in August with a ""final text"" of a roadmap on restoring the 2015 deal that Iran until today hasn’t accepted.

They go well beyond the scope of the JCPOA,"" Price said, using the acronym for the deal, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.Critics say the Biden administration’s statements over this month show its unfailing allegiance to JCPOA that, according to one U.S. think tank study, would funnel $275 billion in benefits to Tehran in its first year and $1 trillion by 2030. A spokesman for Senator Cruz, R-Texas, told Fox News Digital that ""Sen. Cruz believes that the Biden administration is ideologically obsessed with reentering a nuclear deal with Iran, and that they are doing everything possible to keep that possibility open. He believes that they prioritize the deal above other critical interests they claim they have, including supporting the women-led protests against the Iranian regime and helping our Ukrainian allies take out the Russian and Iranian forces using drones to devastate Ukrainian military and civilian targets.""

It remains unclear what Tehran, which has a strained history with Moscow, expects to get for supplying Russia with arms. One Iranian lawmaker has suggested the Islamic Republic could get Sukhoi Su-35 fighter jets to replace its aging fleeting composed primarily of pre-1979 American warplanes, though such a deal hasn’t been confirmed.Such fighter jets would provide a key air defense for Iran, particularly as its nuclear sites could increasingly be eyed. Israel, which has carried out strikes to halt nuclear programs in Iraq and Syria, has warned it will not allow Iran to obtain a nuclear bomb.The U.S. and Israel also launched their largest-ever joint air, land and sea exercise this week with6,400 US troops participating, more than 1,500 Israeli troop, using over 140 aircraft, 12 naval vessels, High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems and multiple-launch rocket systems, in an operation dubbed Juniper Oak 23.2.Officials at the Pentagon said the operation enhances Washington's ability to respond to contingencies and ""underscores the US commitment to the Middle East region"".The Pentagon described the drill as ""not meant to be oriented around any single adversary or threat."" However, it comes amid the heightened tensions with Iran and includes aerial refueling, targeting and suppressing enemy air defenses — capabilities that would be crucial in conducting airstrikes.For now, Grossi said there was ""almost no diplomatic activity"" over trying to restore the Iran nuclear deal, an agreement he now describes as ""an empty shell.""

Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., after House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., announced plans to remove her from the House Foreign Affairs Committee, with the head of the Democratic Caucus predicting that Republicans will join him in an effort to keep her there.During a news conference Wednesday morning, House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., fielded a question about Omar's potential ouster from the committee and offered a reminder that Omar is not automatically off the committee just because McCarthy made the announcement.""It would take a vote and a resolution for that to happen and the Democratic Caucus stands with Representative Omar that she should serve on this committee. And we’ll see how Republicans want to handle this,"" Aguilar said.Omar has upset colleagues in the past with anti-Israel statements that have played on antisemitic tropes, such as when she said, ""It's all about the Benjamins, baby"" to explain why McCarthy criticized her for opposing the Jewish State.

" close      Video Rep. Hank Johnson suggests classified docs in Biden's home and office may have been 'planted', supports special counsel investigation Democratic Rep. Hank Johnson tells Fox News he would not rule out the possibility that classified documents may have been ""planted"" in Biden's office or home, but said he supports a special counsel investigation. Rep. Hank Johnson, a Democrat, has represented his area of Georgia in the House of Representatives for more than 15 years.Over the course of those years, Johnson has made some questionable statements from claiming Guam will ""capsize"" due to too many people to comparing Jewish Israeli settlers to ""termites.""Here are some of Johnson's wildest statements since he took office in 2007.DEMOCRATS SCRAMBLE TO DEFEND BIDEN'S HANDLING OF CLASSIFIED MATERIALS, POINT FINGERS AT TRUMP  Probably Democratic Georgia Rep. Hank Johnson's most famous statement was sharing his worry that the U.S. territory of Guam could ""capsize"" if too many people were on the island. (Reuters)Guam will ‘capsize’Probably Johnson's most famous statement was sharing his worry that the U.S. territory of Guam could ""capsize"" if too many people were on the island.Johnson made his widely-ridiculed claim during a 2010 House Armed Services Committee hearing on a planned military buildup in the territory that featured now-retired Admiral Robert Willard, who at the time commanded the U.S. Pacific Fleet.""My fear is that the whole island will become so overly populated that it will tip over and capsize,"" Johnson said, his face straight as he gestured the island tipping over.""We don't anticipate that,"" Willard responded after a short pause. ""The Guam population, I think, is currently 175,000.""""And again, with 8,000 Marines and their families, that's an addition of about 25,000 more into the population,"" the admiral continued.Johnson would later claim he was joking when he made the statement.Comparing protesting parents to January 6 riotersEducation is becoming an increasingly hot-button issue for voters, especially parents, as critical race theory and gender ideology are uncovered in schools across America.Critical race theory (CRT), as well as gender ideology in schools — which has seen pornographic material in school libraries, including at the Pentagon — have galvanized parents who do not want to see their child's educational potential whittled down to the color of their skin or pornographic books accessible in class.Johnson claimed during a House Judiciary Committee hearing in September of last year that ""MAGA Republicans"" descended on school board meetings similarly to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot during a committee hearing.  Rep. Hank Johnson, left, claimed during a House Judiciary Committee hearing in September of last year that ""MAGA Republicans"" descended on school board meetings similarly to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot during a committee hearing. (Getty Images/The Recording Academy)""January 6, 2021, will never be forgotten, an infamous day in American history. MAGA Republicans descended upon the Capitol, engaged in an insurrection. They occupied the Capitol. Five people were killed, hundreds injured, including hundreds of Capitol Hill police officers attacked and bludgeoned. It was a day that we’ll never forget,"" Johnson said.""And people on the local level at affected school board meetings, they won’t forget the MAGA Republicans descending on their school board meetings after January 6, like January 6, disrupting meetings. It was a coordinated attack happening across the country. Americans won’t forget about it. School board members, teachers, administrators, subjected to violence, threats of violence, harassment, intimidation,"" he continued.Johnson made this claim during a hearing to discuss a House bill requiring President Biden to ""provide certain documents to the House of Representatives relating to the October 4, 2021 memorandum issued by the Attorney General entitled Partnership Among Federal, State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial Law Enforcement to Address Threats Against School Administrators, Board Members, Teachers, and Staff.""In October, Attorney General Merrick Garland originally sent a memorandum on ongoing protests at school boards regarding coronavirus guidelines and critical race theory. Garland’s memo was in response to the National School Boards Association's (NSBA) letter that likened these protests to ""domestic terrorism,"" leading to intense backlash from parents and Republican lawmakers. By February, Fox News exclusively reported that the head of the NSBA had advanced notice of the memo, suggesting coordination between the NSBA and the federal government against protesters. Biden's 'planted' classified documentsMost recently, Johnson has been playing defense for Biden amid the classified documents' scandal that has rocked the West Wing.Johnson was asked by Fox News' Hillary Vaughn about Biden's Obama-era classified documents being found in unsecured locations in and outside Washington, D.C., which Johnson claimed the documents may have been ""planted.""""I'm also aware of the fact that things can be planted on people ... things can be planted in places and then discovered conveniently,"" Johnson said. ""That may be what has occurred here. I'm not ruling that out. But I'm open in terms of the investigation needs to be investigated.""Several batches of Obama-era classified documents have been found by Biden's attorneys, including in his Penn Biden Center think tank in the nation's capital as well as in his Wilmington, Delaware, home's garage next to his Corvette.The Georgia Democrat also said he was ""suspicious of the timing"" surrounding the classified document batches' discoveries.  Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., was asked by Fox News' Hillary Vaughn about President Biden's Obama-era classified documents being found in unsecured locations in and outside Washington, D.C., which Johnson claimed the documents may have been ""planted."" (CQ-Roll Call/Getty Images)Johnson attempted to highlight ""big differences"" between Biden's document scandal and the FBI Mar-a-Lago raid of former President Trump, claiming it was ""refreshing to see the Department of Justice restored from its politicization during the Trump years"" and that he applauded ""Attorney General Garland for acting swiftly in appointing a special counsel to investigate the Biden document discoveries.""""Based on what we know, there is a big difference between the Trump and Biden document cases,"" Johnson claimed. ""At first, Trump lied about their very existence, while his lawyers asserted that there were no more documents. When Trump finally admitted that he knowingly took and possessed the classified documents, he refused numerous requests to return them. He even failed to comply with a subpoena,"" he continued. ""Classified documents were actually seized from Trump’s own desk. Moreover, there is no documentation supporting any claim that any of the Trump documents were declassified.""""The Trump document case is an open-and-shut case and should proceed without delay to a final and just resolution,"" he said. ""There remains much we don’t know about the Biden document discoveries, and it’s too early to reach any conclusions. I am confident, however, that the process has begun to ensure that we get to the truth, and that justice will be done.""The ‘racist Senate’ and Chip Roy's ‘White power’Last year amid progressive Democrats' voting overhaul push that did not make it to print in the face of a bipartisan Senate majority, Johnson claimed that, ""in some respects,"" the U.S. had a ""racist Senate"" presiding over it.He accused Texas Republican Rep. Chip Roy of pushing ""White power"" and ""White privilege"" for objecting to his claims.""Voting rights is not going away even though the Senate last night failed to do what it should have done and in some respects, we can call it a racist Senate,"" Johnson said during a January 2022 House Judiciary Committee remote hearing.  Johnson accused Texas Republican Rep. Chip Roy of pushing ""White power"" and ""White privilege"" for objecting to his claims that America was presided over by a ""racist Senate."" (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)""The same way we can talk about racism when it comes to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle making statements today about Black people and Democrats race-baiting,"" Johnson said. ""It’s like, you know, when you mention about how much racism still exists in the soil of America they want to plant their heads in that soil and refuse to acknowledge what’s in the soil.""The Georgia Democrat was referring to his Texas GOP colleague Rep. Chip Roy's earlier statement in the hearing, who used the term ""race-baiting"" to describe Democrat claims of ""voter suppression"" and the party's unsuccessful efforts to push the federal election overhaul.REP. HANK JOHNSON COMPARES PROTESTING PARENTS AT SCHOOL BOARDS TO JAN. 6 RIOTERSJohnson went on to say that Republicans have become ""emboldened"" due to former President Trump and what Johnson called his ""Make America White Again"" movement while also using the terms ""White power"" and ""White privilege"" to describe Roy.""I’m just blown away by where we have fallen in our discourse on this committee,"" Johnson added after accusing Roy and the Senate of racism.Later in the meeting, Roy addressed the ""White privilege"" label that Johnson had placed on him and explained that his grandmother was raised by a single mom in West Texas in a house with a dirt floor and no indoor plumbing. Roy also detailed the struggles his family has had to endure including family members growing up ""dirt poor"" during the Depression and his father working himself through college while also suffering from polio.""I would question the assertion of my ‘privilege’ and ‘White power,’"" Roy said.  Rep. Hank Johnson took heat in 2016 when he at a U.S. Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation event when he compared Jewish Israeli settlers in disputed areas with Palestinians to ""termites"" eating homes. (CQ-Roll Call/Getty Images)""Democrats have nothing left to play but the race card given a year of devastating crime, open borders, appeasement of our enemies, and failed COVID policies,"" Roy told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""So you accuse the grandson of an orphaned poor West Texas farmer who lost his farm in the Depression of ‘white privilege’ and you go back to race-bating. Par for the course.""Calling Jewish Israeli settlers in disputed areas 'termites'Johnson took heat in 2016 when he compared Jewish Israeli settlers in disputed areas with Palestinians to ""termites"" eating homes at a U.S. Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation event.The U.S. Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation is an anti-Israel organization that promotes the anti-Semitic Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement targeting Israel.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP""There has been a steady [stream], almost like termites can get into a residence and eat before you know that you’ve been eaten up and you fall in on yourself, there has been settlement activity that has marched forward with impunity and at an ever-increasing rate to the point where it has become alarming,"" Johnson said.Johnson also claimed that ""Jewish people"" steal property and land from Palestinians.Johnson's office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's media request on Sunday.Fox News Digital's Andrew Mark Miller and Lindsay Kornick contributed reporting.
