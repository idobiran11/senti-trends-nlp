The views expressed here are his own. Read more opinion at CNN. (CNN)Long before the current war in Ukraine began nearly a year ago, Israel has maintained strict neutrality in the hostilities between Russia and Ukraine. That may be about to change.Anshel Pfeffer Since he came to power at the end of 1999, Russian President Vladimir Putin has gone out of his way to court the Israeli leadership. He made sure to hold a meeting at least once a year with the serving Israeli prime minister, usually at his residences in Sochi or Moscow, and every few years he would travel to Jerusalem.A former Russian diplomat explained to me that ""Putin respects strength and sees Israel as a strong country with which he wants to be on good terms.""The same is true of Israel's leaders, especially of Benjamin Netanyahu, the country's longest-serving prime minister who returned to office at the end of 2022. Read MoreNetanyahu was so proud of what he claimed was a close relationship with Putin that in 2019 he used photographs of them together as part of his election campaign. He has claimed on multiple occasions that their relationship was advantageous to Israel's strategic interests.One instance of this was when Russia first deployed its military to war-torn Syria in September 2015 to prop up President Bashar Assad's blood-soaked regime. Within days, Netanyahu was in Moscow at the head of a military delegation for an unscheduled meeting with Putin.The two leaders reached an agreement whereby Israel would continue to operate in Syrian airspace but would only attack targets linked to its enemy Iran, while leaving Assad's forces untouched. A ""deconfliction mechanism,"" including a hotline between the Russian command center in Syria and Israel's air force headquarters, was swiftly established.Opinion: Netanyahu wants peace, but offers few solutionsOver the years, senior Israeli officials have been at pains to emphasize that while Israel's chief strategic ally remains the United States, it was crucial to maintain coordination with the Russians. In 2014, despite pressure from Washington, Israel refused to join the western governments in condemning Russia's annexation of Crimea. Strict neutrality was to be maintained throughout.When Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24 last year, Netanyahu was not in office. The prime minister was Naftali Bennett and he stuck to the neutrality policy. Bennett explained to me that ""we are not in the same position as other countries. We have Russia just over our border in Syria. We have to take into consideration the presence of large Jewish communities in both Russia and Ukraine which could be impacted. And besides, it's useful for everyone to have a government like Israel which has good ties with both sides to serve as a go-between."" In the early weeks of the war, Bennett embarked on a peace mission in which he both visited Putin in the Kremlin and had multiple conversations with Ukrainian President Vlodymyr Zelensky. He insists that ""there was a 50% chance of reaching a ceasefire, sadly it failed."" He also claims that his involvement helped broker short-term local truces, which allowed saving civilians from the war zone. Opinion: Don't expect Biden to confront Netanyahu anytime soon Any hope of a ceasefire has long vanished, and Ukraine has since publicly requested Israel help supply it with arms, especially with missile defense systems like the Iron Dome. Israel has sent humanitarian aid but has refused to send any weapons. In recent months, as Russia began using Iranian drones to attack Ukrainian targets, Israel has agreed to supply Kyiv, through NATO, with intelligence and technical information on how to counter the Iranian drone threat.Not everyone in the Israeli leadership agreed with Bennett's neutral policy. His political partner and then-foreign minister Yair Lapid was more forthright in publicly condemning Russian war crimes in Ukraine. Opinions were divided in the country's security establishment as well. One Israeli general told me that ""the fear of Russia is overblown and Israel could have been much more supportive of Ukraine without any fear of retribution.""Ten months after the Russian invasion, Netanyahu returned to office. Suddenly he was a lot less friendly toward Putin. He took one congratulatory phone call from him a week before his inauguration, but that was all. Meanwhile, in media interviews, he has said that he is reconsidering Israel's policy on the Ukraine war, though he wouldn't specify any details.One Israeli general told me that ""the fear of Russia is overblown and Israel could have been much more supportive of Ukraine without any fear of retribution.""Anshel Pfeffer""Netanyahu has two immediate reasons for changing policy and supporting Ukraine,"" a former Israeli intelligence officer who was deeply involved in Israel's military relationship with Russia, told me.""First, Russia has greatly diluted its forces in Syria as they were needed in Ukraine. The threat to Israel from them is now negligible,"" the officer said.""Second, Russia is now using Iranian drones and missiles on the battlefield and Israel now has a valuable opportunity to supply Ukraine with defense systems so we can see how well they do in an actual war. One day we may have to face the same Iranian weapons,"" the officer added. An Israeli diplomat adds another reason why Netanyahu would consider supporting Ukraine more forcefully. Unlike the Bennett-Lapid government, his new coalition of far-right and ultra-religious parties is regarded with suspicion by the Biden administration that has already voiced its displeasure with the new government's plans for a legal overhaul, which drastically weaken the powers and independence of Israel's supreme court.Get our free weekly newsletterSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook Last week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Jerusalem, and unlike on such visits in the past, didn't extend the Prime Minister an invitation to the White House.An Israeli shift toward Kyiv could be Netanyahu's best hope of currying favor with Washington.",Opinion: Why Netanyahu is suddenly a lot less friendly with Putin,CNN,2023-02-07T15:24:25Z,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/07/opinions/netanyahu-putin-israel-russia-ukraine-pfeffer/index.html
1,"Hong Kong (CNN)In China's eyes, the newest superpower battlefield sits between 12 and 60 miles above the Earth's surface in a thin-aired layer of the atmosphere it calls ""near space.""Lying above the flightpaths of most commercial and military jets and below satellites, near space is an in-between area for spaceflight to pass through -- but it is also a domain where hypersonic weapons transit and ballistic missiles cross.China has paid close attention to the US' and other countries' developments in the region, which has been hailed by Chinese military experts as ""a new front for militarization"" and ""an important field of competition among the world's military powers."" In addition to developing high-tech vessels such as solar-powered drones and hypersonic vehicles, China is also reviving a decades-old technology to utilize this area of the atmosphere -- lighter-than-air vehicles. They include stratospheric airships and high-altitude balloons -- similar to the one identified over the continental United States and shot down on Saturday.China maintains the balloon is a civilian research airship, despite claims by US officials that the device was part of an extensive Chinese surveillance program. As analysis of recovered parts from the downed device gets underway, a senior State Department official said Thursday that the balloon ""was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations"" and was part of a fleet that had flown over ""more than 40 countries across five continents"" -- a claim China has flatly rejected.Read MoreWhile questions remain about that incident, an examination of Chinese state media reports and scientific papers reveal the country's growing interest in these lighter-than-air vehicles, which Chinese military experts have touted for use toward a wide range of purposes, from communication relay, reconnaissance and surveillance to electronic countermeasures.Near-space ambitionsChinese research on the high-altitude balloons dates back to the late 1970s, but over the past decade there's been renewed focus on using older technology equipped with new hardware as major powers around the world have bulked up their capabilities in the sky.""With the rapid development of modern technology, the space for information confrontation is no longer limited to land, sea, and the low altitude. Near space has also become a new battlefield in modern warfare and an important part of the national security system,"" read a 2018 article in the PLA Daily, the official newspaper of the People's Liberation Army (PLA). And a range of ""near-space flight vehicles"" will play a vital role in future joint combat operations that integrate outer space and the Earth's atmosphere, the article said. Chinese leader Xi Jinping has urged the PLA Air Force to ""speed up air and space integration and sharpen their offensive and defensive capabilities"" as early as 2014, and military experts have designated ""near space"" as a crucial link in the integration.Sailors recover a high-altitude  balloon off the coast of South Carolina on February 5, 2023. Searches on CNKI, China's largest online academic database, show Chinese researchers, both military and civilian, have published more than 1,000 papers and reports on ""near space,"" many of which focus on the development of ""near space flight vehicles."" China has also set up a research center to design and develop high-altitude balloons and stratospheric airships, or dirigibles, under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, a top government think tank. One particular area of interest is surveillance. While China already deploys a sprawling satellite network for sophisticated long-range surveillance, Chinese military experts have highlighted the advantages of lighter-than-air vehicles. Unlike rotating satellites or traveling aircraft, stratospheric airships and high-altitude balloons ""can hover over a fixed location for a long period of time"" and are not easily detected by radar, wrote Shi Hong, the executive editor of Shipborne Weapons, a prominent military magazine published by a PLA-linked institute, in an article published in state media in 2022. Initial classified balloon report wasn't flagged as urgent, drawing criticismIn a 2021 video segment run by state news agency Xinhua, a military expert explains how near-space lighter-than-air vehicles can surveil and take higher resolution photos and videos at a much lower cost compared to satellites.  In the video, Cheng Wanmin, an expert at the National University of Defense Technology, highlighted the progress by the US, Russia and Israel in developing these vehicles, adding China has also made its own ""breakthroughs.""An example of advances China has made in this domain is the reported flight of a 100-meter-long (328 feet) unmanned dirigible-like airship known as ""Cloud Chaser."" In a 2019 interview with the Southern Metropolis Daily newspaper, Wu Zhe, a professor at Beihang University, said the vehicle had transited across Asia, Africa and North America in an around-the-world flight at 20,000 meters (65, 616 feet) above the Earth. Another scientist on the team told the newspaper that compared with satellites, stratospheric airships are better for ""long-term observation"" and have a range of purposes from disaster warning and environmental research to wireless network construction and aerial reconnaissance. Cheng Wanmin, an expert at the National University of Defense Technology, discusses the development of lighter-than-air vehicles in a video segment run by state news agency Xinhua in 2021. Other players, other uses  It's also clear that China is not alone in seeing new uses for a technology that's been leveraged for military reconnaissance as far back as the late 18th century, when French forces employed a balloon corps. The US has also been bolstering its capacity to use lighter-than-air vehicles. In 2021, the US Department of Defense contracted an American aerospace firm to work on using their stratospheric balloons as a means ""to develop a more complete operating picture and apply effects to the battlefield,"" according to a statement from the firm, Raven Aerostar, at the time.  'Total miscalculation': China goes into crisis management mode on balloon fallout""This isn't just a China thing. The US, and other nations as well, have been working on and developing high-altitude aerostats, balloons and similar vehicles,"" said Brendan Mulvaney, director of the China Aerospace Studies Institute (CASI), a research center serving the US Air Force. ""They are cheap, provide long-term persistent stare for collection of imagery, communications and other information -- including weather,"" said Mulvaney, who authored a 2020 paper that detailed China's interest in using lighter-than-air vehicles for ""near-space reconnaissance."" China also appears acutely aware of the potential for other countries to use balloons to spy.In 2019, a documentary series on China's border defense forces produced by a state-owned television channel featured an incident where the PLA Air Force spotted and shot down a suspected high-altitude surveillance balloon that ""threatened (China's) air defense safety.""The documentary did not provide further detail about the time and location of the incident, but a paper published last April by researchers in a PLA institute noted air-drift balloons were spotted over China in 1997 and 2017.Other experts have pointed to the potential use of balloons in data collection that can aid China's development of hypersonic weapons that transit through near space. ""Understanding the atmospheric conditions up there is critical to programming the guidance software"" for ballistic and hypersonic missiles, according to Hawaii-based analyst Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command's Joint Intelligence Center.  Chinese state media reports show China has also used balloons to test advanced hypersonic vehicles. In 2019, state broadcaster CCTV's military channel showed footage of a balloon lifting off for what it described as maiden testing of three miniaturized models of ""wide-range aircraft,"" which according to Chinese media reports, can fly at a wide range of speeds, up to five times the speed of sound. A 2019 report broadcast by state broadcaster CCTV's military channel showed footage of a balloon lifting off for what it described as maiden testing of three miniaturized models of ""wide-range aircraft.""Balloon blind spotUS intelligence officials believe the Chinese balloon identified over the US in recent days is part of an extensive, Chinese military-run surveillance program involving a fleet of balloons that has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years, CNN reported on Tuesday.Beijing on Thursday said the assessment was ""likely part of the US' information and public opinion warfare"" against China. It has maintained that the device identified over the US is civilian in nature, and linked it to ""companies,"" though it declined to provide more information on which entity manufactured the balloons.Both the self-governing island of Taiwan and Japan have acknowledged past, similar sightings, though it is not clear if they are related to the US incident.Spy balloon part of a broader Chinese military surveillance operation, US intel sources sayA US military commander on Monday acknowledged that the US has a ""domain awareness gap"" that allowed three other suspected Chinese spy balloons to transit the continental US undetected during the previous administration.An FBI team is working on understanding more about the equipment reclaimed from the balloon shot down over the sea -- including what kind of data it could collect and whether it could transmit that in real time.CASI's Mulvaney said that whether the balloon itself is characterized as ""dual use"" or ""state-owned,"" data collected would have gone back to China, which is now receiving another kind of information from the incident.""At the end of the day responses and (tactics, techniques, and procedures) from the US and other countries on how they react, or fail to -- all of that has value to China and the PLA.""CNN's Brad Lendon and Eric Cheung contributed to this report.",China wants to dominate the 'near space' battlefield.

6,"A version of this story appears in today's Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, CNN's three-times-a-week look inside the region's biggest stories. Sign up here.Jerusalem (CNN)A shocking 48 hours of violence -- bloody even by the standards of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict -- followed immediately by a fortunately timed flying visit from US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, focused the eyes of the world on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this week. He looked back without blinking. Sitting down for an exclusive interview with CNN's Jake Tapper, he signaled clearly that it is extremely unlikely Israel and the Palestinians will make any measurable progress toward a long-term peace anytime soon. Netanyahu made clear that while he's ""open"" to negotiations with the Palestinians and is willing to cooperate with them on security matters, not much else will move.   Netanyahu has never been a full-throated supporter of a two-state solution, weaving in and out of different definitions of what that would mean. But in recent years he's settled on the idea that he'd be open to a Palestinian state - as long as it has no military or security power, an arrangement that would have no parallel among modern sovereign states. Read More""I'm certainly willing to have them have all the powers that they need to govern themselves, but none of the powers that can threaten us,"" Netanyahu told Tapper in Jerusalem on Tuesday. He did provide some new details about his conversations with President Biden on the matter, explaining he once told Biden, ""[A]ny final agreement between Israel and the Palestinians would have Israel controlling security -- overriding security responsibility in the area west of the Jordan.  Blinken visit reaches new urgency as Israeli, Palestinian tensions boil ""I said, you can't divide who controls the airspace [between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean]. You have to cross it. It takes two minutes for an airplane to cross it. So what, one minute Israel controls it and the other minute the Palestinians? Of course, it's not workable.  ""He said to me, as others have said to me -- 'you know, but that's not perfect sovereignty.'  ""And I said, you're right. But -- I don't know what you'd call it, but it gives them the opportunity to control their lives, to elect their officials, to run their economy, to run their institutions, to have their flag and to have their parliament, but we have to have overriding security control."" Most Palestinians would view that arrangement as a continuation of the current occupation -- and an unacceptable starting point for peace negotiations.  Collective punishment Tapper pressed Netanyahu over accusations that Israel is engaging in collective punishment of Palestinians in the wake of two shooting attacks targeting Israelis around Jerusalem that killed seven and wounded five. Measures announced by the Israeli cabinet in response included issuing more gun permits for civilians, increasing security for Jewish settlements in the West Bank and pushing draft legislation that would possibly revoke the Israeli residency of families of those accused of engaging in or supporting terrorism.  Netanyahu claimed he doesn't ""believe in collective punishment,"" although most human rights organizations call actions targeting the families of attackers exactly that. ""It's not targeting family members. It's targeting family members who were involved in the terror acts or supported it after the act was done ... I think that disincentivizes the terrorists,"" Netanyahu said.  The legislation to revoke residency of families of attackers will likely face legal challenges, something Israeli human rights organization HaMoked has already vowed to do. Arab peace before Palestinian peace Netanyahu made clear to Tapper: His priority is normalization with Arab nations before peace with the Palestinians. After the success of the Abraham Accords, Netanyahu told Tapper he wants to expand the countries in what he calls the ""circle of peace,"" with his top objective being Saudi Arabia. Israel's rightward shift leaves its new Arab allies in an awkward spot For years, peace with the Palestinians was seen as a precondition for any normalization agreements between Arab countries and Israel. But Netanyahu argued the Abraham Accords changed the game. ""I think that the way we're going to succeed is not let the Palestinian tail wag the body of the Arab world,"" he said.  ""If we make peace with Saudi Arabia -- it depends on the Saudi leadership -- and bring, effectively, the Arab-Israeli conflict to an end, I think we will circle back to the Palestinians and get a workable peace with the Palestinians,"" Netanyahu said.  But with rising and concerning levels of violence from all sides, a far-right Israeli government in place under Netanyahu, and a Palestinian Authority led by an increasingly unpopular President Mahmoud Abbas, that may be an overly optimistic game plan. The digest  US cautions Israel on policies, urges Palestinians to improve governance and accountability  Blinken on Tuesday called for Israelis and Palestinians to de-escalate, stop violence and reduce tensions after a meeting with Abbas in the West Bank. He cautioned against Israeli moves including ""things like settlement expansion, the legalization of [Israeli settler] outposts, demolitions and evictions [of Palestinians from their homes], disruptions to the historic status of the holy sites and of course incitement and acquiescence to violence.""  Background: Blinken's visit comes after Palestinians and Israelis suffered significant bloodshed last week. Thursday was the deadliest day for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank in nearly two years, followed by a shooting near a Jerusalem synagogue Friday night, which Israel has deemed one of its worst terror attacks in recent years. Why it matters: Fears had been growing that the situation in Israel and the West Bank could spiral out of control and Blinken's visit was expected to calm tensions. Blinken asked senior State Department officials to remain in the Middle East to help assist with steps that both Israel and the Palestinians have suggested to him ""to lower the temperature.""  Abu Dhabi's IHC to invest $381 million in Adani Enterprises following damaging short seller report Abu Dhabi's International Holding Company (IHC) on Monday announced that it would invest 1.4 billion dirhams ($381 million) in India's Adani Enterprises' follow-on public offering . The investment comes after the Indian conglomerate's market value plummeted around $70 billion following a damaging short seller report.  Background: This is IHC's first investment of the year, and second investment deal with Adani Group after last year's 7.3 billion dirhams ($2 billion) investment in the group's companies. One of India's largest multinational conglomerates, Adani and its owner Gautam Adani -- one of Asia's richest men -- were caught in the crosshairs of a research firm that accused the conglomerate and Adani himself of pulling off ""the largest con in corporate history."" The report and the selloff it sparked erased some $70 billion in market value across Adani Group companies. Adani said it complied with all local laws and had made the necessary regulatory disclosures. Why it matters: The investment deal comes as IHC aims to increase its global acquisitions by 70% in 2023. Abu Dhabi's largest listed company, IHC's market value more than doubled last year. It is chaired by Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the influential UAE national security adviser and a brother of the UAE's president.  Iran, Russia link banking systems amid Western sanction Iran and Russia have connected their interbank communication and transfer systems to help boost trade and financial transactions, Reuters cited a senior Iranian official as saying on Monday, as both Tehran and Moscow are chafing under Western sanctions.

Background: Since the 2018 reimposition of US sanctions on Iran after Washington ditched Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, the Islamic Republic has been disconnected from the Belgium-based SWIFT financial messaging service, which is a key international banking access point. Similar limitations have been slapped on some Russian banks since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine last year. Why it matters: Since the start of the Ukraine war, Tehran and Moscow have acted to forge close bilateral ties as both capitals attempt to build new economic and diplomatic partnerships elsewhere. With deepening economic misery, many Iranians are feeling the pain of galloping inflation and rising joblessness. Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei said on Monday that the establishment faced ""a tangible welfare and livelihood problem"" that could not be cured without economic growth. 11.4% The turnout in Tunisia's parliamentary runoff elections on Sunday, Reuters cited the country's electoral commission as saying. President Kais Saied on Monday blamed the low turnout on hatred among voters of the parliament, calling it ""an institution of absurdity and a state within the state."" His critics said the turnout was evidence of public disdain for his agenda and seizure of powers, and opposition parties called for his resignation.

Emirates airline had to return to Dubai on its way to Auckland, New Zealand, on Friday when the destination city's airport closed due to flooding.  The Airbus A380 superjumbo turned back upon reaching west of Indonesia, more than a third of the way to Auckland, a map from flight tracking site Flightradar24 showed. New Zealand's biggest city has been inundated with record rain. An estimated 240 millimeters of rainfall (9.8 inches) -- equal to an entire summer's worth of rain -- fell on Auckland Friday, making it the city's wettest day on record. The rain caused widespread travel disruption over the weekend. More than 2,000 people stayed overnight Friday in the airport's terminals due to the flooding, the airport said. Domestic flights resumed Saturday but the international terminal was not operational until Sunday. Emirates resumed the Auckland route, its longest at 14,200 kilometers (8,800 miles), in December after an almost three-year hiatus due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The flight takes between 16 and 17 hours and is among the world's longest nonstop commercial routes.

7," (CNN)Thousands of people in Turkey and Syria have been killed and thousands more were injured after a magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck Turkey's Gaziantep province near the Syrian border early Monday.The earthquake is the strongest to hit Turkey since 1939, when a quake of the same magnitude killed more than 30,000 people. Tremors from Monday's earthquake and its aftershocks have been recorded across the region so far, including in Lebanon, Israel, Iraq and Jordan.A magnitude 6.7 aftershock followed 11 minutes after the first earthquake, as well as a 7.5 aftershock several hours later at 1:24 p.m. local time, according to the US Geological Survey. The magnitude 7.5 aftershock is the strongest of more than 100 aftershocks that have been recorded within 36 hours of the initial earthquake.Tremors from the magnitude 7.5 aftershock were recorded throughout Turkey and Syria, as well as in parts of Iraq.Turkey is located at the intersection of four tectonic plates and that makes it an earthquake-prone country. The Arabian plate is moving an estimated 20mm per year towards the Anatolian plate, and this is what caused this week's earthquake along the East Anatolian fault line in the south of the country. A relatively shallow depth contributed to the intensity of the shaking.Read MoreCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the death toll in the 1939 earthquake in Turkey, which claimed the lives of more than 30,000 people.",Map: Aftershocks felt across the region after major earthquake hits Turkey,CNN,2023-02-06T15:49:15Z,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/06/world/turkey-syria-earthquake-epicenter-maps-dg/index.html
8,"A version of this story appears in today's Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, CNN's three-times-a-week look inside the region's biggest stories. Sign up here.Abu Dhabi, UAE (CNN)As the Ukraine war approaches the one-year mark, the United States is ramping up efforts to choke off Russia's economy and it has set its sight on the Middle East. A top US Treasury official arrived in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on Monday to warn the regional business hub that helping Moscow evade sanctions wouldn't be without consequences.  Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Brian E. Nelson, met with senior government officials from several UAE ministries, where he discussed ""rooting out evasion of US sanctions, particularly on Russia and Iran,"" as well as the US' ""commitment to take additional actions against those evading or facilitating the evasion of sanctions,"" according to a statement. The US Treasury earlier warned that ""individuals and institutions operating in permissive jurisdictions,"" including in the UAE and Turkey, risk losing access to G7 markets for doing business with sanctioned entities or not conducting appropriate due diligence against illicit finance. G7 countries include Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US. Read MoreThe Gulf state has walked a tightrope between Washington and Moscow since the start of the Ukraine war last February, opting to remain neutral as it sees the world order moving toward multi polarity. The US has repeatedly called on its Middle Eastern allies to support its efforts in slowing the Russian war machine, but a public threat of consequences against a close ally like the UAE is rare.  Why Biden's key Mideast allies aren't condemning Russia's Ukraine invasion ""What we're seeing now is a bit more about messaging to the region and indicating the seriousness of these sanctions,"" said Justine Walker, global head of sanctions, compliance and risk at the Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists (ACAMS). The US is trying to say, ""If you are going to do business with Russia, then you do business with Russia but you don't do business with us,"" she told CNN. Since the war, the UAE has become the top Arab destination for Russian investors, with the Gulf state's real estate market surging as Russians flock into Dubai and Abu Dhabi. The US has previously sanctioned entities and individuals in the UAE for sanctions evasion. More recently, it sanctioned two UAE-based air transportation firms for collaborating with a sanctioned Iranian firm to transport Iranian UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles), personnel, and related equipment from Iran to Russia.  A Friday statement published on the UAE state news agency WAM said that, during the visit, US and UAE officials discussed enhancing cooperation with regards to ""ongoing sanctions programmes and associated designations of key networks around the world.""  The two sides also discussed combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism both locally and internationally, added the statement. Russia is already under a barrage of sanctions from the US, along with the UK and the European Union. But most of those are primary sanctions, which only apply within the territory of the sanctioning country.  For instance, if a Russian bank is under primary US sanctions, it cannot operate in a US market. The bank can still, however, work with a UAE or Turkish bank. Sanctioned countries often stay afloat by finding loopholes to conduct business outside the US. Washington plugs that loophole by imposing secondary sanctions, which punish parties conducting commercial activities with the sanctioned entities -- even when the activity takes place outside US territory. Such sanctions force countries and entities to choose between the sanctioned nation or the US, but not both.  A senior US official told CNN that the US ""will continue to use our authorities and all tools at our disposal to crack down on sanctions evasion that supports Putin's war machine."" Asked if the US is effectively imposing secondary sanctions on Russia by asking the UAE to crack down on business with the country, the official said ""no."" The US sees Russia circumventing sanctions by moving trade through the Middle East, as well as trading directly with the region, said Walker. As the US dominates the global economy, secondary sanctions have often been effective in causing economic damage to the sanctioned country. But Walker sees their imposition in this case as unlikely, noting that it would be ""serious diplomatic escalation in tensions"" between the UAE and the US. Russia's rise to queen on the Middle East's fractured chessboardThe UAE has invested tens of billions of dollars in the US economy, mostly through its sovereign wealth funds. In 2020, investors from the UAE accounted for about $45 billion of investment flows to the US, according to Abu Dhabi's state-backed The National newspaper. That's a 65% rise from the previous year. Bilateral trade between the US and the UAE exceeded $23.03 billion in 2021. The US' sixth largest trade surplus globally is with the UAE, and the close economic partnership between the two states supports more than 120,000 American jobs, according to the UAE embassy in Washington, DC.  ""We are doing a lot of services for the Americans. They should be grateful to us rather than come up with this language,"" said Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a UAE political science professor, referring to the US' warning about G7 markets. ""American sanctions are American sanctions. They are not UN sanctions and countries can pick and choose. We have dealings with 190 different countries, and Russia is one of them."" Abdulla says the US Treasury concerns are not new and that Washington knows ""very well that we (the UAE) have healthy, ongoing conversations on everything, including these sanctions."" ""The UAE is as vigilant as any country, monitoring every single dollar that comes in, every single transaction -- be it Russian or otherwise,"" Abdulla told CNN, adding that the UAE ""should not be singled out"" for having an open financial market. The US official told CNN that while Washington is ""focused on some critical issues"" it sees in the UAE and Turkey, the two countries ""are not being singled out."" ""This is a conversation we are having with many partners and other countries around the globe,"" added the official. Karen Young, senior research scholar at Columbia's Center on Global Energy Policy, said the US is unlikely to publicly chastise the UAE due to the two countries' cooperation on other files such as relations with Israel and energy, but added that the economic benefit to the UAE from the surge in business from Russians is nevertheless too important to jeopardize.  The digest Israel and Sudan finalize peace agreement draft, Israeli foreign minister says Israel and Sudan have finalized the text of a peace agreement to be signed ""later this year,"" Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen said on Thursday.  Background: Sudan was part of the original Abraham Accord normalization agreements between Israel and the UAE, Bahrain and Morocco brokered by the administration of former US President Donald Trump. But after a military coup in Sudan in October 2021, the final steps of the process with Khartoum were stalled. Why it matters: Cohen said that the signing would ""serve as an opportunity for the establishment of relations with other countries in Africa as well as the strengthening of existing ties with African countries."" The agreement comes after Israel swore in the most right-wing government in its history in December, leaving its new Arab allies in an awkward spot.  Top Iranian filmmaker goes on hunger strike in prison  Iranian film director and screenwriter Jafar Panahi went on a hunger strike in the notorious Evin prison to protest his detention, according to the activist group Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA). Background: Panahi is one of Iran's most influential filmmakers. He is a Cannes film festival award winner and director of movies such as ""The White Balloon,"" ""The Circle"" and ""No Bears."" In 2010, the director was sentenced to six years in prison and banned from filmmaking for 20 years, as well as from leaving the country. This verdict was upheld on appeal. On July 11, 2022, Panahi was arrested in front of Evin prison to serve his sentence, HRANA reported. Why it matters: According to the Artistic Freedom Initiative (AFI), a New York-based human rights organization, Panahi's sentence is from a decade ago and according to Iranian law, the statute of limitations for the execution of his sentence has expired. But the Iranian judiciary refused to review his case and let him free, AFI reported.  Norway police ban Quran burning protest after Turkey summons Oslo envoy Norwegian police on Thursday banned a planned anti-Islam protest including the burning of a copy of the Quran for security reasons, hours after the Turkish foreign ministry summoned Norway's ambassador to complain, Reuters reported. ""Burning the Quran remains a legal way to express political views in Norway. But this event cannot be carried out for security reasons,"" Oslo police said in a statement, citing intelligence it had received. Background: A group of protesters planned to burn a copy of the Quran outside the Turkish embassy in Oslo on Friday, police said, echoing similar demonstrations last month in Sweden and Denmark. Earlier on Thursday, Ankara strongly condemned the anti-Islam group's plans, which it said was a ""provocative act,"" a source from the Turkish foreign ministry said, adding that the ministry had asked for the demonstration to be called off. The police can only ban a demonstration if there is a danger to the public. Why it matters: A protest including burning a copy of Quran last month near the Turkish embassy in Stockholm by an anti-immigrant Danish-Swedish politician from the far-right fringe drew strong condemnation from Ankara. Sweden and Finland applied last year to join NATO after Russia invaded Ukraine, but faced unexpected objections from Turkey and have since sought to win its support.

A Saudi television channel has found itself under fire after a reality show featured scenes of young male contestants acting affectionately with each other.   An Arabic hashtag calling for the closure of Al Waqie TV went viral on Twitter after the scenes were broadcast on the reality series ""The Business,"" which follows 40 young Saudi men living in one house and competing for a cash prize. Inspired by the American reality TV show ""Big Brother,"" viewers can vote for and eliminate contestants online.  Homosexuality is illegal in Saudi Arabia and the government has of late cracked down on LGBTQ symbols and banned Hollywood films that show same-sex couples. In the clips that caused the controversy, some contestants are seen embracing and showing signs of affection. One Twitter user wrote: ""It's very sad and dangerous that the ideas of satanic organizations reach children's programs.""  ""Frankly, I saw clips and was shocked, even if we take them for good faith and intention. You are on a program in front of women and young viewers, you must be disciplined and with limits. You don't take the situation lightly,"" tweeted another user.   But not everyone had the same opinion, some Twitter users defended the men and said their actions were misunderstood.   One user wrote: ""By God, you are strange people,"" referring to critics of the show. ""Now someone hugging their friend and showing affection is a crime.""   Another account used the hashtag to promote the pro-LGBTQ phrase ""love is love.""  Several Twitter users in Saudi Arabia called on the authorities to shut down the TV channel and the program.   The show, which is in its second season, has around 41 million views on YouTube, the channel said on its Instagram account.  The channel didn't respond to CNN's requests for comment.

His corner stand at the heart of Ramallah is always busy, no matter the weather, but his future as a Palestinian is very much as gloomy as the skies above. ""I am 40 years old and I keep seeing the same thing. Many leaderships have come and gone and the situation remains the same,"" he says. Despite US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas just a few hilly kilometers away on Tuesday, A'asem says he is sure Palestinians are not a priority for Washington.  ""His visit is only intended for Israel,"" he says. ""It's just good manners to pass by since he is in the neighborhood.""Blinken's visit came in a month that has seen the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli security forces at an eight-year-high. Ten of those deaths occurred because of a raid by Israeli forces in Jenin on Thursday. Tensions quickly spiraled and the next day, a Palestinian man shot and killed seven Israelis outside a synagogue.

He also said the US, specifically the Biden administration, remains committed to a two-state solution.Speaking alongside Abbas in Ramallah, Blinken said it was necessary first ""to take steps to de-escalate, to stop the violence, to reduce tensions, and to try as well to create the foundation for more positive actions going forward.""But that, he said, was ""not sufficient"" by itself. ""It's also important to continue to strive not only for reducing violence but ensuring that ultimately Israelis and Palestinians alike enjoy the same rights, the same opportunities. What we're seeing now from Palestinians is a shrinking horizon of hope, not an expanding one, and that, too, we believe needs to change.""US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas clasp hands in Ramallah on Tuesday, January 31, 2023.Yet A'asem is not putting his faith in the United States' top diplomat.""He might offer us something here and there but it's all empty promises,"" he says.

Down the road, the smell of cashews and almonds being roasted at Rifa'at Yousuf's shop cuts through the cold winter air. He too is not optimistic. ""It's gone from bad to worse,"" Yousuf, 44, says of US policy towards Palestinians. ""(Blinken's) visit is not welcome for us Palestinians,"" he adds, accusing the secretary of state of enabling Israeli occupation and supporting what he says are Israel's violent actions in the occupied West Bank.

""When effectively the Arab-Israeli conflict (comes) to an end, I think we'll circle back to the Palestinians and get a workable peace with the Palestinians,"" he said.Asked what concessions Israel would grant Palestinian territories, Netanyahu responded: ""Well, I'm certainly willing to have them have all the powers that they need to govern themselves.

""We are very upset,"" 18-year-old Nihad Omar says. ""Every day we see someone become a martyr or a prisoner, it's the same cycle and the numbers just keep increasing, they are not going down.""Analysts on both sides say the Israeli government's promises that it will respond to violence with an ""iron fist,"" coupled with the despair felt by many in Gaza and the West Bank, have turned the region into a powder keg with an ever-shortening fuse. Echoing that feeling, Omar says there's only so much pressure Palestinians can and are willing to bear.""The occupation is surrounding us from all over and not letting the Palestinian people breathe,"" he says. Hanan Ashwari, a Palestinian rights advocate and former member of the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization, says the frustration with the United States and Israel felt by those CNN spoke with is valid, and very much widespread through Ramallah and the West Bank. ""(Blinken) wants to integrate Israel in the region, which means, you know, sideline the Palestinians, reward Israel and normalize the occupation,"" Ashwari says. ""Then they talk about being in favor of two-state solution, they pat themselves on the shoulder and they go home.""That's very ironic, because they stood aside and they allowed Israel to destroy the two-state solution by destroying the Palestinian state, stealing land, killing people, demolishing homes, and terrorizing, through settlers and the army, the Palestinians,"" she adds. The disillusionment, Ashwari says, is not just with the United States, but also with the current Palestinian leadership. ""We have had a leadership that is not just rhetoric but has held on to positions of power and has failed in many ways to deliver to the people even its own policies,"" she explains. ""I think it is time to have elections and to have a new leadership chosen by the people enjoying the legitimacy of the election.""Mourners take part in the funeral of Palestinians who were killed in an Israeli raid in Jenin, in the occupied West Bank, on January 26, 2023.Most we spoke with in Ramallah agree. ""The Palestinian leadership tries to appease the Palestinian people and bring good, but they are handicapped and incapable of delivering,"" Omar says. ""The people who are around [current Palestinian Authority President] Mahmoud Abbas are unfortunately more cooperative with the Israelis than him,"" Yousuf says. ""I wish we had someone with the spirit Yasser Arafat had.""But some do still give Abbas and his leadership some credit. ""The Palestinian leadership tries to bring solutions for the Palestinian people, but they face many challenges,"" coffee-stand owner A'asem says. Those challenges to a more prosperous Palestinian future, including the establishment of a Palestinian state, they say are roadblocks purposefully put in place by Israeli politicians. For Ashwari, Israeli policies towards Palestinians, now enacted by what is the most right-wing government in the country's history, are slowly but surely destroying the viability of a two-state solution. ""Israel is making sure there is no viable sovereign Palestinian state by expanding settlements, stealing more land,"" Ashwari says. ""This is unacceptable. The more settlements you build, the less land you have for the Palestinians.""On the streets of Ramallah, Palestinians are acutely aware of that reality. ""We hope for a two-state solution but what we see on the horizon and what we see on the ground there is nothing to indicate a two-state solution [is viable],"" Yousuf says. ""Palestinians don't have power or opinion or choice, the two-state solution is only words, we aspire for a two-state solution, but this is becoming a dream, an unrealistic dream.""""There won't be a two-state solution,"" Omar agrees. ""With the Israeli occupiers never.""As he brews another pot of coffee, a pensive A'asem realises the dream of a Palestinian state doesn't seem to be getting any closer. ""Maybe the two state (solution) has become an unrealistic dream,"" he concedes, seemingly heartbroken by the acknowledgment.But that sense of defeat is only a momentary lapse before a fiery comeback. ""We Palestinians, we are an emotional people, we are generous, and we will be generous to the Jewish people when they come as guests,"" he says. ""But with an occupier there will never be peace.""

""Two soldiers came up to me, told me to get up, one told me, 'Leave your daughter with her mother,' and then he took me and cuffed my hands behind my back.""Al-Hayja's traumatic run-in with Israeli security forces happened as they carried out what they described as a counterterrorism operation in the center of the Jenin refugee camp on January 26.

(CNN)It was a trajectory -- Washington to Cairo, and then Jerusalem -- similar to the one made nearly a half century earlier by a predecessor of Antony Blinken.Starting in 1974, then-Secretary of State Henry Kissinger's ""shuttle diplomacy"" would bring an accord of sorts and a degree of stability to the region following the catastrophic and bloody Yom Kippur War between Israel and its Arab neighbors. David A. Andelman But it would bring little real, lasting peace.Today, 49 years later, there is still no Palestinian state, relations between Israelis and their Palestinian neighbors are as fraught as ever, blood runs in the streets of both places, and the most obdurate, certainly the most right-wing government in Israeli history has just taken power in Jerusalem. Read MoreOn Tuesday, Blinken wound up three days of meetings with Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. And in the end, it seems, all sides seemed quite content to stand on some long-entrenched and hardly softening positions.As Blinken was winging his way home, Netanyahu told CNN's Jake Tapper in an exclusive interview on Tuesday, ""For 25 years, the Palestinians who don't want peace with Israel, want to see a peace without Israel, who don't want a state next to Israel, but a state instead of Israel --  they had an effective veto on Israel's expansion of the circle of peace around it."" Netanyahu insisted that he wants negotiations with the Palestinians, which the Palestinians don't want. The prime minister also told CNN he believed his priority of cementing amicable arrangements with all Arab nations, as the Abraham Accords provided, would eventually drive the Palestinians to the peace table, effectively on his terms. 'It's all empty promises': Palestinians feel betrayed by US, warn there's only so much they can bear ""If we make peace with Saudi Arabia, [which] depends on the Saudi leadership, and bring effectively the Arab-Israeli conflict to an end, I think we'll circle back to the Palestinians and get a workable peace with the Palestinians. I think that's possible,"" Netanyahu told Tapper. By contrast, Abbas emerged from his meeting with Blinken and asserted, ""the Israeli Government is responsible for what's happening these days, because of its practices that undermine the two-state solution and violate the signed agreements, and because of the lack of international efforts to dismantle the occupation and the settlement regimes, and the failure to recognize the Palestinian state and its full membership in the United Nations.""Throughout his visit, and especially at its end, Blinken was most careful to treat Palestinians and Israelis even-handedly, promising America's ""support [for] all efforts to move us closer to peace, expand the horizon of hope, advance equal rights and opportunities for Palestinians and Israelis.""   But he was quite clear on the profound challenges in all three cities he'd visited where ""I heard a deep concern about the current trajectory."" And he was equally clear that America continues to support a two-state solution -- independent states of Israelis and Palestinians -- a concept that Palestinians believe is not shared by the Netanyahu government . ""Restoring calm is our immediate task, but over the longer term we have to do more than just lower tensions,"" Blinken explained. ""It's President Biden's firm conviction that the only way to achieve that goal is through preserving and then realizing the vision of two states for two peoples. The United States will continue to oppose anything that puts that goal further from reach, including but not limited to settlement expansion, legalization of illegal outposts, a move towards annexation of the West Bank, disruption to the historic status quo on Jerusalem's holy sites, demolitions and evictions, and incitement and acquiescence to violence.""Quite a heavy lift considering what Netanyahu told Tapper.Netanyahu outlines vision for two-state solution -- without Palestinian sovereignty   Indeed, it would seem that the government Netanyahu leads is determined to press forward on initiatives only calculated to inflame passions on both sides. His public security minister, Itamar Ben Gvir, has been convicted for inciting anti-Arab racism. While Aryeh Deri, leader of the ultra-Orthodox Sephardi party Shas, was forced to step down as interior minister by the nation's high court, he is expected to return after Netanyahu's ruling coalition pledged its support.At the same time, the right-wing dominated Knesset awarded to Bezalel Smotrich -- a religious-Zionist leader of the settler movement -- supervision of the Jewish territories that Palestinians have long claimed for themselves. Passions continued to rise, as an Israeli army raid on the Jenin refugee camp last week left 10 Palestinians dead and was followed by an attack by a Palestinian gunman on a Jerusalem synagogue that left seven dead. In the past week at least 22 people have been killed in violent incidents.  Amid such a tense atmosphere it seems unlikely that some key Middle East nations, particularly Saudi Arabia, will have any incentive to establish a working relationship with Israel that could lead to a lasting peace. At Davos, before the latest deadly confrontations between Israelis and Palestinians, Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud told the World Economic Forum, ""Palestine remains an important evocative issue in our region... the focus really needs to be on a pathway to resolving this conflict."" Netanyahu clearly has staked out consistent priorities that could make any such accommodation unlikely. ""Israel should have the overriding security responsibility [for Israeli territories] because every time we moved out, say from Lebanon, basically Iran came in with its proxy Hezbollah,"" he told CNN. ""We moved out of Gaza and other radical Islamists, Hamas, took over. And if we just walk away as people suggest, then you'll have Hamas and Iran move into the hills around Jerusalem, overlooking Tel Aviv.""

But if the overarching purpose of Blinken's visit was to engage with the government of Netanyahu -- who has had a longstanding, sometimes fraught relationship with President Biden -- without burning any new bridges, then the Secretary of State may have left in the nick of time.  In April, as they often do, Ramadan and Passover will overlap. A recipe for another round of a conflict that is little closer to resolution. Still, as Netanyahu pointed out to Tapper, and negotiators harking back to Kissinger have recognized, deeply flawed though Israel may be, it is the only working democracy in the Middle East.  The US has little alternative, then, to support it and do its best to hold up a mirror to its faults, praying it will do the right thing for all who live within its borders and abroad.

13," (CNN)The Republican-led House of Representatives voted on Thursday to pass a resolution to remove Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar from the powerful House Foreign Affairs Committee. House Republicans have argued Omar should not serve on the committee in light of past statements she has made related to Israel that in some cases been criticized by members of both parties as antisemitic. Democrats have criticized the push to oust Omar, arguing it amounts to an act of political revenge and that the Minnesota Democrat has been held accountable for her past remarks. The party-line vote was 218 to 211. GOP Rep. David Joyce of Ohio voted ""present.""Omar was defiant in a floor speech ahead of the vote. ""My leadership and voice will not be diminished if I am not on this committee for one term. My voice will get louder and stronger,"" she said. ""So take your vote or not -- I am here to stay, and I am here to be a voice against harms around the world and advocate for a better world,"" the congresswoman said. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries accused Republicans of seeking ""political revenge.""Read More""I will move immediately to seat Rep. Omar on the House Budget Committee where she will defend Democratic values against right-wing extremism,"" Jeffries tweeted after the House vote.The action by House Republicans comes after House Speaker Kevin McCarthy officially denied seats on the House Intelligence Committee to Democratic Reps. Eric Swalwell and Adam Schiff, the former chairman of the panel -- a decision that was condemned by Democrats. McCarthy vowed last year that if Republicans won back the House majority, he would strip Schiff, Swalwell and Omar of committee assignments, arguing that Democrats created a ""new standard"" when they held the majority by removing Republican Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Paul Gosar of Arizona from committees for violent rhetoric and posts.House Republicans, now in the majority, have given Greene and Gosar committee assignments for the new Congress.Rep. Ilhan Omar leaves her office at the Longworth House Office Building on February 2 in Washington.In 2019, Omar issued a public apology after she faced a backlash for tweets condemned on both sides of the aisle. The apology came after the Minnesota Democrat faced widespread criticism after suggesting Republican support of Israel is fueled by donations from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), a prominent pro-Israel group. There have been other incidents as well: In 2021, a group of Jewish House Democrats accused Omar of equating the US and Israel with the Taliban and Hamas, the Palestinian militant group designated as a terrorist organization by the US. In response, Omar said that she was ""in no way equating terrorist organizations with democratic countries.""Greene and Gosar, who will now have committee assignments, have also faced criticism from both sides of the aisle. Last year, Republican leaders in Congress condemned both lawmakers for speaking at a White nationalist conference. Greene spoke at the America First Political Action Conference in Orlando, Florida -- an event founded by the far-right activist Nick Fuentes as an alternative to the annual Conservative Political Action Conference. Gosar appeared at the America First Political Action Conference via a pre-recorded video, HuffPost reported. Gosar also attended the same conference last year.Greene defended her appearance in a lengthy statement, dismissing the blowback as ""fake divisions and disingenuous allegations"" and proclaiming that she won't ""cancel"" other conservatives even if she finds their statements ""tasteless, misguided or even repulsive at times.""A CNN KFile review of Gosar's events and social media posts over the years found that the lawmaker has long associations with White nationalists, a pro-Nazi blogger and far-right fringe players. A spokesperson for Gosar declined to comment on specific questions about the congressman's associates in response to the reporting.In 2021, Greene apologized for her ""offensive"" comments comparing Capitol Hill mask-wearing rules to the Holocaust after visiting the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington.Omar, Schiff and Swalwell have pushed back in reaction to McCarthy's effort to strip them of committee seats. ""Kevin McCarthy's purely partisan moves to strip us from our committee is not only a political stunt, but also a blow to the integrity of our democratic institution and threat to our national security,"" Omar said at a recent press conference where she spoke alongside Schiff and Swalwell. Democrats had also argued the move is hypocritical by pointing to the fact that embattled GOP Rep. George Santos, who is facing mounting legal issues and growing calls to resign for extensively lying about his resume and identity, had been awarded seats on two committees. In an abrupt change in course, however, Santos told the House GOP conference on Tuesday behind closed doors that he wants off of his two committees until his issues are resolved, three members told CNN.McCarthy has the power to unilaterally block Schiff and Swalwell from serving on the House Intelligence Committee because it is a select committee. Ousting Omar, however, from the House Foreign Affairs Committee required a vote of the full House of Representatives. McCarthy told CNN Tuesday evening that he had the votes to oust Omar. The assertion came after House GOP leaders worked to lock down the votes after several members of their conference had signaled resistance to the move.One of those Republicans, Rep. Victoria Spartz of Indiana, announced on Tuesday that she is now prepared to support a resolution to oust Omar, citing the addition of ""due process language.""""I appreciate Speaker McCarthy's willingness to address legitimate concerns and add due process language to our resolution. Deliberation and debate are vital for our institution, not top-down approaches,"" the congresswoman said in a statement.Spartz had previously indicated that she opposed the effort to remove the three Democratic lawmakers from committees.Last week, Spartz put out a statement that referenced how Democrats had kicked Greene and Gosar off committees. ""Two wrongs do not make a right. Speaker Pelosi took unprecedented actions last Congress to remove Reps. Greene and Gosar from their committees without proper due process. Speaker McCarthy is taking unprecedented actions this Congress to deny some committee assignments to the Minority without proper due process again,"" the congresswoman said at the time.The Democrat-led House voted in 2021 to remove Greene from committee assignments in the wake of unearthed incendiary and violent past statements, including a report from CNN's KFile that she repeatedly indicated support for executing prominent Democratic politicians in 2018 and 2019 before being elected to Congress. Eleven House Republicans joined with Democrats at the time in support of the move.The Democrat-led House also voted that year to approve a resolution that censured Gosar and stripped him of committee assignments in a rebuke to the Arizona Republican for posting a photoshopped anime video to social media showing him appearing to kill Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and attacking President Joe Biden. Two House Republicans voted with Democrats at the time to pass the resolution.This story and headline have been updated with additional developments Thursday.CNN's Nicky Robertson, Morgan Rimmer, Melanie Zanona and Veronica Stracqualursi contributed to this report.

16," (CNN)People who struggle with chronic constipation have a new drug-free option to help get things moving again.  It's a first-of-its-kind capsule about is the size of a regular pill -- but instead of releasing medication after it's swallowed, it vibrates to stimulate the colon.  The capsules, called Vibrant, was cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration in August but just became available for doctors to prescribe this week.Why does coffee make you poop? Experts explainDoctors consider a person to be constipated when they're having fewer than three bowel movements in a week. Between 10% to 20% of Americans live with persistent constipation that doesn't have a discernible cause, according to a recent survey. They tend to have hard, dry stools that may cause pain and bloating.  The idea behind the treatment is that a single vibrant pill is taken around bedtime every day. It then travels the same route as food does, through the stomach and small intestine, finally reaching the large intestine about 14 hours later. Then, it goes to work. Read MoreThe pills stimulate specialized nerve cells in the gut called mechanosensory cells. These help trigger peristalsis, the undulating muscle contractions that help squeeze food through the gut.""There are little vibrations for three seconds on, three seconds off,"" said Cathy Collis, chief commercial officer for Vibrant Gastro, which is based in Israel but has offices in the US.  Before use, each pill is activated in a little pod that turns it on.  After it's swallowed, it is active for about two hours, goes quiet for around six hours and then activates again for another two hours.  Finally, after they've done their job, the person's body poops them out, and they're flushed away.  Not just prunes: foods to help you get regularThe capsules are not a cure. They're designed to be taken daily, the same way you would take other maintenance treatments.According to the company, the capsules are made of a medical-grade material also used for the pill cameras that gastroenterologists have used for the past 15 years.  To get FDA clearance, Vibrant had to demonstrate that there were no toxic materials in the pills and that they could withstand, for example, the force of a bite in case someone accidentally bit them.The company also had to show that the capsules didn't pose certain risks, such as causing infections, irritating tissues, interfering with other electronic devices, getting stuck or not working at all.Like contact lenses and syringes, the FDA considers them to be class 2 medical devices, meaning they carry intermediate risk to of harm to the user.Once the pills make their way into sewage, they are sifted out and taken to a landfill as non-compostable material.Fewer side effectsIn a small clinical trial, 349 people with chronic constipation were divided into two groups: 200 who took the vibrating capsules every day for eight weeks and 149 who swallowed a lookalike pill that didn't vibrate.The people who took the Vibrant pills reported being able to go more often and to empty their bowels more completely compared with those who didn't get the active capsules. About 40% of the group taking the Vibrant pills reported having at least one additional bowel movement a week, compared with about 23% of the placebo group. They also reported softer stools and less bloating.  The percentage of patients who reported two or more additional bowel movements each week was 23% in the group that took the Vibrant pills and about 12% in the group taking the placebo.Health effects of probiotics: Where do we stand?Most people said they couldn't feel the pills working, but some did.""A minority could feel it,"" said Dr. Eamonn Quigley, chief of gastroenterology at Houston Methodist Hospital. Quigley helped test the capsules, but he doesn't have any financial stake in the company. ""None of them felt it was being uncomfortable. And none of them stopped taking it because of that.""He says he can't directly compare the effectiveness of the Vibrant capsules to other kinds of remedies because they weren't tested head-to-head in the study.  But he says the degree of relief with the Vibrant capsules appears to be similar to how prescription drugs for constipation performed in their clinical trials.People who took the Vibrant capsules reported no serious adverse events, like bowel obstructions. More digestive side effects were reported in the placebo group than in the Vibrant group: 9.4% vs. 6.5%, respectively. Two people who took the Vibrant capsules reported diarrhea, but it wasn't common.""One of the important side effects that it does not have is diarrhea, as a lot of the prescription drugs can lead to diarrhea,"" Quigley noted.Common myths about bloating, deflatedThat's because most prescription constipation drugs work in the small intestine, where they release more fluid and secretions into digesting food.  Dr. Satish Rao, distinguished chair of gastroenterology at Augusta University's School of Medicine, says there's no question that prescription medications for constipation work, but they target a different area than the vibrating pill. ""If you just think about it from a mechanistic perspective, they are working a little away from where the problem is, but they are helping the problem,"" said Rao, who also helped test the capsules.By contrast, the Vibrant capsules work in the colon, which is the source of the trouble, he says.Stimulating the gut without drugsThe vibrating capsules are programmed to work in a specific way, and they're FDA-authorized only to treat chronic constipation in adults who haven't gotten help from or who can't tolerate side effects of over-the-counter or prescription medications.People who have trouble swallowing or who have paralysis of their stomach, called gastroparesis, should not take Vibrant pills, Collis said. They're also not a good idea for people who have a history of bowel obstructions.But Rao thinks that with more study and fine-tuning, experts might be able to reprogram the pills so they would go to work earlier, perhaps in the stomach, potentially to help people with gastroparesis.Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.He thinks it might also be possible down the road to personalize the programming of the capsule to better address the needs of individual patients.Vibrant is not currently covered by insurance, Collis says. For those who have health insurance, the company is offering a coupon to cap out-of-pocket costs at $69 per month. They're not a cure; people need to take them consistently to see relief.""We are working right now with insurance companies to obtain coverage in commercial plans,"" she said. ""But until we get that coverage, our goal and commitment is to make sure that this is accessible and affordable to patients.""",Drug-free relief from chronic constipation may came from a new vibrating pill,CNN,2023-02-08T11:32:01Z,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/08/health/vibrating-pills-constipation-wellness/index.html

The increase in crypto heists, from $3.3 billion in 2021, came as the overall market for cryptocurrencies suffered significant declines. Some of the biggest thefts were driven by North Korean-linked hackers, blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis said in the report.

18," (CNN)Thousands of people have died and tens of thousands of others were injured by the devastating earthquakes that rocked Turkey and Syria on Monday.Rescue teams are still desperately searching for signs of life beneath the rubble of collapsed buildings amid grim conditions, but days on from the massive tremblor, the chances of finding survivors lessen with every passing hour.Here's what we know about the quake and why it was so deadly.Where did the earthquake hit?One of the most powerful earthquakes to hit the region in a century rocked residents from their slumber in the early hours of Monday morning around 4 a.m. The 7.8 magnitude quake struck 23 kilometers (14.2 miles) east of Nurdagi, in Turkey's Gaziantep province, at a depth of 24.1 kilometers (14.9 miles), the United States Geological Survey (USGS) said.Read MoreA series of aftershocks reverberated through the region in the immediate hours after the initial incident. A magnitude 6.7 aftershock followed 11 minutes after the first quake hit, but the largest temblor, which measured 7.5 in magnitude, struck about nine hours later. More than 125 aftershocks have been recorded so far.Rescuers are now racing against time and the elements to pull survivors out from under debris on both sides of the border. More than 5,700 buildings in Turkey have collapsed, according to the country's disaster agency. Monday's quake was also one of the strongest that Turkey has experienced in the last century -- a 7.8 magnitude quake hit the east of the country in 1939, which resulted in more than 30,000 deaths, according to the USGS.Why was this one so deadly? A number of factors have contributed to making this earthquake so lethal. One of them is the time of day it occurred. With the quake hitting early in the morning, many people were in their beds when it happened, and are now trapped under the rubble of their homes. Additionally, with a cold and wet weather system moving through the region, poor conditions have made reaching affected areas trickier, and rescue and recovery efforts on both sides of the border significantly more challenging once teams have arrived. Temperatures have been bitterly low, plummeting several degrees below zero on several occasions. With scattered showers and snow in the region set to continue, the elements are putting the lives of those trapped underneath the rubble -- who have already gone days without food and water -- at risk of hypothermia. Meanwhile, officials have asked residents to leave buildings for their own safety amid concerns of more aftershocks.

More than 5,700 buildings in Turkey have collapsed, according to the country's disaster agency, and questions have been asked about the integrity of structures in some areas of the affected regions.""The thing that strikes mostly are the type of collapses -- what we call the pancake collapse -- which is the type of collapse that we engineers don't like to see,"" said Mustafa Erdik, a professor of earthquake engineering at Bogazici University in Istanbul. ""In such collapses, it's difficult -- as you can see -- and a very tragic to save lives. It makes the operation of the search and rescue teams very difficult.""Erdik told CNN the images of widespread destruction and debris indicates ""that there are highly variable qualities of designs and construction."" He says the type of structural failures following an earthquake are usually partial collapses. ""Total collapses are something you always try to avoid both in codes and the actual design,"" he added.  USGS structural engineer Kishor Jaiswal told CNN Tuesday that Turkey has experienced significant earthquakes in the past, including a quake in 1999 which hit southwest Turkey and killed more than 14,000 people. Because of this, he said, many parts of Turkey have regional building regulations to ensure construction projects can withstand these types of events. JUST WATCHEDVideo shows trapped child comfort sibling under rubbleReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHVideo shows trapped child comfort sibling under rubble 04:11But not all buildings have been built according to the modern Turkish seismic standard, Jaiswal said. Deficiencies in the design and construction, especially in older buildings, mean that many buildings could not withstand the severity of the shocks.""If you are not designing these structures for the seismic intensity that they may face in their design life, these structures may not perform well,"" said Jaiswal.Erdik also said he believed many of the buildings that have collapsed were likely ""built pre-1999 or ... with older codes.""  He added there also would have been instances where some buildings didn't conform to code. Survivors are still being pulled from the rubble more than 24 hours after Turkey earthquake""The codes are very modern in Turkey, very similar to US codes, but again, the codes conformity is an issue that we've tried to tackle with legal and administrative procedures."" he explained. ""We have the permits from municipalities and controls for design, controls for construction. But then again, there are things that are lacking."" How long can people survive under rubble?Despite the mounting challenges, a structural engineer and humanitarian coordinator urged rescuers not to abandon hope as survivors could be found up to ""weeks"" after the massive earthquake hit the region. Kit Miyamoto, president of non-profit Miyamoto Global Disaster Relief, also praised the community in Turkey who came together and ""did their part"" after the quake struck. ""The community, the citizens, they're the ones that are actually the first line of defense,"" he told CNN Wednesday. ""They dug up family, friends, neighbors."" But other experts warn that the window for post-earthquake search-and-rescue is rapidly closing. Ilan Kelman, professor of disasters and health at University College London, said: ""Typically, few survivors are pulled out after 72 hours -- yet every life saved is essential and some people are extricated after many days.""He added: ""Time is always the enemy, as seen in Turkey and Syria. People die due to immediate medical needs such as bleeding to death or succumbing to crush injuries; due to aftershocks that collapse precarious structures with people underneath; and due to the weather which has dropped below freezing at night and which has been cold during the day, so people die through hypothermia. Many die from lacking food and water while awaiting rescue.""Why do earthquakes happen?Earthquakes occur on every continent in the world -- from the highest peaks in the Himalayan Mountains to the lowest valleys, like the Dead Sea, to the bitterly cold regions of Antarctica. However, the distribution of these quakes is not random.The USGS describes an earthquake as ""the ground shaking caused by a sudden slip on a fault. Stresses in the earth's outer layer push the sides of the fault together. Stress builds up and the rocks slip suddenly, releasing energy in waves that travel through the earth's crust and cause the shaking that we feel during an earthquake.""Earthquakes are measured using seismographs, which monitor the seismic waves that travel through the Earth after a quake.Many may recognize the term ""Richter Scale"" which scientists previously used for many years, but these days they generally follow the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale (MMI), which is a more accurate measure of a quake's size, according to the USGS.How big is a 7.8 earthquake? The power of an earthquake is known as magnitude. The intensity of the shaking can vary depending on the local geography and topography, and depth of the quake. On the magnitude scale, each increase of one whole number translates to 32 times more energy. On this occasion, shaking from the 7.8 magnitude earthquake in southern Turkey could be felt as far as Israel and Lebanon, hundreds of kilometers away. Turkey is no stranger to strong earthquakes, as it is situated along tectonic plate boundaries. Seven quakes with magnitude 7.0 or greater have struck the country in the past 25 years -- but Monday's was one of the most powerful. It is also the strongest quake to hit anywhere in the world since an 8.1 magnitude quake struck a region near the South Sandwich Islands in the southern Atlantic Ocean in 2021, though the remote location of that incident resulted in little damage. 

Why are there so many earthquakes in Turkey?CNN's meteorologist and severe weather expert Chad Myers said, ""we always talk about the epicenter, but in this case we should talk about the epi-line.""Two massive tectonic plates -- the Arabian and the Eurasian -- meet underneath Turkey's southeastern provinces. Along this fault line, ""about 100 miles from one side to the other, the earth slipped,"" Myers continued. Seismologists refer to this event as a ""strike slip"" -- ""where the plates are touching, and all of a sudden they slide sideways,"" Myers said.This is unlike the Ring of Fire, which runs along the west coast of the United States. In this zone, earthquakes and tsunamis are often caused by subduction -- where one plate slides below another.But in a ""strike slip,"" the plates move horizontally, rather than vertically. ""Why that matters is because the buildings don't want to go back and forth. And then the secondary waves begin to go back and forth as well,"" Myers added.Because of the nature of this seismic event, aftershocks could last ""for weeks and months,"" according to CNN meteorologist Karen Maginnis.How does this quake compare globally?In comparison with other large earthquakes around the world, the 2011 Japan quake and tsunami -- in which more than 22,000 people were killed or went missing -- registered a magnitude of 9.1. How to help victims of the earthquake in Turkey and SyriaThat incident left widespread destruction in its wake after walls of water engulfed entire towns, dragged houses onto highways and caused the country's worst nuclear disaster on record. A year before, in 2010, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake in Haiti is estimated to have killed between 220,000 to 300,000. A further 300,000 people were injured, and millions were displaced. In 2004, an earthquake with an estimated magnitude of 9.1 struck the coast of Sumatra, Indonesia, causing a tsunami that left 227,898 people dead or listed as missing and presumed dead.The strongest earthquake on record was a magnitude 9.5 in Chile in 1960, according to the USGS. 


",Explainer: The earthquake in Turkey is one of the deadliest this century. Here's why,CNN,2023-02-07T17:45:00Z,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/07/middleeast/earthquake-turkey-syria-why-deadly-intl/index.html
19,"A version of this story appears in today's Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, CNN's three-times-a-week look inside the region's biggest stories. Sign up here.Abu Dhabi (CNN)Syrian victims of the devastating earthquake that hit their country and Turkey on Monday may become hostages of the politics that have divided Syria for over a decade, analysts have warned. The 7.8 magnitude earthquake, which struck southern Turkey in the early hours of Monday, was followed by more than 100 aftershocks and a second 7.5 magnitude earthquake. More than 11,000 have been killed across Syria and Turkey, and hundreds more are feared trapped under the rubble. While Turkey has received an outpouring of support and aid from dozens of countries, outreach to Syria has been less enthusiastic, raising concerns that victims on one side of the Turkish-Syrian border may be neglected while others are provided for. ""Syrians must not be forgotten,"" Aya Majzoub, Amnesty International's deputy regional director for the Middle East and North Africa, told CNN. ""Often, those who suffer the worst during such disasters are those who were already vulnerable."" Observers say politics is to blame. Read MoreTurkey is a NATO member whose international stature has only grown in recent years. Syria, on the other hand, is ruled by a myriad of disparate groups. Its regime, internationally sidelined and heavily sanctioned due to its brutal suppression of an uprising there that started in 2011, counts Iran and Russia as its closest allies -- both global pariahs.  The Syrian regime is shunned by most Western countries. But leader Bashar al-Assad has begun forging ties with former enemies as regional states welcome him back into the fold. Last year, the United Arab Emirates welcomed Assad in Abu Dhabi, and last month Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that the pair may soon meet for peace talks. For Syrians devastated by civil war, the earthquake aftermath is 'a crisis in a crisis'Some of the areas of Syria most impacted by the earthquake are controlled by the regime, others by Turkish-backed and US-backed opposition forces, Kurdish rebels and Sunni Islamist fighters. Idlib, one of Syria's last opposition strongholds, is controlled by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) organization, an armed Sunni Islamist group. ""It's still an active conflict zone, the Syrian crisis is far from over,"" said Charles Lister, senior fellow and director of the Syria and Countering Terrorism & Extremism program at the Middle East Institute in Washington, DC. ""The UN aid mission is a complicated set up."" Seventy countries and 14 international organizations have offered Turkey relief following the quake, Erdogan said on Tuesday, including the United States, the United Kingdom, the UAE, Israel and Russia. Workers unload aid sent by Iran at the airport in Syria's northern city of Aleppo early on February 8, 2023.Aid must go through Damascus The international aid situation in Syria is less clear. So far, the UAE, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Egypt, Algeria and India have already sent relief directly to regime-controlled airports. Others such as Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, China, Canada and the Vatican have pledged aid; however it is unclear if that relief will be sent directly to the regime. The regime insists that all aid to the country, including aid that is meant for areas outside its control, be directed to the capital Damascus. ""We are ready to work with all who want to provide Syria, from inside Syria, so access from inside Syria is there,"" Syria's representative to the UN, Bassam al-Sabbagh, told a news conference in New York on Monday. ""So, anyone who'd like to help Syria they can coordinate with the government and we will be ready to do so."" That hasn't been received well by activists and observers who fear that the regime could hamper timely aid to thousands of quake victims in rebel-held areas, most of whom are women and children, according to the UN.   ""The Assad regime has systematically siphoned off aid and/or blocked it from reaching non-regime areas (in the past),"" tweeted Mai El-Sadany, a Washington-based human rights lawyer and managing editor at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy. ""The international community must urgently find ways to ensure that emergency assistance and support reaches the people of northwest Syria.""

""There is likely to be less international assistance provided to opposition areas because that is additionally complicated,"" Lister told CNN. ""It's not an area controlled by a sovereign government and makes it difficult for aid operators."" Already, UN aid to the region has been disrupted due to damage inflicted on roads by the earthquake, the UN has said. The damaged Bab al-Hawa crossing is the only humanitarian aid corridor between Turkey and Syria.  ""We are exploring all avenues to reach people in need and conducting assessments on feasibility,"" Madevi Sun-Suon, a spokesperson for the  UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance (OCHA), told CNN on Tuesday. ""We do have aid but this road issue is a big challenge as of now."" The pain on the ground extends beyond the rubble.

Majzoub said residents of the northwest ""live in appalling conditions, with little access to adequate shelter, water, sanitation, and healthcare, due to the Syrian government's denial and obstruction of access to essential services."" The rebel-held region is also grappling with a harsh winter and deadly cholera outbreak.  ""They depend entirely on humanitarian aid facilitated by the UN cross-border mechanism from Turkey, which allows the UN and its partners to provide aid without the authorization of the Syrian government,"" she said. A man who evacuated his home warms up next to a fire in the aftermath of the earthquake, in Aleppo, Syria, February 8, 2023. Exploiting the earthquake The Syrian regime has also used the opportunity to call for sanctions against it to be lifted. Its UN envoy Sabbagh said on Tuesday that planes refused to land at Syrian airports because of American and European sanctions. ""So even those countries who want to send humanitarian assistance, they cannot use the airplane cargo because of the sanctions,"" he said in New York. The Damascus-based Syrian Arab Red Crescent made a similar appeal on Tuesday, adding that it was ready to deliver aid into rebel-held areas. In November, a UN-appointed human rights expert called for the immediate lifting of unilateral sanctions against Syria, saying they are exacerbating the destruction and trauma suffered by ordinary citizens there. The US has, however, ruled out changing its position on the regime.  ""It would be quite ironic, if not even counterproductive, for us to reach out to a government that has brutalized its people over the course of a dozen years now -- gassing them, slaughtering them, being responsible for much of the suffering that they have endured,"" US State Department spokesperson Ned Price told a media briefing on Monday. Some analysts agree that the regime could exploit the tragedy for its own benefit. ""It's a very convenient time for the regime to be making that argument because if sanctions were dropped, the ramifications of the much broader geopolitical situation would be game changing,"" said Lister. Additional reporting by CNN's Chris Liakos  The digest Iran reveals an underground air force base Iran on Tuesday revealed an underground air force base called ""Eagle 44,"" the first in the country large enough to house fighter jets, the official IRNA news said. The ""Eagle 44"" base is capable of storing and operating fighter jets and drones, IRNA said. The report did not elaborate on the location of the base. Background: In May, Iran's army gave details about another underground base, which houses drones, constructed as the country seeks to protect military assets from potential air strikes by regional arch foe Israel. Why it matters: The announcement comes less than 10 days after a drone attack on a military plant in Iran's central city of Isfahan that US media outlets attributed to Israel. IRNA said the new underground base was one of the country's most important air force bases, built deep underground, housing fighters equipped with long-range cruise missiles.  Swedish PM ready to restart talks with Turkey when Ankara is Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said on Tuesday he was ready to restart stalled negotiations over Sweden's application to join NATO as soon as Turkey was, Reuters reported. Background: Finland and Sweden sought NATO membership shortly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year, and while most member states have ratified the applications, Turkey has yet to give its approval in what must be a unanimous process. Turkey last week said it looks positively on Finland's application, but does not support Sweden's, even though the two Nordic neighbors are seeking to join at the same time. Why it matters: The three nations last year reached an agreement on a way forward, but Ankara suspended talks last month as tensions rose following protests in Stockholm, where a far-right politician burned a copy of the Quran. Turkey goes to elections in May.  Qatari, Bahraini foreign ministers discuss launching talks to end unresolved issues  Bahrain's foreign minister met with his Qatari counterpart in Saudi Arabia's capital Riyadh on Tuesday to discuss mechanisms to launch talks on unresolved issues between the two countries, Bahrain's state news agency reported. Background: Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt ended a three-year political and economic boycott of Qatar in January 2021. But since then there have been no bilateral discussions between Doha and Manama to resolve remaining differences. All but Bahrain restored travel and trade links in 2021. Why it matters: The move comes amid an apparent thaw in relations. Bahrain's crown prince spoke with Qatar's emir in a phone call last month, in a sign the two Gulf states could move towards repairing relations two years after the Arab boycott was lifted. The conversation came after the Qatari emir and Bahrain's king attended a small Arab summit hosted by the UAE's president in Abu Dhabi. What's trending Egypt and Saudi Arabia: #We_are_all_AlMosahf  Muslim Twitter users are fuming that a hugely popular Twitter account has been suspended.  AlMosahf (The Quran), an account that tweeted snippets from the Islamic holy book, had more than 13 million followers before Twitter took action against it. An Arabic hashtag showing solidarity with the account was trending in Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Many users saw it as an attempt to silence Muslims, and called on Twitter and its owner Elon Musk to reconsider the decision.  One user addressed Musk, saying: ""I don't think it violated the Twitter rules because its tweets are quoted from the Holy Quran. We demand the lifting of the suspension of this account."" Not all users were upset with the suspension. Some decried the account's use of incomplete Quranic verses that they said are taken out of context and thus change the meaning of the text. The account owner appears to run sister accounts in English, French and German, on which it posts translations of Quranic verses. Another sister account that shows Quranic videos has been campaigning for the original account to be unblocked. Twitter's communications account didn't respond to CNN's request for comment.

20," (CNN)As the US mulls over its future Covid-19 vaccination plan, data from three large health care systems indicate that even though a small percentage of people under age 65 have gotten the new Covid-19 booster, people this age are not becoming severely ill and overwhelming hospitals.""Even if they're not getting boosted, young, healthy people are not getting super sick from this,"" said Dr. Mangala Narasimhan, a senior vice president at Northwell Health, the largest health care provider in New York state. ""We're not seeing it. It's not happening.""  The US Food and Drug Administration has proposed a framework for annual Covid vaccinations for all Americans over the age of 6 months, but at a meeting with its vaccine advisers last month, it did not come up with a concrete plan. Vaccine advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are scheduled to meet February 24 to discuss the future of the US Covid-19 vaccination program.  Uptake of the bivalent booster, which has been available since September, has been low. Nationally, only about 16% of the population has gotten it, and the rates are especially low for people under 65, according to CDC data. The virus threat is easing, but US hospitals are still as full as everNarasimhan and doctors at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City and Clalit Health Services, Israel's largest health care organization, say the relative mildness of current Covid strains, along with a degree of immunity from previous vaccinations and infections, are going a long way toward protecting healthy young people, even if they don't get the booster.  Read MoreDr. Ran Balicer, director of the Clalit Research Institute and chairman of Israel's Covid-19 National Expert Advisory Panel, noted that at earlier points in the pandemic -- for example, when the virulent Delta variant was raging -- it was ""not responsible"" to opt out of the vaccine.  ""I don't think that's the case anymore,"" he said. ""I think when you're under 65 and healthy, it's a much more complex question, and I think that's where individual risk assessment and personal preferences come into play.""  Since the new booster became available, about 12% of all Covid deaths in the US have been among people younger than 65, according to CDC data.   A report released by the CDC on Thursday analyzed death rates and vaccination status from September through December. It showed that people who were vaccinated -- either with only the original vaccine or with an updated booster in addition -- were better protected than those who were unvaccinated.  The updated booster helps protect against both the original strain of the coronavirus and more recent Omicron strains. It was particularly effective at reducing death rates in older people and less effective for younger people. For adults younger than 65, the bivalent booster offered at least three times better protection from death than just the original vaccine -- but the difference in death rates was less than one in a million. FDA vaccine advisers vote to harmonize Covid-19 vaccines in the United StatesThe CDC recommends the updated booster to everyone over age 6 months, but a government advertising campaign focuses on the importance of the shot for people over 50.""We're not surprised, and we're grateful [and] happy to see that hospitals aren't filling up"" with people under age 65, said Dr. Ruth Link-Gelles, a CDC senior epidemiologist and lead author of several studies on the booster's effectiveness. ""But we still see occasionally healthy younger adults end up in the hospital. And to me, it's a no-brainer if I can take five minutes, pop into my local pharmacy and get a shot.""  ""There are people under 65 that are still dying of Covid, (and) any death in an unvaccinated or under-vaccinated person is potentially preventable had that person gotten the booster,"" she added.Link-Gelles said the CDC wants to avoid overly complicated guidelines for the new booster, with different suggestions for different age groups.  ""We generally across the board see higher uptake of vaccination with simpler vaccine recommendations,"" she said. ""That's one of the things we're trying to accomplish here.""  Data from three large health care systems  In October, as President Joe Biden rolled up his sleeve to get the new booster, he urged other Americans to do the same.  For people who are fully vaccinated, ""our nation's health experts recommend that they get the updated Covid vaccine once a year,"" Biden said at a White House briefing. ""Nearly every death is preventable [so] get your updated Covid shot.""  By and large, Americans haven't listened. While 41% of those over age 65 have received the booster, only 12% of those ages 5 to 64 have opted to get it, according to CDC data.   First on CNN: HHS secretary sends letter to state governors on what's to come when Covid-19 public health emergency endsData from the three large health care systems in New York and Israel since September 1 indicate that the low booster uptake for people under 65 has not led to high Covid hospitalization rates for this group.  At Northwell, about 1,224 patients under the age of 65 have been admitted with severe Covid-19 in that time period.  ""This is a large hospital system with [21] hospitals, so this is a small number in the big picture of Northwell,"" Narasimhan said.  Of the patients under 65 hospitalized with Covid, half had never received a Covid-19 vaccine shot of any kind, 42% had had one or two shots, and 7% had had three shots; 72% also had underlying health conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes or heart disease, according to an analysis done by Northwell for CNN.  At Montefiore Medical Center, about 300 patients under age 65 were hospitalized for Covid-19. Among those, 32% were unvaccinated, 10% were partially vaccinated, and 58% were fully vaccinated; 82% also had underlying conditions, according to Dr. Inessa Gendlina, an infectious disease expert and assistant professor at Einstein Montefiore Department of Medicine.FDA wants to simplify the use and updating of Covid-19 vaccinesAt Clalit, 1.2% of 4.5 million members under the age of 65 have opted to get the updated booster, according to Balicer. Covid hospitalization rates for that age group have been ""low"" since September: less than 5 per 100,000 people per month. In the US, Covid hospitalization rates are trending down, with an average of about 3,800 new admissions each day for people of all ages, less than 1,000 of which have been among people under age 60, as of the last week of January, according to the CDC. That data includes patients who were hospitalized for reasons unrelated to the virus but who tested positive while hospitalized, according to the agency.  The strength of the Northwell, Montefiore and Clalit data is that they're large systems that make a distinction between patients who were hospitalized specifically because of Covid and those who incidentally tested positive for Covid while in the hospital for a different reason.Experts disagree on boosting healthy young people  When the bivalent booster came out in September, Balicer, the chairman of Israel's Covid-19 National Expert Advisory Panel, did not get it.  ""I am not in any risk group, and I'm below 65, so I did not hurry to take my bivalent,"" said Balicer, who is in his late 40s and does not provide direct care to patients.  Despite recent widespread illness in US, Covid-19, flu and RSV are not a concern for most, survey findsHis reasoning was that if he didn't get the booster and came down with Covid, he probably would not get very sick given the relative mildness of the prevailing strain, some immunity from his three previous vaccinations and a bout with Covid last year. Also, he figured that if he did get the booster, it probably would not provide long-term protection from infection. ""Because I was vaccinated before, I know my risk of severe morbidity is very low"" even without the booster, he said. ""And I know that the protection from infection that I will get from the additional booster will be short-term -- a few months.""  But in late November, Balicer decided to get the shot because he had to travel abroad to attend ""long and important"" meetings, which involved several 12-hour flights and sitting with large groups of people in small rooms with little ventilation.  ""I did not want to risk becoming ill with Covid during that stay. I made a personal risk assessment"" to get the vaccine, even though he knew he might feel a bit sick the day after getting it, he said.  Some experts interviewed by CNN say that although the booster is important for elderly and for immune-compromised people, the decision whether to get it is somewhat murky for younger, healthy people.  Narasimhan, 51 and a pulmonary and critical care specialist at Northwell, said although there's data showing that the shot protects people over age 65 and those who are immune-compromised from dying or ending up in the hospital, ""young, healthy people don't necessarily need to get boosted.""  She said she and her young adult children got the booster because they live with a frail, elderly relative, and they want to do everything they can to decrease their chances of getting infected and passing it to him. But she said people in different situations might not make the same decision.  Dr. Nadav Davidovitch, 53, head of the School of Public Health at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel, said he got the booster and urged his family members to get it.  ""I told them it's a good idea. But when I'm talking to someone over 50 or who has chronic conditions, I'm pushing it more,"" he said. ""For young people, it's a matter of choice. There are different personalities and risk perceptions. I won't say it's a major mistake for a person who's 20-something not to get the booster.""  For young, healthy people, personal circumstances matter, he said.  Required vaccine coverage among kindergarteners drops for second year in a row""It's the context of who you're living with and visiting, so for example, maybe for health workers, it would be more important to get it,"" said Davidovitch, who chairs the Covid-19 Task Force at the Association of Public Health Schools in the European Region.Data shows that the booster provides ""a modest degree of protection"" against symptomatic Covid compared to those who'd been previously vaccinated, and ""it's likely that increased vaccination among all or most people helps slow the spread of disease and reduce the chances they infect someone at high risk of severe disease,"" according to a statement from CDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlund.However, experts interviewed by CNN questioned whether the protection conferred by the booster is sufficient to prevent transmission of the virus.  Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said that although it's ""noble"" to think that getting the booster will help protect others, the shot is much less effective at preventing transmission compared with the original vaccine at earlier points in the pandemic.  ""Your chances of getting infected are altered very little with the [booster], so you can't say with any scientific integrity that protecting others is why you should get it,"" said Osterholm, who in a recent podcast emphasized the importance of getting boosted if you're at higher risk for serious illness.   ""My focus is on people who are 65 and older and those who are immune-compromised. That's who I think really should get"" the booster, Osterholm told CNN, noting that more people in those groups need to go out and get the shot.   Covid-19 killed fewer people in the US in 2022, but early data suggests it was still a leading cause of death On one end of the spectrum of debate over the booster, Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, has argued against campaigns to convince healthy young people to get the shot.  ""Booster dosing is probably best reserved for the people most likely to need protection against severe disease -- specifically, older adults, people with multiple coexisting conditions that put them at high risk for serious illness, and those who are immunocompromised,"" Offit, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote last month in the New England Journal of Medicine.   ""In the meantime, I believe we should stop trying to prevent all symptomatic infections in healthy, young people by boosting them with vaccines containing mRNA from strains that might disappear a few months later,"" he added.  Offit, who notes that he's 71 and has no underlying health issues, did not get the new booster. He has had three doses of the original vaccine and contracted Covid once and he says he would have considered himself protected against severe disease with either three doses of the original vaccine or two doses plus an infection. On the other end of the spectrum, some experts do think it's important for young, healthy people to get the new booster.

""You can still see a lot of severe Covid, and long Covid can occur with any infection.""  Gendlina, the infectious disease doctor at Montefiore, who is in her mid-40s, said she got the booster as soon as it came out and recommended it to her family, including her teenage son.  ""As we're stepping away from masking, it's more and more important to get vaccinated,"" she said.  Link-Gelles, the CDC epidemiologist, is 38, and she says she got the booster for several reasons, including that her husband is immune-compromised, they have a daughter in day care and they visit elderly relatives. ""Vaccination to me seems like a slam dunk,"" she said. ""It's very easy to get, [and] you don't have to worry again for a while. It's not going to be perfect, but it is going to provide you some degree of protection and therefore protection against infecting someone else.""

21,"Peter Bergen is CNN's national security analyst, a vice president at New America and a professor of practice at Arizona State University. Bergen is the author of ""The Cost of Chaos: The Trump Administration and the World."" The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. (CNN)Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's new book, ""Never Give an Inch: Fighting for the America I Love,"" combines two well-known genres of the Washington memoir. The first is a gauzy recounting of how a gifted politician rose to power, a figure so heroic that he/she could perhaps be the next commander in chief by virtue of his/her brilliance, humility and a general willingness to serve.Peter Bergen The second is the bitter, score-settling accounts of Washington insiders who position themselves as much smarter than many of their peers.The first category typically ends up in the bargain bin at bookstores. The second category can be considerably more revealing and interesting -- for instance, ""The Room Where It Happened,"" John Bolton's blistering takedown of former President Donald Trump based on his time serving as Trump's third national security adviser.""Never Give an Inch"" combines Pompeo's case that he would be a terrific US president with considerable elements of the score-settling memoir. It is already #5 on the Amazon chart this week, so it's selling quite well. Read MoreIf you have seen Pompeo on television of late, he is almost unrecognizable because he has lost so much weight. Pompeo told the New York Post he lost 90 pounds through a diet and exercise regimen, and laughed at the idea it was motivated by politics, saying, ""I want to be there for my family and hopefully lots of grandchildren.""But Pompeo also told CBS News last week that he would make up his mind about a 2024 presidential run in the ""next handful of months."" Based on a close reading of his book, I bet he will take the plunge. Pompeo could be looking to benefit as Trump loses altitude among some Republicans, and at 59, Pompeo is a spring chicken compared with President Joe Biden and Trump, so if it doesn't work out well this time around, he sets himself up for other runs down the road.Working for a mercurial bossAs head of the CIA and then Secretary of State, Pompeo had a difficult job working for such a mercurial boss. Consider that Trump went from tweeting that ""my nuclear button"" is ""much bigger & more powerful"" to Kim Jong Un to sending the North Korean leader self-described ""love letters."" Trump also publicly fulminated that he could end the war in Afghanistan in a week, but he didn't want to ""kill 10 million people."" Then he ordered Pompeo to get a peace deal done with the Taliban. As part of those negotiations, Pompeo's chief negotiator, Zalmay Khalilzad, strongarmed the elected Afghan government to release 5,000 Taliban prisoners, many of whom promptly returned to the battlefield, according to Afghan officials. Pompeo alleges Haley plotted with Kushner and Ivanka Trump to try to become vice president This episode goes oddly unmentioned in Pompeo's 438-page memoir, which rejoices in the splendidly tendentious title, ""Never Give an Inch."" ""Let's Just Give Away the Store"" might have been a more apt title for how Pompeo's team dealt with the Taliban. Even H.R. McMaster, Trump's second national security adviser, publicly described the peace deal that Pompeo agreed to with the Taliban as a ""surrender agreement.""  Another whiplash moment came as the fight against ISIS in Syria was winding down in December 2018, and Trump ordered all US troops out of Syria. Within two months, Trump reversed himself, and American troops remained in Syria to try to prevent ISIS from reforming.  More confusion resulted when Trump authorized an airstrike against the Iranians in June 2019 and then called it off just as the planes were in the air on the way to their targets. Six months later, Trump authorized the assassination of Iranian military leader Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani, an episode Pompeo covers in interesting detail in his memoir. (Pompeo reportedly has round-the-clock diplomatic security protection due to his role in planning Trump's campaign against Iran.)   Team of vipersIn addition to Trump's sudden reversals, Pompeo also had to navigate the Borgia-level backstabbing that characterized the administration. He loathed Bolton, who, according to Pompeo, was ""constantly scheming to win for himself and no one else."" Pompeo writes that Bolton should be criminally prosecuted for publishing his critical memoir that came out while Trump was still in office, accusing him of treason. Pompeo adds that he would happily be a witness for the prosecution. Ouch.In Pompeo's telling, Nikki Haley, Trump's US ambassador to the United Nations, was allegedly plotting with Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner to oust then-Vice President Mike Pence and appoint herself in the role. However, he offers no substantiation for this claim, and Haley said it didn't happen. Mike Pompeo's disturbing actions The fact that Haley is planning her own presidential 2024 campaign makes the inclusion of this alleged incident in Pompeo's book...interesting.Pompeo takes Trump's first defense secretary, Jim Mattis, to task for his opposition to ""America First"" policies. For instance, he says Mattis didn't want to take military action against Iranian targets that Pompeo thought was merited.Pompeo acknowledges it was something of a miracle that he was the only member of Trump's ""core national security team"" who didn't resign or get fired during the four years he was in the administration.This may partly be because he was a ""heat-seeking missile for Trump's ass,"" as a former US ambassador memorably described Pompeo to The New Yorker's Susan Glasser. Pompeo also shared many of Trump's same policy goals on issues such as Afghanistan, China and Iran. And he bonded with his boss on bucking ""the establishment"" and blasting the media.Pompeo vs. 'the establishment'Pompeo says that during his time as both Trump's CIA director and secretary of state, he was confounded at every turn by ""the establishment."" It's an odd claim for someone who was first in his class at the US Military Academy at West Point, then an editor of the Harvard Law Review and later a US congressman from Kansas. But it's, of course, the same conceit that Trump often uses, claiming he isn't part of the establishment when, in fact, Trump wasn't just born with a silver spoon in his mouth but a silver dinnerware set.For Pompeo, the establishment includes the Foreign Service Officer Corps that he oversaw as secretary of state. He improbably describes it as ""overwhelmingly hard left,"" as if members of Antifa populated the staid halls of the State Department.Then there is the press corps. Trump says he's 'more angry' and 'more committed' to White House bid as he breaks his campaign trail hiatus Pompeo describes The New York Times and The Washington Post as ""bed-wetters who didn't have a grip on reality"" because of their purportedly overwrought reactions to the 2018 murder of Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi officials close to the inner circle of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, widely known as MBS.  (MBS denied involvement in the murder.) Khashoggi was dismembered with an electric saw inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. The fact that The Washington Post strenuously objected to his grisly murder hardly seems like bed-wetting.Pompeo goes on to note that there is ""nearly zero evidence that directly links MBS to ordering the murder."" The word ""directly"" does a lot of work in this sentence, considering that in 2021 the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence declassified its assessment that the Crown Prince ""approved an operation in Istanbul, Turkey to capture or kill Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.""  Foreign policy failuresIn Pompeo's view, Trump's long flirtations with North Korea's Kim averted a nuclear crisis. Pompeo recounts how when he was CIA director, he secretly flew to North Korea to start laying the groundwork for Trump and Kim's later summits. Those summits produced well-publicized grip-and-grins between Kim and Trump, photo-ops that the media covered obsessively, but bupkis in the way of long-term gains.While Trump was in office, the North Koreans continued producing fissile material and tested short-range ballistic missiles. In short, Trump achieved nothing to end the North Korean nuclear program.Similarly, in Pompeo's telling, the US-led campaign of sanctions and ""maximum pressure"" against Iran, combined with pulling the United States out of the Iranian nuclear deal in 2018, also made the world safer.  Yet, according to Trump's own US intelligence agencies, the Iran nuclear deal was working to stop the Iranians from enriching uranium anywhere close to the levels needed for a weapon.  And pulling out of the nuclear deal has now brought the Iranians much closer to having nuclear weapons. As of this month, the Iranians have enough fissile material for ""several nuclear devices,"" according to the International Atomic Energy Agency.  Foreign policy winsTo be fair, the Trump administration did score some real foreign policy wins. The Trump team destroyed much of the ISIS geographical ""caliphate,"" a campaign that had begun under then-President Barack Obama and that was largely completed during the time that Pompeo was CIA director. The Trump team also brokered the Abraham Accords. While not of the same importance as the 1978 peace deal between Israel and Egypt which President Jimmy Carter negotiated -- that was between two countries that had been at war for decades -- the Abraham Accords did get Arab states such as Bahrain, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates to recognize Israel for the first time. Mike Pompeo Fast FactsThe big foreign policy issue that the Trump national security team got right was taking the real measure of China. There had long been a bipartisan American delusion that as China got richer, it would also liberalize. That delusion most definitely ended with the Trump administration.Pompeo gives the usual laundry list of complaints against China: its theft of intellectual property and the uneven playing field American companies face when they work in China versus how Chinese companies can work in the United States. Pompeo describes the Chinese Communist Party as ""our most dangerous adversary.""  Pompeo explains how the Trump administration sought to undercut the influence of Chinese telecom giant Huawei. The Trump team saw Huawei as a threat because by sitting on 5G networks around the world, it could gather massive amounts of personal, commercial and national security data. Pompeo set up a State Department task force to counter Huawei, which he says resulted in 60 countries agreeing not to do business with it. As a result, the US government ""crushed Huawei's global telecom business,"" according to Pompeo.   Pompeo's faith A theme that Pompeo returns to often in his memoir is his religious faith. He recounts how a chance encounter with a Bible study group when he was at West Point turned him into a fervent Christian.  As a result, Pompeo's account of supporting religious freedom worldwide is credible. He is rightly exercised about the treatment of the Muslim Uyghur minority in China. The US government and UN  estimated that up to two million Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities were detained in a giant network of internment camps despite Chinese denials of human rights violations. Pompeo is proud that the State Department officially pronounced what was happening to the Uyghurs a genocide, a measure he took on his penultimate day in office. The Biden administration has since formalized Pompeo's genocide label on China's treatment of the Uyghurs. Biden has also kept in place Trump-era measures designed to penalize China, such as significant tariffs on Chinese goods, while continuing US Navy ""freedom of navigation"" operations in the South China Sea to prevent it from becoming a Chinese lake. Biden and UkraineSpeaking of Biden, Pompeo inhabits a parallel universe where the 46th President's ""weakness is the gift to (Vladimir) Putin that keeps on giving.""  That's a truly bonkers assertion given that the Biden administration has authorized $48 billion of humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine, including highly accurate HIMARS missiles and soon M1 Abrams tanks. As a result, Russia is being pushed back on many fronts during the largest land war in Europe since World War II. The US-led NATO alliance may also expand to include formerly nonaligned Finland and Sweden. All this demonstrates real leadership coming from Biden and Pompeo's successor as secretary of state, Antony Blinken.Red meat for Republican votersThe January 6, 2021, assault on Congress is almost completely absent in Pompeo's memoir. He mentions the insurrection briefly only in the context of denying reports that he ever had a discussion with a fellow Cabinet member to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office after the attack.

""The storming of the U.S. Capitol today is unacceptable. Lawlessness and rioting — here or around the world — is always unacceptable."" Pompeo surely knows that if he is to do well in a Republican presidential primary, the base takes it as an article of faith that the election was ""stolen,"" and so dwelling on the insurrection doesn't help his cause. However, he has plenty to say about the ""Russia hoax,"" which he discusses on a dozen pages. It's a way to throw red meat to the Republican base, which, after all, seems to be at least half the point of Pompeo's new book.

Arctic blastParts of the Northeast US are bracing today for possibly the coldest wind chills in decades. Dangerously frigid temperatures with wind chills as cold as 50 degrees Fahrenheit below zero are set to wallop New England and surrounding regions beginning this morning, the Weather Prediction Center said. All of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut are under wind chill alerts. Northern New Jersey, northeast Pennsylvania and much of New York state outside of New York City and Long Island are also under wind chill threats. Officials are warning people to stay indoors as such extreme conditions can cause frostbite in as little as 10 minutes. Fortunately, the cold spell will only last about 36 hours, forecasts show. This comes as the South is struggling with a deadly ice storm that made road conditions miserable this week, claiming the lives of at least eight people in two states.Read More2. Spy balloonUS officials are tracking a suspected Chinese high-altitude surveillance balloon floating above the northern US. It is currently ""traveling at an altitude well above commercial air traffic and does not present a military or physical threat to people on the ground,"" Pentagon spokesman Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder said Thursday. Senior military officials advised President Joe Biden not to shoot down the balloon -- which is the size of three buses -- due to fear that the falling debris could pose a safety threat to civilians. Officials say they are confident the balloon belongs to the People's Republic of China, and although its current flight path carries it over ""a number of sensitive sites,"" officials say it does not present a significant intelligence gathering risk. JUST WATCHEDSee suspected China spy balloon fly over US skies ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSee suspected China spy balloon fly over US skies  03:313. UkraineThe US is expected to announce a new Ukraine security package worth approximately $2.2 billion that includes longer-range missiles for the first time. The type of missiles included in the package will effectively double the range of Ukrainian weaponry, officials say, reaching a range of approximately 90 miles. This will be the first security package since the US committed to providing Ukraine with advanced M-1 Abrams tanks in January, a decision made in coordination with European countries providing German-made Leopard 2 tanks. The weapons will not arrive in Ukraine immediately, since they will not come directly out of US inventories. Instead, the US will contract with weapons manufacturers -- a process that could take weeks or months while the war drags on. The announcement of the new package, however, could come as soon as today.JUST WATCHEDKherson city was liberated 12 weeks ago.

Tobacco banMost US adults support banning sales of all tobacco products, according to a new CDC survey. Although cigarette smoking has declined in recent decades, it remains the leading cause of preventable disease, disability and death in the US, where nearly 31 million adults currently smoke. Meanwhile, the FDA is still considering its proposed ban on menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars. Experts say menthol -- the last flavor allowed in cigarettes -- makes smoking easier to start and harder to quit. The additive can mask the harshness and irritation of tobacco, making cigarettes more appealing to young people and those who have never used tobacco products. It also enhances the effect of nicotine in the brain, making tobacco products even more addictive. One study published in 2021 estimated that a menthol cigarette ban in the US could prevent up to 650,000 premature deaths over the next 40 years.5. Eye dropsThe manufacturer that distributed eye drops under the brand EzriCare has issued a recall due to possible contamination, the FDA said Thursday. This comes after the CDC said earlier this week it is investigating 55 reports of infections in 12 states that may be linked to the products. Some of the cases resulted in permanent vision loss or hospitalization, and one person died. The drops were sold online across the US in multidose bottles. Consumers should stop using them and report any adverse reactions to the FDA, health officials said. New Jersey-based EzriCare said in a statement that after learning about the investigation on January 20, it ""immediately took action to stop any further distribution"" of the eye drops and has been ""contacting customers to advise them against continued use of the product.""BREAKFAST BROWSEDo you wear jeans and pajamas again without washing them?Another wear wouldn't hurt, right?

He is also a former senior policy adviser to Congress' Joint Economic Committee. Follow him on Twitter. The views expressed in this piece are his own. View more opinion on CNN. (CNN)The 1918 influenza outbreak left millions dead in its wake and impacted daily life in ways similar to our own recent coronavirus pandemic. But in popular culture, it vanished largely without a trace nearly as soon it was over. Americans were ready to turn the page on war and pestilence and let loose in the roaring '20s. One senses a similar dynamic today. With the pandemic almost officially behind us, January 6 a fading memory and the economy beginning to return to normal, many Americans appear ready for a politics that focuses on new challenges rather than rehashing old battles over mask mandates and election integrity. At its best, President Joe Biden's State of the Union speech offered that forward-looking vision, highlighting his administration's commitment to rebuilding America's supply chain and spurring innovation. But no amount of rhetoric could disguise the fact that our political system could be on a collision course to offer up the rematch no one is asking for.  It's still early. But a 2024 presidential election that features another slugfest between two elderly leaders rather than a scrappy fight between up-and-coming politicians with energy and enthusiasm would be doing the nation a disservice. Read MoreNew polling suggests a growing desire for new faces. 58% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters told a Washington Post/ABC News poll they hoped their party nominates someone other than Biden in 2024. According to the poll, 49% of Republican and Republican-leaning voters said the same thing about former President Donald Trump.The dynamics in each party are slightly different -- Democrats are restive but appear to lack anyone in the wings capable of mounting a compelling primary challenge. A new Associated Press-NORC poll found the share of Democrats who want Biden to seek a second term had fallen from 52% last year to 37% now (the poll was fielded before the State of the Union.) Younger Democrats, especially, hunger for a new face -- just under one-quarter of those age 18-44 hope Biden would run again. On the Republican side, some party loyalists have a contender in mind. While Trump benefits from a dedicated base of support and, so far, being the only official candidate in the race, his victory is far from certain. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who, at 44, is closer in age to the former President's oldest children, has revved up the GOP base with a series of policy wins and culture war battles. Republicans who want to take the battle to ""woke"" institutions and push back against the left's excesses know that the DeSantis model can produce results at the state level. Opinion: Biden plays 'truth or dare' with GOP Other potential challengers, like former US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, face an uncertain path to the nomination but also offer a generational shift and a different set of priorities. And many party operatives will admit that a Trump campaign that looks backward -- at the indignities of the pandemic or his false claims about the 2020 election -- will risk coming across as detached from the challenges facing working-class Americans. Both parties face the temptation of playing it safe. Democrats may be tempted to bank on Biden's ability to speak to working-class Americans to pull out a repeat victory over his predecessor. And Republicans can see polls like the one from the Washington Post and ABC News that suggest that if the election was held today, Trump would likely start with an edge over Biden. And even if a younger candidate tried to push aside a more seasoned candidate, an explicit age-based argument can backfire. Just ask former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julián Castro, who learned the hard way that attack lines that seem to focus on an older candidate's memory or hearing do not play well. Any politician trying to campaign against a more senior opponent would have to be careful about not sounding dismissive toward older Americans' ability to contribute -- after all, senior citizens are reliable voters.Opinion: Biden's very tough decisionBut the fact remains -- the incumbent President and his presidential predecessor were alive for the creation of NATO, the founding of the People's Republic of China and the state of Israel, the first color TV broadcast and other events that all but approximately 5% of Americans only know of from history books.  There is a wisdom in age and valuable perspective in having seen the long sweep of history. But both the President and the former President should have the foresight to recognize the desire for a change is not ageism, but a recognition of the demands of the job and the need for new voices and ideas.Both Trump and Biden fulfilled their stated primary objectives as President --Trump, to draw attention to the plight of the ""forgotten men and women of our country"" and to raise questions about the logic of globalization that turned a blind eye to the rise of China, and Biden, to seek a return to something closer to normalcy after the four chaotic years that preceded him.

The 2020 primary election for Democrats was singularly focused on choosing the best candidate who could beat Trump. Perhaps Biden may still be the right man for the job. But a presidential debate stage featuring a younger, more energetic politician focused on issues of the moment would draw a stark contrast with one whose habits were formed during the Cold War. Whether that's a younger Democratic nominee more effectively tapping into discontent over the Dobbs decision's impact on abortion rights, or a Republican candidate speaking, as a parent of young children, about the need to better protect kids online, a passing of the generational torch will allow for a much-needed shift of focus to fresh challenges.

24,"Sign up for CNN's Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. (CNN)In the past year, a tiny helicopter flew on Mars, a NASA spacecraft slammed into an asteroid and the James Webb Space Telescope revealed dazzling new insights about the universe. Beginning decades ago as ideas that seemed more like science fiction, these missions took years of research and testing to come to life. Technological advances and scientific breakthroughs have transformed how we observe and investigate the cosmos. How will space exploration change in the coming decades, and what new possibilities will emerge?These questions are at the heart of NASA's Innovative Advanced Concepts program, or NIAC, which awards funding for concepts that could be part of future missions. ""NASA dares to make the impossible possible,"" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in a statement. ""That's only achievable because of the innovators, thinkers, and doers who are helping us imagine and prepare for the future of space exploration. The NIAC program helps give these forward-thinking scientists and engineers the tools and support they need to spur technology that will enable future NASA missions.""Read MoreThe lastest NIAC competition selected 14 new concepts, awarding each $175,000 in January. Now, these researchers have nine months to use that funding toward refining and testing their ideas to see whether they can advance to the second phase of funding, which is $600,000 to flesh out their concepts and bring them closer to reality. Only five projects have made it to the third phase during the NIAC program — $2 million to make something implementable.Active since 2011, the competitive program is open to a broad range of ideas as long as they are technically credible, said Michael LaPointe, program executive for NIAC at NASA.Some of the latest NIAC-funded concepts include a fluid space telescope, self-growing bricks intended for Mars and a plane that could fly on Saturn's moon Titan, among others. Many of the ideas are the result of creative collaborations between experts in different fields challenging one another to come up with new ideas.""It really is a community of innovators,"" LaPointe said. ""We're looking for ideas that will enable brand-new ways of doing things.""Self-growing bricks for MarsFor the past few years, Congrui Jin and her research group have used bacteria and fungi to heal cracks in concrete. Jin, an assistant professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, now wants to take her idea to space. Her self-growing bricks could one day build habitats and other structures for human explorers on the red planet. Congrui Jin's group has focused on how bacteria and fungi can create biominerals that can heal concrete cracks.The concept would involve sending bacterial and fungal spores and a bioreactor to Mars. The bioreactor is needed for the microbes to survive because Mars' natural environment would be too harsh for them. But Mars would provide the rest of the necessary ingredients for the self-growing bricks, including dust and soil, sunlight, nitrogen, carbon dioxide and water from melted ice. In turn, the bacteria can produce oxygen and organic carbon to support the fungi. The process, once all of these ingredients are inside the bioreactor, would also create calcium carbonate to serve as the glue. The bacteria, fungi and minerals will bind Martian soil together to form blocks, which can later be used to make floors, walls and even furniture.This illustration shows how Jin's concept could be used to grow bricks on Mars.Jin's group, which includes some students, screens the most suitable types of fungi and bacteria and tests which ones work best together. The team is also building a bioreactor to calibrate the atmosphere, pressure, temperature and illumination required to grow the bricks.""The very important feature of this technology is its autonomous nature, and it doesn't require any human intervention,"" Jin said. ""We initially just need to provide small quantities of spores to start this process, and the rest is automatic.""Flying TitanAirSaturn's moon Titan has long intrigued astronomers with its thick atmosphere and lakes and rivers of methane. It's a unique place in our solar system in which chemistry that's taking place may be similar to what occurred on early Earth. A rover-size drone called Dragonfly is expected to launch for this moon in 2027 to study its fine-grained, drier organic material. Quinn Morley, principal investigator at Planet Enterprises in Gig Harbor, Washington, and his collaborators at Washington State University and other institutions envision a complementary Titan mission to explore the wetter regions of the intriguing moon. The seaplane-like design, called TitanAir, would soar through Titan's atmosphere and sail on its lakes. The TitanAir concept would function like a seaplane on Saturn's moon Titan.TitanAir could reach the moon about a decade after Dragonfly ""to help unlock key secrets of this alien planet,"" Morley said. The front section of the plane's wing would ""drink"" liquid methane that forms on the wing's surface as the plane flies through rain clouds. The liquid collected inside the wing could be analyzed by instruments and transmitted back to Earth. A small rover or helicopter could fly to places the plane can't reach and return samples to the plane. Beginning in the fall, Morley wants to partner with engineering student design teams at Washington State on ideas for TitanAir. ""The analysis of clouds, lakes, and shorelines allows us to attack the search for life in three unique ways with one spacecraft,"" Morley said in an email, ""increasing our chances of unlocking these profound mysteries.""Fluid telescopeLarge space observatories such as the Hubble Space Telescope and Webb telescope are the result of decades of funding, design, assembly and testing. But there is a growing demand for a wider range of telescopes that can be developed cheaper and more quickly.Several new NIAC concepts offer diverse ways of observing the cosmos like never before. One design is FLUTE, or the Fluidic Telescope, from Edward Balaban, a research scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center in California, and his collaborators. Balaban has mostly worked in artificial intelligence and strategic planning for the upcoming VIPER lunar rover mission.A telescope filled with fluid (right) and an instrumentation spacecraft (left) would work together to spy on invisible aspects of the universe.Balaban was inspired through conversations with colleagues both at Ames and the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology to develop a concept that could combine manipulating fluids with on-orbit assembly of a large telescope. The latter wouldn't be limited by the size of its launch vehicle. Under the plan, two launches would send an instrumentation spacecraft and a frame that can be filled with liquid into space. The liquid-filled frame creates a massive 50-meter (164-foot) mirror, while the instrumentation spacecraft will remain at a specific distance from the mirror to collect images and send them back to Earth, Balaban saidBalaban and his team are testing liquids that could act as the mirror, including ionic liquids called molten salts. Researchers will use their grant to work on constructing a frame to hold the liquid and the design for the instrumentation spacecraft. Such a telescope could be impervious to the micrometeoroid strikes that the Webb telescope has experienced because the liquids wouldn't be affected, he said. A large light-collecting surface such as FLUTE could glimpse the faint light of early galaxies or look inside the atmospheres of exoplanets. ""Believe it or not, we might be able to start seeing surface features on the nearest exoplanets,"" Balaban said. ""Instead of seeing them as pinpoints of light, we might be able to tell if they have continents, for example.""Searching for another EarthMeanwhile, Heidi Jo Newberg, a professor of physics, applied physics, and astronomy at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and her collaborators have a concept for a telescope that could find ""Earth 2.0.""The team's idea is to search for nearby habitable planets by changing up the centuries-old design for telescopes. It's called DICER, or a Diffractive Interfero Coronagraph Exoplanet Resolver.Earth-size exoplanets are small and faint, especially compared with the bright stars they orbit, so conventional thinking suggests that searching for such planets would require a telescope with three times the diameter of the Webb telescope — which at 6.5 meters (21 feet 4 inches) is the largest mirror ever flown in space. A 20-meter (65-foot) telescope currently isn't feasible because it would be difficult to launch such a large mirror into space. The DICER telescope's diffraction gratings and mirrors could collect the same amount of light as a large telescope.But DICER would rely on two small mirrors as well as two 10-meter diffraction gratings, or optical components that diffract light, that can be easily packed up inside a rocket. Think about the rainbow visible on the back of a CD when you hold it up to the light — that's diffraction grating. The gratings could collect the same amount of light as a 20-meter telescope.""This idea brings down the size and the weight of what you have to send up into space to get the desired high resolution of a telescope like Webb,"" Newberg said. ""What we're trying to do is exploit this out-of-the-box design to make it possible to find Earth-like planets.""The team will work on the scale of the optics and determine whether the telescope could also be used to study exoplanet atmospheres. The invisible skyDespite advances in the types of light telescopes can see, low-frequency radio waves remain invisible to us. Dr. Mary Knapp, a research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Haystack Observatory, and her collaborators are working on a concept that could reveal this part of the radio wave spectrum. The waves are unobservable by ground-based radio telescopes due to the distorting effects of Earth's upper atmosphere.""I learned back in my undergrad days that there was this part of the spectrum we couldn't see,"" Knapp said. ""It really just struck me that there was this unexplored part of the universe, and I want to explore this part of the sky for the first time."" The Go-LoW concept would be composed of thousands of tiny satellites working together to create one virtual telescope.The Great Observatory for Long Wavelengths, or GO-LoW, would rely on a fleet of thousands of shoebox-size satellites that act in concert, like one large virtual telescope. Small satellites are cost-effective, and mega-constellations of them can be launched at once on a single, large rocket.The observatory could measure low-frequency electromagnetic radiation, which would carry a wealth of data for astronomers who want to observe the oldest stars and galaxies and understand the magnetic fields of exoplanets and stars. This information can help scientists more easily spot habitable planets. Magnetic fields help planets maintain their atmospheres.The team will focus next on the antenna design for the satellites and the potential architecture needed for the satellites in space. If GO-LoW is developed, it could be used to create a new map of the sky.""Anytime we look at the universe in a new part of the spectrum, we've seen things we didn't expect,"" Knapp said. ""I'm really excited about what we don't know.""","Fluid telescope, a moon plane and self-growing Mars bricks: Sci-fi concepts that could change how we explore space",CNN,2023-02-04T14:26:35Z,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/04/world/nasa-niac-space-exploration-concepts-scn/index.html
25," (CNN)The man who allegedly attacked New York police officers with a machete on New Year's Eve pleaded not guilty to state charges in court Wednesday.Trevor Bickford, 19, appeared in a Manhattan courtroom wearing a tan uniform with his wrists and ankles shackled. He spoke only to enter his plea. Bickford was indicted January 6 on 18 counts, nine of which included charges of first-degree attempted murder, assault, aggravated assault on a police officer, attempted aggravated assault on a police officer and attempted assault in furtherance of an act or as a crime of terrorism, according to the indictment. Bickford was indicted last month on 18 counts, including charges of first-degree attempted murder. He is also facing several other charges related to assault, attempted assault and attempted murder. CNN has reached out to Rosemary Vassallo-Vellucci, Bickford's attorney with the Legal Aid Society, for comment. Last month, the attorney said her client should be presumed innocent.Read MoreOn New Year's Eve, Bickford allegedly entered the security area of the Times Square checkpoint, pulled out a machete and struck an officer with the blade and another officer in the head with the handle, authorities have said. He then swung the blade at a third officer, who shot the suspect in the shoulder, according to the NYPD.Bickford told authorities during his interview that he said ""(Allahu) Akbar"" before he walked up and hit the officer over the head with the weapon, according to a criminal complaint.Suspect in New Year's Eve machete attack now facing federal charges of attempted murderProsecutors have alleged the suspect said that all government officials were his target, since they ""cannot be proper Muslims because the United States government supports Israel.""The three officers were hospitalized in stable condition and have since been released.The suspect was interviewed in December by federal agents in Maine after he said he wanted to travel overseas to help fellow Muslims and was willing to die for his religion, multiple law enforcement officers have said.In addition to the state charges, Bickford faces federal charges of four counts of attempted murder and is expected back in Manhattan federal court on February 20. New York prosecutors said they have received body camera footage, grand jury minutes, surveillance video and medical records related to the case, but have yet to receive material requested from the federal government's case. Defense motions must be filed by March 22 and prosecutors must respond by April 12, Judge Gregory Carro said. He will issue a decision on May 3.CNN's Rob Frehse contributed to this report.
