The views expressed here are his own. Read more opinion at CNN. (CNN)Long before the current war in Ukraine began nearly a year ago, Israel has maintained strict neutrality in the hostilities between Russia and Ukraine. That may be about to change.Anshel Pfeffer Since he came to power at the end of 1999, Russian President Vladimir Putin has gone out of his way to court the Israeli leadership. He made sure to hold a meeting at least once a year with Netanyahu , usually at his residences in Sochi or Moscow, and every few years he would travel to Jerusalem.A former Russian diplomat explained to me that ""Putin respects strength and sees Israel as a strong country with which he wants to be on good terms.""The same is true of Israel's leaders, especially of Netanyahu . Read Netanyahu was so proud of what Netanyahu claimed was a close relationship with Putin that in 2019 Netanyahu used photographs of them together as part of Netanyahu election campaign. Netanyahu has claimed on multiple occasions that their relationship was advantageous to Israel's strategic interests.One instance of this was when Russia first deployed its military to war-torn Syria in September 2015 to prop up President Bashar Assad's blood-soaked regime. Within days, Netanyahu was in Moscow at the head of a military delegation for an unscheduled meeting with Putin.The two leaders reached an agreement whereby Israel would continue to operate in Syrian airspace but would only attack targets linked to its enemy Iran, while leaving Assad's forces untouched. A ""deconfliction mechanism,"" including a hotline between the Russian command center in Syria and Israel's air force headquarters, was swiftly established.Opinion: Netanyahu wants peace, but offers few solutionsOver the years, senior Israeli officials have been at pains to emphasize that while Israel's chief strategic ally remains the United States, it was crucial to maintain coordination with the Russians. In 2014, despite pressure from Washington, Israel refused to join the western governments in condemning Russia's annexation of Crimea. Strict neutrality was to be maintained throughout.When Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24 last year, Netanyahu was not in office. The prime minister was Naftali Bennett and he stuck to the neutrality policy. Bennett explained to me that ""we are not in the same position as other countries. We have Russia just over our border in Syria. We have to take into consideration the presence of large Jewish communities in both Russia and Ukraine which could be impacted. And besides, it's useful for everyone to have a government like Israel which has good ties with both sides to serve as a go-between."" In the early weeks of the war, Bennett embarked on a peace mission in which he both visited Putin in the Kremlin and had multiple conversations with Ukrainian President Vlodymyr Zelensky. He insists that ""there was a 50% chance of reaching a ceasefire, sadly it failed."" He also claims that his involvement helped broker short-term local truces, which allowed saving civilians from the war zone. Opinion: Don't expect Biden to confront Netanyahu anytime soon Any hope of a ceasefire has long vanished, and Ukraine has since publicly requested Israel help supply it with arms, especially with missile defense systems like the Iron Dome. Israel has sent humanitarian aid but has refused to send any weapons. In recent months, as Russia began using Iranian drones to attack Ukrainian targets, Israel has agreed to supply Kyiv, through NATO, with intelligence and technical information on how to counter the Iranian drone threat.Not everyone in the Israeli leadership agreed with Netanyahuneutral policy. Netanyahu political partner and then-foreign minister Yair Lapid was more forthright in publicly condemning Russian war crimes in Ukraine. Opinions were divided in the country's security establishment as well. One Israeli general told me that ""the fear of Russia is overblown and Israel could have been much more supportive of Ukraine without any fear of retribution.""Ten months after the Russian invasion, Netanyahu returned to office. Suddenly Netanyahu was a lot less friendly toward Putin. Netanyahu took one congratulatory phone call from him a week before Netanyahu inauguration, but that was all. Meanwhile, in media interviews, Netanyahu has said that Netanyahu is reconsidering Israel's policy on the Ukraine war, though Netanyahu wouldn't specify any details.One Israeli general told me that ""the fear of Russia is overblown and Israel could have been much more supportive of Ukraine without any fear of retribution.""Anshel Pfeffer""Netanyahu has two immediate reasons for changing policy and supporting Ukraine,"" a former Israeli intelligence officer who was deeply involved in Israel's military relationship with Russia, told me.""First, Russia has greatly diluted its forces in Syria as they were needed in Ukraine. The threat to Israel from them is now negligible,"" the officer said.""Second, Russia is now using Iranian drones and missiles on the battlefield and Israel now has a valuable opportunity to supply Ukraine with defense systems so we can see how well they do in an actual war. One day we may have to face the same Iranian weapons,"" the officer added. An Israeli diplomat adds another reason why Netanyahu would consider supporting Ukraine more forcefully. Unlike the Netanyahu-Lapid government, Netanyahu new coalition of far-right and ultra-religious parties is regarded with suspicion by the Biden administration that has already voiced its displeasure with the new government's plans for a legal overhaul, which drastically weaken the powers and independence of Israel's supreme court.Get our free weekly newsletterSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook Last week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Jerusalem, and unlike on such visits in the past, didn't extend Netanyahu an invitation to the White House.An Israeli shift toward Kyiv could be Netanyahubest hope of currying favor with Washington.",Opinion: Why Netanyahu is suddenly a lot less friendly with Putin,CNN,2023-02-07T15:24:25Z,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/07/opinions/netanyahu-putin-israel-russia-ukraine-pfeffer/index.html
1,"Sign up to get this weekly column as a newsletter. We're looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. (CNN)More than a decade has passed since Mitt Romney lost political support during his failed 2012 presidential campaign for boasting about having ""binders full of women"" suitable for government appointments and writing off the ""47% of Americans"" who pay no federal income tax. But his remark about Russia being America's ""number one geopolitical foe"" — which was widely ridiculed at the time — now seems prescient in the wake of Vladimir Putin's murderous invasion of Ukraine. In the past few years, the senator from Utah has earned a reputation for being a rare, candid voice in Washington, willing to buck his party. He was the lone Republican who voted to remove President Donald Trump from office in his first impeachment trial and one of seven to do so in Trump's second impeachment. Minutes before the State of the Union speech Tuesday, Romney encountered the scandal-ridden Republican Rep. George Santos on the House floor and told him what many of the New York congressman's constituents — and others around the country — are saying: ""You don't belong here."" (Santos told reporters afterward: ""It wasn't very Mormon of him."")Even more tellingly, Romney broke with his party's stance on China's spy balloon. After a closed-door briefing by administration officials Thursday, Romney told reporters, ""I believe that the administration, the president, our military and intelligence agencies, acted skillfully and with care,"" and said he agreed with their decision to wait to shoot down the balloon until it moved over the Atlantic Ocean, off the Carolinas. Read MoreHouse Republicans, who were initially planning a resolution condemning the Biden administration for not bringing down the balloon sooner, switched the wording to condemn the government of China for sending the craft over US territory in the first place. It passed 419-0, a small act of bipartisanship only two days after a group of House Republicans heckled President Joe Biden as he was addressing both houses in his annual speech. There are not a lot of Romneys — or indeed any — in the ranks of the extreme GOPers who bucked their own House Speaker's shushing to shout their displeasure at Biden's remarks.""Some members of the Republican caucus seemed keen to highlight the distinctions between the thoughtful, unity-emphasizing Biden and their own party's shameful descent,"" wrote Jill Filipovic. ""Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, among others, repeatedly booed and yelled throughout the speech; when he introduced the parents of Tyre Nichols, who was last month fatally beaten by Memphis police officers, and the Ukrainian ambassador, she stayed seated. That perhaps says more than Biden ever could.""ShushingSE Cupp called McCarthy's ""shushing"" a ""surprisingly gallant act of leadership from someone who has aligned himself with former President Donald Trump, voted to overturn the 2020 election results and packed the House Oversight Committee with election deniers."" ""Will he continue to 'shush' the extremist, conspiratorial and 'Never Biden' wing of his party — whom he has empowered and elevated — as they act out and get in the way of his agenda, which might even include working with Biden from time to time?""Geoff Duncan, a Republican who formerly served as Georgia's lieutenant governor, wrote that ""neither the southern border nor inflation received much attention from the president — despite both issues being of importance to voters. Neither did the Chinese spy balloon, whose coast-to-coast journey undermines Biden's tough talk toward Chinese President Xi Jinping."" Biden ""was feisty, full of energy, marshaled his arguments effectively and even batted back Republican catcalls with good humor,"" observed David Gergen. ""By the end of the evening, he looked like a boxer who can't wait to get into the ring again.""""But he now faces an even sterner test: Did he actually move the needle? Among presidents of the recent past, a public appearance as powerful as this one could shake up politics. Former Presidents Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan each had the capacity to change minds when they held a microphone."" The president's ""discussion of 'the talk' that Black parents give to their children about how to safely interact with police officers was the most moving part of his speech,"" wrote former Rep. Mondaire Jones, a Democrat. ""Still, it was political malpractice for him not to explicitly call for Congress to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. The family of Tyre Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man who was fatally beaten by Memphis police officers last month, deserved to hear it."" PopulismRaul Reyes noted that ""Biden smartly aligned himself with populist issues, like making wealthy corporations pay their fair share of taxes and proposing that all federal infrastructure projects use American-made materials.""  The 80-year-old president's vision was decidedly blue-collar — and 20th century — in its aim to rebuild America's manufacturing base and reduce the reliance on trade with the rest of the world. But, as Julian Zelizer pointed out, ""times have changed and Biden has a tough road ahead. While the president offered a robust vision of how federal investment has and could create jobs in key sectors such as the semi-conductor industry and infrastructure, the kinds of manufacturing jobs that were at the heart of federal investment between the 1930s and 1960s have vastly diminished and are not likely to return."" ""Biden needs to acknowledge how his economic populism will address the industries of the 2020s rather than those of the 1950s and 1960s."" Biden's success in 2020 owed a lot to the contrast with the chaos and extremism of the Trump administration, Bill McGowan and Juliana Silva wrote. The outbursts by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and her colleagues allow Biden to surf the same wave now. ""By keeping the hostility factor high, the GOP is also paving the way for Biden to reuse in 2024 one of his stickiest and most effective campaign messages from 2020: that the election is nothing short of a battle for the 'soul of the nation.' Thanks to the new breed of attention-seeking, far-right Republicans, Biden gets to go back to that well regardless of whether Trump is his opponent or not."" The president turned the heckling to his advantage by getting Republicans to deny any intention of cutting Social Security or Medicare. ""You can say Mr. Biden fibbed, misled and exaggerated, and you wouldn't be wrong,"" Peggy Noonan wrote in the Wall Street Journal, ""but in rope-a-doping Republicans on Medicare and Social Security he showed real mastery."" New generation?In ""a scathing rebuke"" to Biden's speech that served as the GOP's official reply, ""Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said it's time for a new generation of Republican leadership,"" Alice Stewart noted.""At 40, Sanders is the youngest governor in the country. She spoke of Biden as the oldest president in American history, and at 80-years-old, she said, he is simply 'unfit to serve as commander in chief.'""Left unsaid was that Trump, Sanders' former boss, would be 78 by Election Day, 2024 — and he is running for the presidency again.Patrick T. Brown spoke for a lot of Americans when he pleaded for something other than a Biden-Trump rematch: ""A 2024 presidential election that features another slugfest between two elderly leaders rather than a scrappy fight between up-and-coming politicians with energy and enthusiasm would be doing the nation a disservice.""""New polling suggests a growing desire for new faces. 58% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters told a Washington Post/ABC News poll they hoped their party nominates someone other than Biden in 2024. According to the poll, 49% of Republican and Republican-leaning voters said the same thing about former President Donald Trump.""

A devastating earthquake had struck and they hurried out of the building in their pajamas into snow-filled streets. Taking refuge in their car, away from any buildings, Alomar spoke to CNN Opinion's Sheena McKenzie about the toll the quake is taking on a region already devastated by war. Alomar is a pediatrician who works as a senior health adviser with the Syrian American Medical Society, providing medical assistance across the border. ""In northwest Syria, we are already suffering from a shortage of supplies, and we are now using the regular inventories in our warehouses,"" Alomar said.""So we are in urgent need of additional support to compensate these supplies for regular operations — and also to be ready for aftershocks and more casualties who may come to our hospitals."" In the New York Times, Turkish author and Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk wrote, ""Aid has been dispatched, but the trucks loaded with supplies are stuck for hours on jammed roads hundreds of miles from the affected areas. People who have lost their homes, their families, their loved ones, everything they ever had find that there is nobody doing anything about the fires beginning to break out in their cities. And so they block the path of any official vehicle, policeman or government employee they can find and start to remonstrate.

""Then on February 24, Russia's total invasion blasted these concerns into the background.

China would have shot it down ""without hesitation, regardless of any risk to Chinese citizens or property.""""So China's protestations about the outrageousness of the US shootdown of a spy balloon flying over our sovereign territory seem a little rich, to put it mildly,"" Sanner wrote.  ""I understand why Americans were alarmed by the balloon,"" she added, ""but there are much bigger threats posed by China. We should address the shortcomings this incident exposed — including what appears to be gaps in our air defense and detection systems that would have allowed us to shoot such a balloon down before it ever reached US landfall — but political one-upmanship on such a fraught and grave matter as relations with China is dangerous."" Napoleon's soldiers used balloons for surveillance in 1794, as did Union soldiers during the US Civil War. Peter Bergen's father worked on a US Air Force program that sent balloons over the Soviet Union in the 1950s, Bergen wrote. But there's newer technology in the form of satellites that can take video, use thermal imagery to detect people moving around at night and ""spy on pretty much anything, with a resolution of centimeters,"" Bergen noted. ""In other words, the overflight of US territory by China's balloon is not a national security catastrophe as a bunch of hyperventilating Republican politicians from former President Donald Trump on downward have implied,"" Bergen added.

Lots of other lifestyle choices, plus genetics, may enable people to do just fine with such a diet. But CNN Opinion's Kirsi Goldynia wrote, ""As endearing as it is to imagine a politician scarfing down a frank with all the fixings or a bowl of chocolate ice cream, new research is exposing the health impacts of diets like Pelosi's, high in ultraprocessed foods.""""Pelosi isn't an outlier. In the US, a whopping 58% of adults' daily calories, and 67% of kids' daily calories, come from ultraprocessed foods, according to cancer epidemiologist Fang Fang Zhang."" A raft of recent studies has demonstrated that consuming ultraprocessed foods increases the risk of cancer and cognitive decline as people age. Goldynia interviewed Marion Nestle, a nutrition expert and retired professor at New York University. ""Studies show that ultraprocessed foods encourage people to eat more calories,"" Nestle said, ""and the subjects gain weight as a result. So, if you want to do something about obesity, and you want to lose weight, one way to do that would be to eat fewer ultraprocessed foods...

2,"Jerusalem (CNN)A car drove into several people at a bus stop in Jerusalem on Friday, killing a man and a young child in what Israeli police described as a ""ramming terror attack."" A second child died of his injuries Saturday.Yaakov Yisrael Paley, 6, and Alter Shlomo Lederman, 20, died Friday at the Ramot intersection, an area Israel considers to be a neighborhood in northern Jerusalem. The boy's brother, 8-year-old Asher Menachem Paley, who was ""critically wounded"" during the attack, died in hospital on Saturday, according to a statement by the hospital, Shaare Zedek.He was pronounced dead after ""many teams from the trauma unit, from the ER, pediatric intensive care, pediatric surgery and neurosurgery fought for many hours for his life,"" according to the statement.The 42-year-old father of Asher and Yaakov was injured in the attack and remains in the hospital in ""moderate"" condition, according to Hadassah Medical Center. His 10-year-old son has been released ""after being treated in the emergency room by the medical team."" Read MoreTwo other people were also injured in the incident.Israeli emergency responders gather at the site.The suspect, who was ""neutralized"" at the scene, according to police, was identified as Hussein Qaraqe, a 31-year-old from east Jerusalem. Local journalists in the neighborhood reported that Israeli police had arrested Qaraqe's wife, father and brother, sharing videos of what they said were the arrests.It occurred on land that Israel captured from Jordan in 1967 and then annexed, so Palestinians and many international observers consider it to be a settlement on occupied land.Suspect released from hospital just before attackThe suspect, Qaraqe, had been released from a hospital in Tel Aviv the night before the incident, his uncle told CNN.He had been in hospitalized for a month due to a back injury, said Adnan Qaraqe.""He had a car accident a while ago and severely injured his back which led to more than five surgeries on his spine. He was on very heavy medication and painkillers which affected his nervous system.""Qaraqe said he did not know if the hospital where his nephew had stayed was a mental hospital or whether Hussein was hospitalized for back pain. He said there would be records at his nephew's house that would clarify, but the house has been sealed by Israeli authorities.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave orders on Friday for the house to be sealed and demolished. Residents of Issawiya told CNN that Qaraqe was not the owner of the house, but had rented it.Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir also ordered police checks of vehicles in that neighborhood in the wake of the ramming -- and wanted to go further, he said at the scene of the incident.""I instructed the police to set up roadblocks around Issawiya and stop one by one -- one by one -- and to simply check every vehicle.  I wanted to do a full closure, but there is a legal question about it - and we will discuss it.  In any case, I instructed the police to deploy roadblocks, and they are deploying roadblocks around Issawiya,"" he said.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday responded to the incident in a strongly worded statement on Friday, saying, ""We strongly condemn today's terrorist attack on civilians, including children, at a bus stop in Jerusalem and express our condolences to the families of those killed.""""The deliberate targeting of innocent civilians is repugnant and unconscionable.

3,"A version of this story appears in today's Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, CNN's three-times-a-week look inside the region's biggest stories. Sign up here.Jerusalem (CNN)A shocking 48 hours of violence -- bloody even by the standards of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict -- followed immediately by a fortunately timed flying visit from US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, focused the eyes of the world on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this week. Netanyahu looked back without blinking. Sitting down for an exclusive interview with CNN's Jake Tapper, Netanyahu signaled clearly that it is extremely unlikely Israel and the Palestinians will make any measurable progress toward a long-term peace anytime soon. Netanyahu made clear that while Netanyahu's ""open"" to negotiations with the Palestinians and is willing to cooperate with them on security matters, not much else will move.   Netanyahu has never been a full-throated supporter of a two-state solution, weaving in and out of different definitions of what that would mean. But in recent years Netanyahu's settled on the idea that Netanyahu'd be open to a Palestinian state - as long as it has no military or security power, an arrangement that would have no parallel among modern sovereign states. Read More""I'm certainly willing to have them have all the powers that they need to govern themselves, but none of the powers that can threaten us,"" Netanyahu told Tapper in Jerusalem on Tuesday. Netanyahu did provide some new details about Netanyahu conversations with President Biden on the matter, explaining Netanyahu once told Biden, ""[A]ny final agreement between Israel and the Palestinians would have Israel controlling security -- overriding security responsibility in the area west of the Jordan.  Blinken visit reaches new urgency as Israeli, Palestinian tensions boil ""I said, you can't divide who controls the airspace [between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean]. You have to cross it. It takes two minutes for an airplane to cross it. So what, one minute Israel controls it and the other minute the Palestinians? Of course, it's not workable.  ""He said to me, as others have said to me -- 'you know, but that's not perfect sovereignty.'  ""And I said, you're right. But -- I don't know what you'd call it, but it gives them the opportunity to control their lives, to elect their officials, to run their economy, to run their institutions, to have their flag and to have their parliament, but we have to have overriding security control."" Most Palestinians would view that arrangement as a continuation of the current occupation -- and an unacceptable starting point for peace negotiations.  Collective punishment Tapper pressed Netanyahu over accusations that Israel is engaging in collective punishment of Palestinians in the wake of two shooting attacks targeting Israelis around Jerusalem that killed seven and wounded five. Measures announced by the Israeli cabinet in response included issuing more gun permits for civilians, increasing security for Jewish settlements in the West Bank and pushing draft legislation that would possibly revoke the Israeli residency of families of those accused of engaging in or supporting terrorism.  Netanyahu claimed Netanyahu doesn't ""believe in collective punishment,"" although most human rights organizations call actions targeting the families of attackers exactly that. ""It's not targeting family members. It's targeting family members who were involved in the terror acts or supported it after the act was done ... Netanyahu think that disincentivizes the terrorists,"" Netanyahu said.  The legislation to revoke residency of families of attackers will likely face legal challenges, something Israeli human rights organization HaMoked has already vowed to do. Arab peace before Palestinian peace Netanyahu made clear to Tapper: Netanyahu priority is normalization with Arab nations before peace with the Palestinians. After the success of the Abraham Accords, Netanyahu told Tapper Netanyahu wants to expand the countries in what Netanyahu calls the ""circle of peace,"" with Netanyahu top objective being Saudi Arabia. Israel's rightward shift leaves its new Arab allies in an awkward spot For years, peace with the Palestinians was seen as a precondition for any normalization agreements between Arab countries and Israel. But Netanyahu argued the Abraham Accords changed the game. ""Netanyahu think that the way we're going to succeed is not let the Palestinian tail wag the body of the Arab world,"" Netanyahu said.  ""If we make peace with Saudi Arabia -- it depends on the Saudi leadership -- and bring, effectively, the Arab-Israeli conflict to an end, Netanyahu think we will circle back to the Palestinians and get a workable peace with the Palestinians,"" Netanyahu said.  But with rising and concerning levels of violence from all sides, a far-right Israeli government in place under Netanyahu, and a Palestinian Authority led by an increasingly unpopular President Mahmoud Abbas, that may be an overly optimistic game plan. The digest  US cautions Israel on policies, urges Palestinians to improve governance and accountability  Blinken on Tuesday called for Israelis and Palestinians to de-escalate, stop violence and reduce tensions after a meeting with Abbas in the West Bank. He cautioned against Israeli moves including ""things like settlement expansion, the legalization of [Israeli settler] outposts, demolitions and evictions [of Palestinians from their homes], disruptions to the historic status of the holy sites and of course incitement and acquiescence to violence.""  Background: Blinken's visit comes after Palestinians and Israelis suffered significant bloodshed last week. Thursday was the deadliest day for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank in nearly two years, followed by a shooting near a Jerusalem synagogue Friday night, which Israel has deemed one of its worst terror attacks in recent years. Why it matters: Fears had been growing that the situation in Israel and the West Bank could spiral out of control and Blinken's visit was expected to calm tensions. Blinken asked senior State Department officials to remain in the Middle East to help assist with steps that both Israel and the Palestinians have suggested to him ""to lower the temperature.""  Abu Dhabi's IHC to invest $381 million in Adani Enterprises following damaging short seller report Abu Dhabi's International Holding Company (IHC) on Monday announced that it would invest 1.4 billion dirhams ($381 million) in India's Adani Enterprises' follow-on public offering . The investment comes after the Indian conglomerate's market value plummeted around $70 billion following a damaging short seller report.  Background: This is IHC's first investment of the year, and second investment deal with Adani Group after last year's 7.3 billion dirhams ($2 billion) investment in the group's companies. One of India's largest multinational conglomerates, Adani and its owner Gautam Adani -- one of Asia's richest men -- were caught in the crosshairs of a research firm that accused the conglomerate and Adani himself of pulling off ""the largest con in corporate history."" The report and the selloff it sparked erased some $70 billion in market value across Adani Group companies. Adani said it complied with all local laws and had made the necessary regulatory disclosures. Why it matters: The investment deal comes as IHC aims to increase its global acquisitions by 70% in 2023. Abu Dhabi's largest listed company, IHC's market value more than doubled last year. It is chaired by Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the influential UAE national security adviser and a brother of the UAE's president.  Iran, Russia link banking systems amid Western sanction Iran and Russia have connected their interbank communication and transfer systems to help boost trade and financial transactions, Reuters cited a senior Iranian official as saying on Monday, as both Tehran and Moscow are chafing under Western sanctions. Iran's Central Bank chief Mohammad Farzin welcomed the move. ""The financial channel between Iran and the world is being repaired,"" he tweeted. Background: Since the 2018 reimposition of US sanctions on Iran after Washington ditched Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, the Islamic Republic has been disconnected from the Belgium-based SWIFT financial messaging service, which is a key international banking access point. Similar limitations have been slapped on some Russian banks since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine last year. Why it matters: Since the start of the Ukraine war, Tehran and Moscow have acted to forge close bilateral ties as both capitals attempt to build new economic and diplomatic partnerships elsewhere. With deepening economic misery, many Iranians are feeling the pain of galloping inflation and rising joblessness. Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei said on Monday that the establishment faced ""a tangible welfare and livelihood problem"" that could not be cured without economic growth. 11.4% The turnout in Tunisia's parliamentary runoff elections on Sunday, Reuters cited the country's electoral commission as saying. President Kais Saied on Monday blamed the low turnout on hatred among voters of the parliament, calling it ""an institution of absurdity and a state within the state."" His critics said the turnout was evidence of public disdain for his agenda and seizure of powers, and opposition parties called for his resignation.

An estimated 240 millimeters of rainfall (9.8 inches) -- equal to an entire summer's worth of rain -- fell on Auckland Friday, making it the city's wettest day on record. The rain caused widespread travel disruption over the weekend. More than 2,000 people stayed overnight Friday in the airport's terminals due to the flooding, the airport said. Domestic flights resumed Saturday but the international terminal was not operational until Sunday. Emirates resumed the Auckland route, its longest at 14,200 kilometers (8,800 miles), in December after an almost three-year hiatus due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The flight takes between 16 and 17 hours and is among the world's longest nonstop commercial routes.

(CNN)It was a trajectory -- Washington to Cairo, and then Jerusalem -- similar to the one made nearly a half century earlier by a predecessor of Antony Blinken.Starting in 1974, then-Secretary of State Henry Kissinger's ""shuttle diplomacy"" would bring an accord of sorts and a degree of stability to the region following the catastrophic and bloody Yom Kippur War between Israel and its Arab neighbors. David A. Andelman But it would bring little real, lasting peace.Today, 49 years later, there is still no Palestinian state, relations between Israelis and their Palestinian neighbors are as fraught as ever, blood runs in the streets of both places, and the most obdurate, certainly the most right-wing government in Israeli history has just taken power in Jerusalem. Read MoreOn Tuesday, Blinken wound up three days of meetings with Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. And in the end, it seems, all sides seemed quite content to stand on some long-entrenched and hardly softening positions.As Blinken was winging his way home, Netanyahu told CNN's Jake Tapper in an exclusive interview on Tuesday, ""For 25 years, the Palestinians who don't want peace with Israel, want to see a peace without Israel, who don't want a state next to Israel, but a state instead of Israel --  they had an effective veto on Israel's expansion of the circle of peace around it."" Netanyahu insisted that Netanyahu wants negotiations with the Palestinians, which the Palestinians don't want. Netanyahu also told CNN Netanyahu believed Netanyahu priority of cementing amicable arrangements with all Arab nations, as the Abraham Accords provided, would eventually drive the Palestinians to the peace table, effectively on Netanyahu terms. 'It's all empty promises': Palestinians feel betrayed by US, warn there's only so much they can bear ""If we make peace with Saudi Arabia, [which] depends on the Saudi leadership, and bring effectively the Arab-Israeli conflict to an end, Netanyahu think we'll circle back to the Palestinians and get a workable peace with the Palestinians. Netanyahu think that's possible,"" Netanyahu told Tapper. By contrast, Abbas emerged from his meeting with Blinken and asserted, ""the Israeli Government is responsible for what's happening these days, because of its practices that undermine the two-state solution and violate the signed agreements, and because of the lack of international efforts to dismantle the occupation and the settlement regimes, and the failure to recognize the Palestinian state and its full membership in the United Nations.""Throughout his visit, and especially at its end, Blinken was most careful to treat Palestinians and Israelis even-handedly, promising America's ""support [for] all efforts to move us closer to peace, expand the horizon of hope, advance equal rights and opportunities for Palestinians and Israelis.""   But he was quite clear on the profound challenges in all three cities he'd visited where ""I heard a deep concern about the current trajectory."" And he was equally clear that America continues to support a two-state solution -- independent states of Israelis and Palestinians -- a concept that Palestinians believe is not shared by the Netanyahu government . ""Restoring calm is our immediate task, but over the longer term we have to do more than just lower tensions,"" Blinken explained. ""It's President Biden's firm conviction that the only way to achieve that goal is through preserving and then realizing the vision of two states for two peoples. The United States will continue to oppose anything that puts that goal further from reach, including but not limited to settlement expansion, legalization of illegal outposts, a move towards annexation of the West Bank, disruption to the historic status quo on Jerusalem's holy sites, demolitions and evictions, and incitement and acquiescence to violence.""Quite a heavy lift considering what Netanyahu told Tapper.Netanyahu outlines vision for two-state solution -- without Palestinian sovereignty   Indeed, it would seem that the government Netanyahu leads is determined to press forward on initiatives only calculated to inflame passions on both sides. Netanyahu public security minister, Itamar Ben Gvir, has been convicted for inciting anti-Arab racism. While Aryeh Deri, leader of the ultra-Orthodox Sephardi party Shas, was forced to step down as interior minister by the nation's high court, he is expected to return after Netanyahuruling coalition pledged Netanyahu support.At the same time, the right-wing dominated Knesset awarded to Bezalel Smotrich -- a religious-Zionist leader of the settler movement -- supervision of the Jewish territories that Palestinians have long claimed for themselves. Passions continued to rise, as an Israeli army raid on the Jenin refugee camp last week left 10 Palestinians dead and was followed by an attack by a Palestinian gunman on a Jerusalem synagogue that left seven dead. In the past week at least 22 people have been killed in violent incidents.  Amid such a tense atmosphere it seems unlikely that some key Middle East nations, particularly Saudi Arabia, will have any incentive to establish a working relationship with Israel that could lead to a lasting peace. At Davos, before the latest deadly confrontations between Israelis and Palestinians, Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud told the World Economic Forum, ""Palestine remains an important evocative issue in our region... the focus really needs to be on a pathway to resolving this conflict."" Netanyahu clearly has staked out consistent priorities that could make any such accommodation unlikely. ""Israel should have the overriding security responsibility [for Israeli territories] because every time we moved out, say from Lebanon, basically Iran came in with its proxy Hezbollah,"" Netanyahu told CNN. ""We moved out of Gaza and other radical Islamists, Hamas, took over. And if we just walk away as people suggest, then you'll have Hamas and Iran move into the hills around Jerusalem, overlooking Tel Aviv.""

But if the overarching purpose of Blinken's visit was to engage with the government of Netanyahu -- who has had a longstanding, sometimes fraught relationship with President Biden -- without burning any new bridges, then the Secretary of State may have left in the nick of time.  In April, as they often do, Ramadan and Passover will overlap. A recipe for another round of a conflict that is little closer to resolution. Still, as Netanyahu pointed out to Tapper, and negotiators harking back to Kissinger have recognized, deeply flawed though Israel may be, it is the only working democracy in the Middle East.  The US has little alternative, then, to support it and do its best to hold up a mirror to its faults, praying it will do the right thing for all who live within its borders and abroad.

5," (CNN)Israel carried out airstrikes in Gaza early on Thursday after intercepting a rocket attack from the coastal enclave, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said.In a Twitter post, the IDF said Israeli fighter jets targeted a chemical production site and a weapons manufacturing facility owned by Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that runs Gaza. ""The IDF holds Hamas responsible for all terrorism activity emanating from Gaza and it will face the consequences of the security violations against Israel,"" the IDF wrote.On Wednesday, the IDF reported that one rocket fired from Gaza had been intercepted by the IDF Aerial Defense Array.On Thursday, it released two videos of the airstrikes, filmed in black and white, that showed huge plumes of dark smoke in the air and pieces of debris falling to the ground.Read MoreIt's not clear whether there were any casualties.The official Palestinian News & Information Agency reported that F-16 warplanes had launched at least five missiles at a ""site"" in the central Gaza Strip, setting it on fire and damaging nearby homes. Two missiles also hit agricultural land in the central area, it said.The strike comes after a period of bloodshed on both sides. Last Thursday Israeli forces killed nine Palestinians and wounded several others in the West Bank city of Jenin, in the deadliest day for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank in nearly two years. This was followed by a shooting near a Jerusalem synagogue Friday night, which Israel has deemed one of its worst terror attacks in recent years.Lethal Israeli raid marks deadliest day in over a yearIt also follows US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's trip to Israel and the West Bank this week, which some had hoped would help cool rising tensions.

His corner stand at the heart of Ramallah is always busy, no matter the weather, but his future as a Palestinian is very much as gloomy as the skies above. ""I am 40 years old and I keep seeing the same thing. Many leaderships have come and gone and the situation remains the same,"" he says. Despite US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas just a few hilly kilometers away on Tuesday, A'asem says he is sure Palestinians are not a priority for Washington.  ""His visit is only intended for Israel,"" he says. ""It's just good manners to pass by since he is in the neighborhood.""Blinken's visit came in a month that has seen the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli security forces at an eight-year-high. Ten of those deaths occurred because of a raid by Israeli forces in Jenin on Thursday. Tensions quickly spiraled and the next day, a Palestinian man shot and killed seven Israelis outside a synagogue. Exclusive: Netanyahu says don't get 'hung up' on peace with Palestinians firstRead MoreFriday night's shooting attack took place in the Israeli settlement of Neve Yaakov, an area Israel considers to be a neighborhood of Jerusalem, but which is deemed illegally occupied land by most of the international community.Blinken sought to lower the temperature, even before he arrived in Israel, while reinforcing the US ironclad commitment to Israeli security. He also said the US, specifically the Biden administration, remains committed to a two-state solution.Speaking alongside Abbas in Ramallah, Blinken said it was necessary first ""to take steps to de-escalate, to stop the violence, to reduce tensions, and to try as well to create the foundation for more positive actions going forward.""But that, he said, was ""not sufficient"" by itself. ""It's also important to continue to strive not only for reducing violence but ensuring that ultimately Israelis and Palestinians alike enjoy the same rights, the same opportunities. What we're seeing now from Palestinians is a shrinking horizon of hope, not an expanding one, and that, too, we believe needs to change.""US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas clasp hands in Ramallah on Tuesday, January 31, 2023.Yet A'asem is not putting his faith in the United States' top diplomat.""He might offer us something here and there but it's all empty promises,"" he says. ""Since day one of the occupation it's the same promises and same things and they are failure and empty promises."" Down the road, the smell of cashews and almonds being roasted at Rifa'at Yousuf's shop cuts through the cold winter air. He too is not optimistic. ""It's gone from bad to worse,"" Yousuf, 44, says of US policy towards Palestinians. ""(Blinken's) visit is not welcome for us Palestinians,"" he adds, accusing the secretary of state of enabling Israeli occupation and supporting what he says are Israel's violent actions in the occupied West Bank. ""We, as Palestinian people, we are against any visit from anyone who supports Israel in this way.""Blinken visit reaches new urgency as Israeli, Palestinian tensions boil Israeli Prime Minister Benajmin Netanyahu vowed this week that Israel would ""strengthen"" settlements in response to the shooting attacks in Jerusalem, a position Blinken cautioned against on Tuesday.But speaking with CNN's Jake Tapper on Tuesday, Netanyahu said people can get ""hung up"" on peace negotiations with the Palestinians, saying Netanyahu has opted for a different approach. ""When effectively the Arab-Israeli conflict (comes) to an end, Netanyahu think we'll circle back to the Palestinians and get a workable peace with the Palestinians,"" Netanyahu said.Asked what concessions Israel would grant Palestinian territories, Netanyahu responded: ""Well, Netanyahu'm certainly willing to have them have all the powers that they need to govern themselves. But none of the powers that could threaten (us) and this means that Israel should have the overriding security responsibility.""JUST Netanyahu on peace process: 'We're going to have to live together'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST Netanyahu on peace process: 'We're going to have to live together' 03:29The disillusionment, hopelessness and the feeling of abandonment is difficult to swallow for most in Ramallah, but it's especially tough for the Palestinian youth, who see no future for their people or themselves. ""We are very upset,"" 18-year-old Nihad Omar says. ""Every day we see someone become a martyr or a prisoner, it's the same cycle and the numbers just keep increasing, they are not going down.""Analysts on both sides say the Israeli government's promises that it will respond to violence with an ""iron fist,"" coupled with the despair felt by many in Gaza and the West Bank, have turned the region into a powder keg with an ever-shortening fuse. Echoing that feeling, Omar says there's only so much pressure Palestinians can and are willing to bear.""The occupation is surrounding us from all over and not letting the Palestinian people breathe,"" he says. Hanan Ashwari, a Palestinian rights advocate and former member of the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization, says the frustration with the United States and Israel felt by those CNN spoke with is valid, and very much widespread through Ramallah and the West Bank. ""(Blinken) wants to integrate Israel in the region, which means, you know, sideline the Palestinians, reward Israel and normalize the occupation,"" Ashwari says. ""Then they talk about being in favor of two-state solution, they pat themselves on the shoulder and they go home.""That's very ironic, because they stood aside and they allowed Israel to destroy the two-state solution by destroying the Palestinian state, stealing land, killing people, demolishing homes, and terrorizing, through settlers and the army, the Palestinians,"" she adds. The disillusionment, Ashwari says, is not just with the United States, but also with the current Palestinian leadership. ""We have had a leadership that is not just rhetoric but has held on to positions of power and has failed in many ways to deliver to the people even its own policies,"" she explains. ""I think it is time to have elections and to have a new leadership chosen by the people enjoying the legitimacy of the election.""Mourners take part in the funeral of Palestinians who were killed in an Israeli raid in Jenin, in the occupied West Bank, on January 26, 2023.Most we spoke with in Ramallah agree. ""The Palestinian leadership tries to appease the Palestinian people and bring good, but they are handicapped and incapable of delivering,"" Omar says. ""The people who are around [current Palestinian Authority President] Mahmoud Abbas are unfortunately more cooperative with the Israelis than him,"" Yousuf says. ""I wish we had someone with the spirit Yasser Arafat had.""But some do still give Netanyahu and Netanyahu leadership some credit. ""The Palestinian leadership tries to bring solutions for the Palestinian people, but they face many challenges,"" coffee-stand owner A'asem says. Those challenges to a more prosperous Palestinian future, including the establishment of a Palestinian state, they say are roadblocks purposefully put in place by Israeli politicians. For Ashwari, Israeli policies towards Palestinians, now enacted by what is the most right-wing government in the country's history, are slowly but surely destroying the viability of a two-state solution. ""Israel is making sure there is no viable sovereign Palestinian state by expanding settlements, stealing more land,"" Ashwari says. ""This is unacceptable. The more settlements you build, the less land you have for the Palestinians.""On the streets of Ramallah, Palestinians are acutely aware of that reality. ""We hope for a two-state solution but what we see on the horizon and what we see on the ground there is nothing to indicate a two-state solution [is viable],"" Yousuf says. ""Palestinians don't have power or opinion or choice, the two-state solution is only words, we aspire for a two-state solution, but this is becoming a dream, an unrealistic dream.""""There won't be a two-state solution,"" Omar agrees. ""With the Israeli occupiers never.""As he brews another pot of coffee, a pensive A'asem realises the dream of a Palestinian state doesn't seem to be getting any closer. ""Maybe the two state (solution) has become an unrealistic dream,"" he concedes, seemingly heartbroken by the acknowledgment.But that sense of defeat is only a momentary lapse before a fiery comeback. ""We Palestinians, we are an emotional people, we are generous, and we will be generous to the Jewish people when they come as guests,"" he says. ""But with an occupier there will never be peace.""

CryptoA record $3.8 billion worth of cryptocurrency was stolen from various services last year, according to a report published Wednesday. The increase in crypto heists, from $3.3 billion in 2021, came as the overall market for cryptocurrencies suffered significant declines. Some of the biggest thefts were driven by North Korean-linked hackers, blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis said in the report. US officials worry Pyongyang will use money stolen from crypto hacks to fund its illicit nuclear and ballistic weapons program. North Korean hackers have stolen the equivalent of billions of dollars in recent years by raiding cryptocurrency exchanges, according to the UN.
