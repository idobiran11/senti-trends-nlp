He has refused to step down and has used his office as a bully pulpit against critics and the criminal justice system.At Monday's hearing, Netanyahu's lawyers submitted a written response pleading not guilty. They then argued against the cases on procedural grounds, saying the attorney general had not properly approved the investigations in writing.After around 20 minutes, Netanyahu left the courtroom without explanation and his motorcade departed.The hearing continued in his absence, with his lawyers arguing for more than an hour that constitutional procedures had not been followed. The judges appeared skeptical and repeatedly called on the defense lawyers to wrap it up.

He said that Biden had more pressing priorities to contend with, such as fallout for the coronavirus pandemic. Former President Trump’s Israel policy was in lockstep with Netanyahu, but the Israeli leader could have a frostier relationship with Biden.

The crew was unharmed, but the vessel sustained two holes on its port side and two on its starboard side just above the waterline, according to American defense officials. The ship came to Dubai’s port for repairs on Sunday, days after the blast that revived security concerns in Mideast waterways amid heightened tensions with Iran. Iran has sought to pressure the U.S. to lift sanctions on Tehran as President Joe Biden's administration considers options for returning to negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program. Biden has said repeatedly the U.S. would return to the nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers that his predecessor, Donald Trump, withdrew from in 2018 only after Iran restores its full compliance with the accord. The explosion on the Israeli-owned ship last week recalled the tense summer of 2019, when the U.S. military accused Iran of attacking several oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman with limpet mines, designed to be attached magnetically to a ship’s hull. The Gulf of Oman leads through the narrow Strait of Hormuz, a vital passage for the world’s oil supplies.

The vessel had discharged cars at various ports in the Persian Gulf before the explosion forced it to reverse course. Over the weekend, Israel’s defense minister and army chief had both indicated they held Iran responsible for what they said was an attack on the vessel. Iran responded to Netanyahu's statement saying it ""strongly rejected"" the claim that it was behind the attack. In a press briefing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said Netanyahu was ""suffering from an obsession with Iran"" and described his charges as ""fear-mongering."" Khatibzadeh also accused Israel of taking ""suspicious actions in the region"" against Iran in recent months to undermine the 2015 nuclear deal, without elaborating, and vowed Iran would respond. ""Israel knows very well that our response in the field of national security has always been fierce and accurate,"" he said.   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu talks to the media on Feb. 20.

Iran and its Lebanese proxy Hezbollah have provided military support to Syrian President Bashar Assad in the more than decade-long Syrian civil war. The Israeli military declined comment. Iran also has blamed Israel for a recent series of attacks, including another mysterious explosion last summer that destroyed an advanced centrifuge assembly plant at its Natanz nuclear facility and the killing of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, a top Iranian scientist who founded the Islamic Republic’s military nuclear program two decades ago.

Just days prior, Netanyahu had blamed Iran for a mysterious explosion that impacted an Israeli-owned cargo ship in the Gulf of Oman last week.The incident was just the latest to inflame tensions between the two nations and came as Harris appears to be moving toward a significant role in foreign policy.According to Politico, Harris is trying to carve out a specialty in foreign policy and is taking on responsibilities like solo meetings with foreign leaders.VP KAMALA HARRIS HOLDS CALLS WITH FOREIGN LEADERS WITHOUT BIDENShe also participated in the first bilateral meeting of the new administration between Canada and the United States. Biden reportedly didn't do the same as vice president in the Obama administration.She has spoken to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison.In February, President Biden also spoke with Netanyahu about Iran and working to advance peace in the region.According to Harris' office, she reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to partnering with Israel and supporting its security. ""Vice President Kamala Harris spoke today by phone with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, and underscored the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to the U.S.-Israel partnership,"" a release read.""The Vice President emphasized the United States’ unwavering commitment to Israel’s security. She expressed strong support for Israel’s recent groundbreaking normalization agreements with countries in the Arab and Muslim world, and stressed the importance of advancing peace, security, and prosperity for Israelis and Palestinians alike.""CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIt added: ""The Vice President and Prime Minister agreed on the importance of continuing close cooperation and partnership on regional security issues, including Iran’s nuclear program and the regime’s dangerous regional behavior,"" a release from Harris' office read.

He called the occasion a ""festival of democracy.""   Coronavirus patients cast their ballots Tuesday at a special drive-through polling station in Israel. (Eitan Elhadez/TPS) BLINKEN SAYS TRUMP-ERA PEACE DEALS WERE A ‘VERY GOOD THING’ ""This is the moment of truth for the state of Israel,"" said his rival Yair Lapid as he voted in Tel Aviv. One truth: Israelis are weary of the do-overs. The balloting, like Israel's world-leading vaccination campaign, got good reviews for organization — if only because everyone involved has had lots of practice, with the potential of even more if the results don't produce a governing majority. That answer might not be clear for weeks. ""It would be better if we didn’t have to vote, you know, four times in two years,"" said Jerusalem resident Bruce Rosen after casting his ballot. ""It’s a little bit tiring."" Candidates made their final push in recent days with a series of TV interviews and public appearances at shopping malls and outdoor marketplaces. The campaigns increasingly reached into people's personal space with a constant barrage of get-out-and-vote texts that made cell phones ding and buzz at all hours. At issue more than ideology is Netanyahu, Israel's longest-serving prime minister. With analysts predicting a lower turnout than last year's election, he campaigned throughout Tuesday, at one point using a megaphone to tell people at a beach south of Tel Aviv to go vote, according to footage on his Facebook page.   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara cast their ballots at a polling station as Israelis vote in a general election in Jerusalem on Tuesday. (AP) ISRAELI EXPERTS DISCOVER NEW DEAD SEA SCROLLS Netanyahu has portrayed himself as a global statesman uniquely qualified to lead the country through its many security and diplomatic challenges. He has made Israel's successful coronavirus-vaccination campaign the centerpiece of his reelection bid, and pointed to last year's diplomatic agreements with four Arab states. The reality is more nuanced. Some 80% of the nation’s adults are vaccinated and Israel is reopening, but more than 6,000 have died of COVID-19. Israel came under international criticism for failing to quickly send significant quantities of vaccines to Palestinians to fight the virus’ surge in the West Bank and Gaza. And one of the four Arab nations, the United Arab Emirates, recently poured cold water on the relationship with Israel because its leaders did not want Netanyahu to draw them into electioneering. The new administration of President Joe Biden, too, has given Netanyahu a cool reception. Opponents accuse Netanyahu of bungling the management of the coronavirus pandemic for most of the past year. They say he failed to enforce lockdown restrictions on his ultra-Orthodox political allies, allowing the virus to spread, and point to the still-dire state of the economy and its double-digit unemployment rate. They also say Netanyahu is unfit to rule at a time when he is on trial for multiple corruption charges, a case he dismisses as a witch hunt. Up to 15% of the electorate is expected to vote outside their home districts, a batch of absentee balloting that’s larger than usual to accommodate those with coronavirus or in quarantine. The government is dispatching special polling stations, including bringing voting boxes to patients' bedsides, to provide ways for them to cast ballots safely.   COVID-19 patient Rahamim Havura votes for Israel's parliamentary election inside an intensive care ward for coronavirus patients at Ichilov Hospital in Tel Aviv, Israel, on Tuesday. (AP) KAMALA HARRIS SPEAKS WITH NETANYAHU Those votes are tallied separately in Jerusalem, meaning final results may not be known for days. Given the tight race, the large number of undecided voters and a number of small parties struggling to cross the 3.25% threshold for entry into parliament, it could be difficult to predict the outcome before the final count is complete. The nearly constant campaigning has a price, said Israel's president. ""Four elections in two years erode public trust in the democratic process,"" Reuven Rivlin said as he cast his ballot in Jerusalem, urging Israeli's to cast theirs yet again. ""There is no other way."" Israelis vote for parties, not individual candidates. No single party list of candidates has been able to form a governing majority in Israel’s 72-year history. Netanyahu’s Likud party and those led by his rivals will be looking to smaller, allied parties as potential coalition partners. The party that can cobble together a majority coalition gets to form the next government — a process that is expected to take weeks. Tuesday’s election was sparked by the disintegration of an emergency government formed last May between Netanyahu and his chief rival. The alliance was plagued by infighting, and elections were triggered by the government’s failure in December to agree on a budget.   An Ultra-Orthodox Jewish man arrives to vote for Israel's parliamentary election at a polling station in Bnei Brak, Israel, on Tuesday. (AP) NETANYAHU SLAMS ‘OUTRAGEOUS’ ANTI-SEMITIC JOKE BY ‘SNL’ STAR Netanyahu is hoping to form a government with his traditional religious and hard-line nationalist allies. These include a pair of ultra-Orthodox parties and a small religious party that includes openly racist and homophobic candidates. Netanyahu’s rivals have accused him of causing the past two years of paralysis in hopes of forming a more favorable government that would grant him immunity or protect him from prosecution. His challengers include Yair Lapid, Israel’s opposition leader whose Yesh Atid party has emerged as the main centrist alternative to Netanyahu. Lapid reflected the race's stark rhetoric Tuesday when he offered himself as an alternative to a ""government of darkness and racism."" Netanyahu also faces challenges from a number of onetime allies who have formed their own parties after bitter break-ups with the prime minister.   Yesh Atid party leader Yair Lapid leaves after he voted for Israel's parliamentary election at a polling station in Tel Aviv, Israel, on Tuesday. (AP) US FLIES B-52 BOMBERS OVER MIDEAST AGAIN AMID TENSIONS WITH IRAN They include former protege Gideon Saar, who broke away from Likud to form ""New Hope."" He says the party is a nationalist alternative unburdened by corruption charges and what he says is a cult of personality that keeps Likud in power. ""Today we have the opportunity to exit deadlock,"" Saar said as he cast his ballot in Tel Aviv. Yamina party leader Naftali Bennett, another former Netanyahu aide, could emerge as the kingmaker. A hard-line nationalist politician who was formerly Netanyahu’s education and defense minister, Bennett has not ruled out joining a coalition with the embattled prime minister, allowing him to court both sides in future coalition talks. The personality politics have so overtaken the race that there’s been almost no mention of the Palestinians, after years of frozen peace talks. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Unlike last year’s elections, the prime minister is without one key ally: former President Donald Trump, whose support he leveraged in previous elections with massive billboards on highways and high-rises showing them together. In contrast, Netanyahu has barely mentioned Biden. The new U.S. president called the prime minister only after reaching out to leaders of several other countries and Israel’s supporters began to complain that the delay smacked of a snub. The two men insist their alliance remains close.   ",2021-03-08 02:33:00

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.Israel’s president on Tuesday handed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu the difficult task of trying to form a government from the country’s splintered parliament, giving the embattled leader a chance to prolong his lengthy term in office while on trial for corruption charges.In his announcement, President Reuven Rivlin acknowledged that no party leader had the necessary support to form a majority coalition in the 120-seat Knesset. He also noted that many believe Netanyahu is unfit to serve in light of his legal problems.ISRAEL TROUBLED BY AMERICAN STANCE TOWARD IRAN: REPORTNonetheless, Rivlin said that there was nothing in the law preventing Netanyahu from serving as prime minister. After consulting with the 13 parties in the newly elected parliament, Rivlin said that Netanyahu had the best chance of any candidate of forming a new government.""No candidate has a realistic chance of forming a government that will have the confidence of the Knesset,"" Rivlin said. But, he added, Netanyahu has a ""slightly higher chance"" of being able to.""I have decided to entrust him with the task,"" Rivlin said from Jerusalem. Rivlin added that the choice was ""not an easy decision on a moral and ethical basis.""

(Abir Sultan/Pool Photo via AP) With that, Rivlin nudged forward the twin dramas over the country’s future and Netanyahu’s fate, giving Israel’s longest-serving premier a fresh chance to try to salvage his career. Netanyahu now has up to six weeks to try to cobble together a coalition during his trial.Early reactions from the premier’s sworn rivals highlighted the difficult road ahead.Yair Lapid, leader of the party that won the second-highest number of seats, acknowledged that the law left Rivlin ""no choice,"" but in the same tweet denounced the development as ""a shameful disgrace that tarnishes Israel.""A court ruling could be months or even years away. The proceedings are expected to take place up to three days a week, an embarrassing and time-consuming distraction that will shadow Netanyahu’s appeals to his rivals.PALESTINIAN CHRISTIANS IN THE GAZA STRIP CELEBRATE EASTER AMID COVID-19 OUTBREAKNetanyahu holds the most support — 52 seats — in Israel’s Knesset. But that is still short of a 61-seat majority. He is likely to use his powers of persuasion to try to lure a number of opponents, including a number of former close aides who have vowed never to serve under him again, with generous offers of powerful government ministries or legislative committees.Parties representing 45 members supported Yair Lapid, while Yamina, with seven seats, nominated its own leader, Naftali Bennett. Three parties holding a total of 16 seats made no recommendation.Rivlin’s decision merges questions of Netanyahu’s legal and political future in what’s perhaps the starkest political challenge of his career. VideoIn court, he faces fraud, breach of trust and bribery charges in three separate cases. Proceedings resumed Tuesday, though the premier was not expected to appear in court.A key witness on Monday cast Netanyahu as an image-obsessed leader who forced a prominent news site to help his family and smear his opponents.Netanyahu denies all charges and in an nationally televised address accused prosecutors of persecuting him in an effort to drive him out of office.""This is what a coup attempt looks like,"" he said.CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APPMonday’s court session focused on the most serious case against Netanyahu — in which he is accused of promoting regulations that delivered hundreds of millions of dollars of profits to the Bezeq telecom company in exchange for positive coverage on the firm’s popular news site, Walla.Ilan Yeshua, Walla’s former chief editor, described a system in which Bezeq’s owners, Shaul and Iris Elovitch, repeatedly pressured him to publish favorable things about Netanyahu and smear the prime minister’s rivals.The explanation he was given by the couple?

Andrew Cuomo of sexual harassment, provided a photo of the incident.""SANDREW"" was the perfect couple. The beautiful and warm TV cooking-show star softened the gruff, hard-charging governor’s sharp edges. Her telegenic smile seemed to transform his perpetual scowl.During their 14 years together Sandra Lee never publicly criticized her life partner, and Andrew Cuomo gushed about the ""godsend"" who helped him raise his three daughters. When she became sick with cancer, he was seen as a loving fixture by her side.In September 2019, the fairytale romance suddenly unraveled and a disbelieving public clamored to know why. Now, as a tornado of sexual-harassment charges swirls around Cuomo, the first clues may be emerging.Lee, ever composed, remains outwardly stoic and above the fray — even as multiple sources told The Post they suspect ­Cuomo was cheating on her with at least one staffer and possibly several.BEFORE DIVORCING CUOMO, RFK'S DAUGHTER SLEPT INSIDE LOCKED BATHROOM, BIOGRAPHER CLAIMS""Sandra’s gone silent and her silence is deafening,"" said the insider. ""The question is, is Sandra being silent out of grace and dignity, or is she being silenced out of fear of retaliation?"" Lee did not comment.Cuomo told The Post: ""Any suggestion that I had a sexual relationship with any member of my staff or that I was unfaithful to Sandy is false.""""Any suggestion that I had a sexual relationship with any member of my staff or that I was unfaithful to Sandy is false."" — New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo  Gov. Andrew Cuomo, D-N.Y., is accompanied by his girlfriend Sandra Lee as they arrive for a state dinner at the White House in Washington, Oct. 18, 2016. (Associated Press) Following the devastating breakup, Lee, 54, started a new life in Malibu, Calif. She refused to speak to The Post about her relationship with Cuomo, 63, or the ugly allegations that have led to a state investigation and calls for impeachment.Still, reports and investigations into whether Cuomo sexually harassed staffers in and around the workplace have raised questions about how his alleged behavior affected his last long-term relationship, and if his pursuit of other women could have contributed to the mysterious break-up.CNN GOES ALL WEEK AVOIDING LATEST CUOMO SCANDALS; SKIPS 9TH ACCUSER, 'VIP' COVID TESTING, BOOK CONTROVERSYThe Post also spoke to staffers who claimed that Lee was kept at arm’s-length while Cuomo spent time with favored colleagues around the clock. And the allegations from female staffers of improper flirting, touching and comments going back 21 years have raised questions about whether Cuomo was faithful during his relationship with Lee.'Andrew is toxic'""Andrew is toxic. There’s obviously a reason why Sandra moved to California — she literally could not have moved farther away from Andrew. She’s on the edge of the Pacific,"" the insider added.A former senior Cuomo staffer said ominously: ""Andrew’s treatment of Sandra is part of the puzzle that will finalize the picture about this guy."" VideoSources told The Post how Cuomo threw boozy parties at the pool house in the governor’s mansion and ""movie nights"" attended by female staffers, all without Lee, who often traveled to the West Coast to care for her family.While it is possible that such events were innocent — if awkward — morale-building exercises for the many staffers (male and female) in attendance, these details form part of the pattern that emerged after former staffers spoke out about inappropriate behavior where lines between Cuomo’s personal and professional lives became blurred.CUOMO BEGGED AIDE MELISSA DEROSA TO STAY AFTER SHE WANTED TO RESIGN, LAWMAKER SAYSFive former Cuomo staffers told The Post they are convinced he became involved, or pursued intimate relationships, with a small number of staffers while living with Lee.""It was an open secret,"" said one ex-aide. ""Andrew was sleeping with at least one other woman who wasn’t Sandra"" before they officially ended their relationship.""Andrew was sleeping with at least one other woman who wasn’t Sandra."" — Former Cuomo aideA second former staffer told how State Troopers who came to pick up Cuomo one morning at the home Cuomo and Lee shared in Mount Kisco, Westchester, were stunned to see him leave the house with a staffer. Asked if it was possible they had been working, the former staffer said it was doubtful: ""There was no reason for this woman to be there so early.""Cuomo, through a spokesman, denied any staffer ever spent the night at the Mount Kisco house, saying that occasionally staffers would meet him at the house in the morning so they could join his entourage for a ride to an event or meeting.  New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Sandra Lee attend ""RX: Early Detection A Cancer Journey With Sandra Lee"" New York screening at HBO Theater on Oct. 2, 2018 in New York City. (Getty Images) Staffers also raised questions about Cuomo’s travel arrangements. When Cuomo traveled to Jerusalem in March 2017, a third former staffer claimed the governor and a female staffer were booked into linked, adjoining rooms. Although this could have been entirely innocent, the source said suspicions were raised when official logs were changed to show a State Police officer staying in the adjacent room. Cuomo claims this was ac­cidental.""On trips, as a rule, only State Police security or advance staff were assigned to adjoining rooms with the governor — when I saw that the hotel had made a room assignment not keeping with that rule, I switched rooms so that I was in the adjoining room and the other staff person was moved across the hall,"" said Steve Cannon, who was the lead advance person on March 2017 Israel trip.NY STATE ASSEMBLY OPENS TIP LINE FOR INFORMATION ON CUOMO ALLEGATIONSCuomo denied any liaisons during the Israel trip, and his spokesman provided a busy travel itinerary that showed Cuomo had ­almost no free time. VideoHowever, the document showed that he had a room at the King David Hotel, and a scheduling gap between a 7 p.m. meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his 12:45 a.m. flight home. Cuomo’s office claimed the extra time was spent with Israeli media. The Israel part of the weekly schedule — unlike other days of the week where every event or meeting appeared with a list of names of staffers present — fails to list any member of his ­entourage.""There was no sleep over on this trip — according to our records, after meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the governor and the state delegation arrived back at the hotel around 8.15pm, the governor then had dinner with prominent media officials in the lobby before departing for the airport at 9.45pm,"" Azzopardi said.Through a back doorIt wasn’t just geographical distance that may have pushed Lee and Cuomo apart. During the relationship, former staffers described how Cuomo would tell his office not to let Lee know where he was as he enjoyed drinks late at night at Docks, a seafood restaurant in the same building as the governor’s Midtown office, with senior female staff. After entering through a back door leading from the office building to a private room, Cuomo would hold court, according to the former staffers.The flood of accusations from former staffers accusing Cuomo of inappropriate behavior in social scenarios (which he largely denies) raises questions about whether any of these round-the-clock interactions led to romantic relationships.CUOMO FACES ETHICS COMPLAINT FROM WATCHDOG GROUP OVER BOOK PROMOTION BY CAMPAIGNCuomo is notoriously secretive about his life and tightly controls what is revealed about his personal and working relationships, as evidenced by his continuing use of a BlackBerry, sources said. Even though Cuomo’s office announced in November 2019 that staffers’ BlackBerrys were being phased out for iPhones, the governor still uses one. According to Politico, Cuomo preferred BlackBerry’s PIN-to-PIN messaging system to avoid paper trails. A former staffer told The Post: ""Andrew was extremely security-conscious; if he was doing anything, you would not be able to find it out.""""Andrew was extremely security-conscious; if he was doing anything, you would not be able to find it out."" — Former Cuomo stafferAside from the suspicion of romantic relationships, Cuomo also cultivated a ""mean girls"" atmosphere inside his office where he allowed his staff to make fun of Lee — and encouraged them to hide his calendar from her and prevent her from joining him at events.Former aide Ana Liss, one of the parade of ­Cuomo accusers — who told The Wall Street Journal how the governor ""asked her if she had a boyfriend, called her sweetheart, touched her on her lower back at a reception and once kissed her hand when she rose from her desk"" — confirmed to The Post that Lee was deliberately kept away from Cuomo’s diary by staffers, including top current aide Melissa DeRosa and current Director of the Governor’s Offices Stephanie Benton.""My understanding is that Sandra was viewed . . . as merely an accessory,"" she said.Cuomo’s office countered that ""the office e-mailed Sandra a schedule each night of the governor’s movements for the following day.""Liss continued, ""I know from my time working there that Sandra was very clearly kept away from Andrew by the folks controlling his schedule. She was only brought forth in public on certain special occasions. Given the lack of frequency of their time spent together publicly and privately, it had a performative nature about it. It felt like watching Princess Diana. She [Sandra] is a beautiful, statuesque woman who complemented the governor’s gruffness.""Sandra was very clearly kept away from Andrew by the folks controlling his schedule."" — Ana Liss, a Cuomo accuser""She never stayed at the mansion that I was aware of,"" said Liss, who added that it ""did strike me as odd that he was rarely at home with her.""Cuomo spokesman Richard Azzopardi said Lee did in fact spend time at the Albany mansion, just as Cuomo spent plenty of time at Lily Pond, the colonial-style Westchester estate where Lee had made a home for them. Azzopardi added that Cuomo did not have a Manhattan apartment.""It was Sandra’s forever home, her dream home,"" Liss said. ""But as a staff member for two years, I monitored Andrew’s schedule every day, to know what he was doing and focused on. He spent most of his time in Manhattan.""During scheduling calls, the ex-senior staffer recalled, ""I would ask whether Sandra was going on a trip with Andrew, and all the mean girls like Stephanie Benton and [current Cuomo director of scheduling] Annabel Walsh would start laughing and say nothing. They would be rolling their eyes.""One of the last times ""that Sandra attended an event with Andrew was the Pride Parade in the city in June 2018. She loved coming and it was a really important event to her.""And people from the office were hostile, they totally ignored her. She had her sunglasses on the whole time and looked so sad.""Andrew humiliates people, one way or another.""""Andrew humiliates people, one way or another."" — Ana Liss, a Cuomo accuser Walsh and Benton did not return messages seeking comment.The Governor’s Office denied Sandra was ill-treated by staff. ""Sandra was very much part of the family and the office has nothing but respect for her,"" Azzopardi said.Away from Lee, Cuomo threw pool bashes that Liss described as turning into nights of boozing, although Cuomo’s rep stresses that the governor does not drink.Speaking about the pool-house parties, the former senior staffer said: ""I attended them, You had to go — it was a sign you were senior in the administration.""Although the staffer never saw any sexual activity, she found the arrangement uncomfortable. ""They were so awkward, everyone standing around like court jesters, and Andrew would be watching you, he had a photographer there, even though it was ­basically an internal staff meeting — it was creepy beyond belief.""And I’m certain that the same collection of people — his favorites — slept over there. Imagine how that looks to the rest of the office.""Movie-night sleepoverOn one occasion, Cuomo invited four female staffers to a movie-night sleepover at the mansion, the ex-senior staffer said.Azzopardi said any informal gatherings at the governor’s mansion, whether inside watching movies or having a meal and drinks in the pool house, were family-friendly and co-ed and never resulted in guests staying the night.  New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is seen outside his home last month. (Reuters) Despite the extracurricular activities and the pattern of questionable behavior at work alleged by no less than seven women, Cuomo was famously portrayed as the doting boyfriend when Lee was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2015 and underwent a grueling double mastectomy.Privately, those who worked for him pondered whether he was merely using his partner’s illness as a publicity stunt.Cuomo even appeared wearing a mask and scrubs alongside Lee, who documented every aspect of her illness — from diagnosis to surgery and recovery — on camera for her HBO documentary ""Rx: Early Detection, A Cancer Journey with Sandra Lee.""""After Sandy decided to make her breast-cancer diagnosis public, she and the governor vowed to fight for New York families together — it was a terribly painful time for the entire family and for someone to try to distort that is just wrong,"" said Azzopardi.In his 2014 book, ""All Things Possible: Setbacks and Success in Politics,"" Cuomo gushed about Lee, writing: ""Why she got involved with me I don’t know. I was not much of a catch. But Sandy was. Smart, successful and gorgeous, she had launched her flagship show, ‘Semi-Homemade Cooking with Sandra Lee,’ a few years earlier. She has enormous appeal to viewers and to readers of her books and magazine, who lead busy lives and to put good food on the table quickly. No marketing gimmick, her ‘smart and simple’ approach grew out of her hardscrabble beginnings: the eldest of five children, with an abusive mother and stepfather, Sandy had to shop and cook for the household and take care of her siblings — on welfare and food stamps — starting when she was 12 . . . more than a catch, Sandy was a godsend."" VideoHe also praised her for being ""an exquisitely kind, loving and nurturing person with an uncommon ability to connect with people. She was adept at taking care of three young girls as I was not. My children took to her immediately, and as they’ve grown older, she has been a significant presence in their lives. We have made a family.""Liss said of the cancer drama: ""By that time, I wasn’t working in the Governor’s Office, but those of us not there who were still in touch speculated that he was using it as a p.r. stunt, something to add to his credibility as a man and politician who is a proclaimed feminist — even though internally within the workplace that he oversaw he was very much not pro-woman.""An insider close to the couple observed of Cuomo’s workplace behavior: ""If someone acts this badly in the office 12 hours a day, how do they come home and turn into Mr. Wonderful unless they are Jekyll and Hyde?""Cuomo’s latest accuser, Sherry Vill, said Cuomo forcibly kissed her cheeks and made her uncomfortable while examining flood damage at her home. Other accusations range from groping a woman under her shirt and planting unwanted kisses, to asking inappropriate questions about sex and dating.The Democratic governor has said he ""never touched anyone inappropriately"" and ""never made any inappropriate advances,"" and that no one ever told him at the time that he was making them uncomfortable. He has called some allegations false but apologized if his overly familiar behavior made anyone feel ­uncomfortable.Cuomo has also suggested that he was simply being an old-school politician in greeting people with hugs and kisses — and that ""sensitivities"" have changed.An investigation into the sexual-harassment allegations is currently being led by attorneys Joon Kim, a former prosecutor with the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, and Anne Clark, an employment-discrimination attorney. The duo was selected by state Attorney General Letitia James, a Cuomo ally, to lead the probe.How they metLee and Cuomo first met in 2005 while guests at a cocktail party at the Hamptons home of Domna Stanton, a French professor at the City University of New York, and were introduced by one of Lee’s best friends, political adviser Alexandra Stanton, as Nancy Pelosi looked on.Though they were immediately smitten, they were each finalizing their respective divorces: Cuomo to Kerry Kennedy, the mother of his three daughters, and Lee to Bruce Karatz, the former CEO of KB Home. Karatz was 22 years Lee’s senior and in 2010 he was convicted of lying about the backdating of stock options at the LA-based homebuilder firm.

The state is facing criticism for the reported 200+ Palestinians killed, as well as strikes such as the one on an evacuated media building – although the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that it was being used by Hamas, with media outlets being used as cover.Hamas has launched over 3,000 rockets into Israel since the conflict started nine days ago, and the state's Iron Dome has intercepted and dismantled more than 90%, according to the Israeli military. The Biden administration has been supportive of Israel so far, giving clear backing of Israel's right to defend itself and emphasizing that Hamas is a nationally recognized terrorist organization.Secretary of State Antony Blinken noted Thursday that there are ""fundamental differences between a terrorist organization, Hamas, that is indiscriminately raining down rockets -- in fact, targeting civilians -- and Israel's response defending itself, that is targeting the terrorists.""

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/israel-hamas-biden-netanyahu-fight-war-michael-goodwin,fox,Michael Goodwin: Israel vs. Hamas – Biden should let Netanyahu ...," close      Video US should be allowing Israel to ‘punish’ Hamas: Elliott Abrams The former deputy national security adviser joins ‘America’s Newsroom’ to discuss the major foreign policy test facing the Biden administration. For many Americans, the violent clash between Israel and Hamas sparks an understandable sense of having seen it all before. While it’s true there is a long, bloody history between the combatants, the current fighting is unique in ways that make the endgame especially crucial for the Jewish state and the entire region. The most obvious change is that Hamas increased its rocket capacity, both in numbers and range. In previous battles, the relative handful of explosives launched from Gaza were a threat only to Israelis near the border. This time, more than 2,000 rockets and mortars have been fired, and Israeli officials are surprised at how far some can travel. While the explosives are unguided and many are destroyed by Iron Dome batteries, the sheer number has at times overwhelmed the defense system, making all of Israel more vulnerable. VICTOR DAVIS HANSON: BIDEN FLIRTING WITH DISASTER – HERE'S WHERE DIVISION AT HOME, WEAKNESS ABROAD WILL LEADAir raid sirens are sending residents to defense shelters all over the country and some civilians have been killed, including a child. The rockets are smuggled from Iran or built in Gaza using Iranian supplies, making the weapons a proxy for Iran’s malign reach. Hezbollah, the Iranian cat’s-paw controlling Lebanon, sits on Israel’s northern border, and three rockets fired from there Friday caused concern that a second front might develop. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERThere also are outbreaks of violence in the West Bank and Arab villages in Israel, some involving Jewish and Muslim civilians ­attacking each other. Still, the main event is the Iranian connection and the willingness of Hamas to fire indiscriminately on civilian areas, including Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. That combination justifies Israel’s ferocious response and its effort to wipe out the terrorist group’s leadership. More from Opinion Dr. Nicole Saphier: COVID-19 and America – the state of emergency is over and it's time to declare itReps. Scalise, Stauber: Peace Officers Memorial Day – In National Police Week, remember and say thanksSen. Tom Cotton: Don't let Biden, Fauci, Dems skirt big questions on COVID's origins – it matters to us allA Wednesday tweet from the Israel Defense Forces showed the faces of 14 men it said were ­""neutralized."" ""They were responsible for the rocket attacks against Israel in the last 72 hours,"" the tweet read. ""They will never plan another terror attack again."" The decapitation strikes illustrate Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s plan to inflict massive and lasting damage on Hamas. To head off any push for quick restraint, which would give Hamas a public relations victory and spare its leaders, Israeli officials told the Biden adminis­tration to buzz off. They want the freedom to act because they believe it is crucial that Hamas not only lose the war it started, but for its defeat to be widely seen and understood. Otherwise, the terrorists will gain stature and an incentive to do it again. To achieve that success, Israel needs sufficient time to smash the organization’s operating ability and destroy its arms cache. How much time is a guess, but it is probably a matter of days, not weeks. Israel’s superiority drives the left crazy, with the anti-Semitic wing of the Democratic Party calling the response inhumane and even terrorism. Naturally, Israel’s superiority drives the left crazy, with the anti-Semitic wing of the Democratic Party calling the response inhumane and even terrorism. Rep. ­Ilhan Omar ridiculously claimed the war is unfair because Palestinians don’t have an Iron Dome. She should have reminded ­Hamas of that before it started the rocket barrage. Then again, the warning would have fallen on deaf ears because Hamas paints a target on its own civilians by hiding explosives in residential neighborhoods and putting rocket launchers near schools. If it spent half as much on schools, medicine and civilian infrastructure as it spends trying to kill Jews, Gaza would be far better off. The vast tunnel system Hamas built under Gaza City is a glaring example of how it diverts millions of dollars and construction material to war while using ordinary Palestinians as shields.  VideoIsrael goes the extra mile by often warning Arab civilians by telephone to evacuate buildings it is targeting, showing more concern for them than Hamas does. Does Israel make mistakes, and sometimes hit innocent civilians? Of course. But these are accidents, while Hamas targets Israeli civilians. Where’s the outrage over that? The latest media huffing and puffing involves a charge that the Israeli military spread a false claim that a Gaza invasion was underway, with the aim of luring ­Hamas fighters to tunnels, which Israel promptly bombed. If true, the deception wasn’t ­kosher, but the outrage carries a whiff of hypocrisy. It’s as if the media demands a monopoly on fake news from Israel. In fact, the war started as a propaganda bid by Hamas. Demonstrations over a Jerusalem property dispute led to violence near Al-Aqsa Mosque on Temple Mount, with Arabs throwing rocks and Israeli soldiers firing stun guns. The confrontation came days after the feckless Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas canceled elections in the West Bank because Hamas would have made gains and become part of the government. The rocket barrage is Hamas’ way of showing Palestinians it is their defender, and that Abbas can’t be trusted.  VideoOddly, Hamas is right on the trust issue. Now in the 16th year of a four-year term, Abbas foolishly rejected every overture from the Trump administration and ended up further isolated. His refusal to get to yes on any deal has impoverished his people and exasperated Arab and Muslim states. The decision by Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco and Sudan to recognize Israel and establish trade and tourism relations in part reflected their disgust with Abbas’ dithering. It’s also a given that Hamas and Iran are testing President Biden. David Friedman, who was Trump’s ambassador to Israel, argues Hamas aimed to inflict damage on Israel while being spared a full retaliation because it believed Biden would quickly pressure Israel to de-escalate. ""I’m sure to Hamas’ dismay the Biden administration has not – at least not yet – sought to handcuff Israel and has supported its right of self-defense,"" Friedman writes in the The Hill. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPMore critically, Friedman cites Biden’s ""seemingly irrational eagerness"" to rejoin the Iran nuclear deal. The new president wants to lift the Trump-era economic sanctions without demanding any restraint on either Iran’s nuclear program or aggressive support of Hamas. Count that as another reason why Israel deserves the time to deal Hamas a crushing blow. Anything less will embolden the terrorists and Iran to start yet another round of bloodletting.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM MICHAEL GOODWIN  Michael Goodwin is a Fox News contributor and New York Post columnist.",2021-03-08 02:33:00

Security Council to prevent the resolution that would be a major rebuke to the longstanding U.S. ally. Republicans and some Democrats in the United States are supportive of Israel, however, noting the difference in tactics between the two entities – they say Hamas is firing rockets indiscriminately at civilians and Israel is taking pains to save civilian lives even as Hamas uses civilians as human shields. ""They aren’t at war with the Palestinian people.

In addition, it will fund disaster assistance in Gaza to the tune of $5.5 million, and an additional $32 million to the controversial U.N.

Bernie Sanders on Sunday called Hamas a ""terrorist group"" but also said the Israeli government is ""right-wing"" and contains ""overt racists"" as he urged the Biden administration to dial back its support of Israel under the leadership of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Sanders, I-Vt., made the comments in an interview on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" in the aftermath of a cease-fire last week that ended 11 days of fighting between Hamas and Israel. The fighting resulted in more than 200 deaths as Hamas fired rockets indiscriminately into Israeli territory and Israel responded with punishing airstrikes against the terror group in Gaza. Pressed on how the U.S. can take an ""evenhanded"" approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict when the Hamas terrorist group does not recognize Israel's right to exist, Sanders slammed the Netanyahu government, saying it is not innocent in the hostilities. ""What you have got to do is also understand that over the years the Netanyahu government has become extremely right-wing. And that there are people in the Israeli government now who are overt racists,"" Sanders told the CBS program. ""You have in West Jerusalem people being evicted from their homes.

You have Hamas, a terrorist group. You have a right-wing Israeli government and the situation is getting worse. And all that I'm saying is that the United States of America has got to be leading the world in bringing people together, not simply supplying weapons to kill children in Gaza.""Sanders cited the 56% poverty rate in Gaza to bolster his argument that Israeli strikes on the area are wrong. He also said the latest round of fighting results in ""wastewater plants destroyed, clinics destroyed, hospitals destroyed.""The senator last week introduced a resolution to force a vote on whether to block the recent sale of $735 million in weapons from the U.S. to the Israel Ministry of Defense, including Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) and Small Diameter Bombs.

""But once again, our job is not simply to put more and more military support for Israel.

""They were brutally abusing Gaza civilians as a human shield for their war machine.""Sanders also in the CBS interview slammed rising anti-Semitism, saying Americans have to ""combat"" that bigotry. But Sanders quickly moved to a more general condemnation of an ""increase in hate crimes in this country against Asians, against African Americans,  against Latinos.""It's not clear how long the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could hold, with both sides claiming victory and saying they will only ""hold fire"" as long as the other side does. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIsraeli offensive and defensive capacity are still in solid shape.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.Good evening. Welcome to Washington. I'm Bret Baier.Breaking tonight, we're following two major foreign policy stories. President Biden is stepping up the pressure on Israel to make what is being called a significant de-escalation in its conflict with Hamas. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is rejecting that call.First up, the president's decision to waive sanctions on the company behind a controversial Russian pipeline project to Europe, specifically Germany. He's getting more criticism about that today even as the administration announces penalties for other Russian entities.Let's get details now from White House correspondent Peter Doocy, he's live on the North Lawn. Good evening, Peter.PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Good evening, Bret. The day before the inauguration, Antony Blinken went to the Senate and told lawmakers there he agreed with them that Nord Stream 2 pipeline was a bad idea but not for the environmental reasons that have led this administration to cancel pipelines here in the states already. Instead, because it would give Russia an advantage in the region.But tonight, the Biden administration is going to waive sanctions on certain officials that will make it possible for this project to be completed. And Antony Blinken is sitting with Russia's Foreign Minister right now in Iceland making nice.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: President Biden has demonstrated that in both word and deed, not for purposes of escalation, not to seek conflict but to defend our interests.DOOCY (voice over): This foreign policy decision tonight has the top foreign policy Democrat in the Senate furious.Bob Menendez writes, the administration has said that the pipeline is a bad idea and that it is a Russian malign influence project. I share that sentiment but fail to see how today's decision will advance U.S. efforts to counter Russian aggression in Europe.(END VIDEO CLIP)DOOCY (on camera): And as President Biden makes this big concession to Russia, who he is called an opponent before. He's also applying new pressure to Israel, a long-standing U.S. ally.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DOOCY (voice over): It's long been part of Biden's pitch on the campaign trail.JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Bibi Netanyahu, I know well.DOOCY: And at the White House.JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: He's obviously somebody that he has a long-standing relationship with.DOOCY: Today, a test as the White House tells us, the president conveyed to the Prime Minister that he expected a significant de-escalation today on the path to a ceasefire.SEN. TOM COTTON (R-AR): Who cares what Joe Biden expects? The people of Israel have a right an expectation that they can protect themselves from thousands of rockets and missiles being fired into their cities.DOOCY: The White House provided a short readout of the leaders call but hasn't detailed what's next.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What recourse does the U.S. have to take if Israel doesn't meet that deadline?KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY TO JEN PSAKI: Well, again, I'm going to let the readout play out for -- say -- speak for itself.DOOCY: After a chat with Democratic Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, a critic of Israel who recently accused the Israeli government of using an apartheid system against the Palestine. The president sympathized with her relatives in the West Bank.BIDEN: I pray that your grand mom and family are well.DOOCY: Did that get Tlaib to lay off Israel? No, because today she signed on to a resolution hoping to block Biden from sending arms to Israel saying the harsh truth is that these weapons are being sold by the United States to Israel with the clear understanding that the vast majority of them will be used to bomb Gaza.SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX): Accusing Israel of committing acts of terrorism as the squad has done, it is unconscionable.DOOCY: Hoping to keep weapons away from Israel's enemies, Republican Congressman Brian Mast re-introduced a resolution to sanction backers of the terror group Hamas.REP. BRIAN MAST (R-FL): Hamas does not finance terrorism with bake sales. They receive significant support from individual groups and foreign governments like Iran.DOOCY: Democrats defeated that resolution in a party line vote.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In the opinion of the chairs the ayes have it.DOOCY: The president's day started with the mess in the Middle East. But hours later, he tried to keep things light when Coast Guard Academy graduates didn't appreciate a scripted joke.BIDEN: You're a really dull class. I mean, come on man, is the sun getting to you?(END VIDEO CLIP)DOOCY (on camera): So, maybe President Biden is not much of a comedian today, but he is showing himself to be a deliberator. There are no serious calls for him to send U.S. troops to the Middle East to intervene in this new conflict. But there is pressure on him from progressives to stop helping Israel.We do not expect any major foreign policy announcements for the rest of tonight though, because as soon as the president got back from delivering that commencement address, the White House told us no more on-camera events today, Bret.BAIER: It's so-called lid. Peter Doocy live in the North Lawn. Peter, thanks.Now, to the latest on the Middle East fighting. Senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot live in Tel Aviv early Thursday morning. Hello, Greg.GREG PALKOT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Hello, Bret. Yes, there are new reports tonight that we could see a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in the next couple of days.But as it stands right now, despite new White House pressure, we could be in a dangerous status quo.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PALKOT (voice over): Amid ongoing clashes between Israel and Hamas, more signs a cessation in hostilities might be closer.President Biden in another call with Prime Minister Netanyahu saying he expects de-escalation today, more pressure to coming from the U.N., the E.U. and regional powers.Netanyahu, however, remained in a fighting mood talking about Hamas.BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER: There are only two ways that you can deal with them. You can either conquer them, and that's always an open possibility or you can deter them. And we are engaged right now in forceful deterrence.PALKOT: Hamas striking out again Southern in central Israel in the rocket fire. Israel even hit by rockets from Lebanon, no one was hurt. The Israelis remain active on the front lawn.We are at an airbase in central Israel watching an F-15 of the Israeli Air Force take off planes from here have been heading south to Gaza, some 30 miles with some heavy weapons doing some pretty bad damage to militants there and others.The damage to Hamas has been substantial. According to Israel, some 820 terror targets hit, 130 militants killed, but it's the havoc heaped on Palestinian civilians that has the world concerned. Some 230 killed including 64 children, over 1,600 wounded, shortages in food, medicine, power and water. 60,000 homeless and some still missing.REHAM OWDA, POLITICAL ANALYST: Now we are in urgent need to save the civilian and protect the civilian. We need international community to support the civilian regardless of the conflict between Israel and Hamas.PALKOT: Even this Israeli Air Force Captain who's been involved in multiple sorties over Gaza sounds like he'd be happy for a break to.CAPTAIN B, ISRAELI AIR FORCE PILOT: On a personal level, I 100 percent want peace and want zero civilian casualties on both sides.(END VIDEO CLIP)PALKOT (on camera): And by the way, we were asked withhold that Captain B's name for security reasons.Throughout the night, we've been watching new reports of both Hamas rocket fire and Israeli airstrikes. It could be as some analysts have said to us last licks before the end, before that dangerous end. Back to you, Bret.BAIER: I hopefully so. Greg Palkot in Tel Aviv. Greg, thanks.A presidential nominee for a key intelligence post. The top spot, he's under scrutiny tonight. A Republican senator raising concern over work the nominee did for a Chinese telecommunications company, Huawei. A company that was called a national security threat by the last administration.Correspondent Kevin Corke is here tonight with details. Good evening, Kevin.KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Good evening, Bret. Huawei as you know has been heavily sanctioned by the U.S. government after accusations that its infrastructure equipment actually enables the Chinese Communist Party to surveil users.And now, Republicans on Capitol Hill are asking a key Biden nominee searing questions about his past involvement with the company. His name is Christopher Fonzone. He's been nominated to become the general counsel of the ODNI, for the folks outside of Washington at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.On Tuesday, Nebraska Republican Senator Ben Sasse asked Fonzone about Huawei's link to China's oppression of its Uighur minority.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. BEN SASSE (R-NE): What do you think of the role that they've played in the Chinese Communist Party's genocide in Xinjiang?I'm trying to ask why would you make a decision to work for Huawei, given who they are.CHRISTOPHER FONZONE, ODNI, GENERAL COUNSEL NOMINEE: My firm asked if I would help address some questions on how does U.S. administrative law works. I did a very small amount of analysis on with respect to that question less than 10 hours.CORKE: Less than 10 hours. So, the nominee also said that he's aware that the ODNI has made an assessment that Huawei poses a significant counterintelligence risk. He also vowed that he would use the latest intelligence available in any legal analysis, but that answer didn't satisfy Sasse.SASSE: Who did you think they were? Because they're the bad guys as a company that's involved in genocide and this is a company that habitually systematically is involved in stealing I.P. from U.S. companies. Helping them with rulemaking or their understanding of rulemaking is not helping a morally neutral actor and it's not helping them comply with U.S. law. It's helping them figure out how they can skirt U.S. law.(END VIDEO CLIP)CORKE (on camera): No surprise right after the hearing, Sasse said that Fonzone should not be confirmed to the role.Now, over the weekend, the ODNI actually hailed Fonzone in a statement writing, his wealth and experience and expertise will make Chris an outstanding addition to the ODNI leadership team.As for Huawei, it has consistently denied accusations that it is controlled by the Communist Party or facilitates Chinese spying, Bret.BAIER: Kevin, thanks. This is for the top legal spot and the Director of National Intelligence. Kevin, thanks.It's increasing political pressure tonight on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to end her mandatory mask policy at the Capitol.Congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has specifics from Capitol Hill. Good evening, Chad.CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Good evening, Bret.BAIER: I heard today House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy tried to get the House to drop this mask policy.PERGRAM: That's right. There's a mask rebellion in the House here, Bret. McCarthy wrote a resolution saying the House mask policy on the floor is contrary to CDC guidance. He says it's ""Not based on the best available science."" Some GOP members say the House rule is arbitrary.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MAST: There's not really a real protocol to it. They're just telling us that if we're on the floor without a mask, they're going to find us even though the CDC says if you've been vaccinated, resume your normal life.PERGRAM (voice over): The House right now is voting to kill McCarthy's resolution. Capital attending physician Brian Monahan rejected McCarthy's argument.Monahan says the House's mask requirement is consistent with CDC policy. Monahan says the House floor is the only place where all members gather during the day and you have a combination of vaxxed and unvaxxed people.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERGRAM (on camera): The House fined four members yesterday $500 apiece for not wearing a mask on the floor, Bret.BAIER: Chad, the House also is about to approve a bill to create a commission to study the January 6th riot. You have the House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and the Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell both opposed.PERGRAM: That's right. That vote's going to come right after this vote on the McCarthy resolution.Yesterday, Mitch McConnell said he wanted to study the fine print of that bill. Today, McConnell called the plan slanted.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): It's not at all clear what new facts or additional investigation, yet another commission could actually lay on top of existing efforts by law enforcement and Congress. The facts have come out and they'll continue to come out.PERGRAM (voice over): Some Republicans who back the probe take issue with McConnell's reasoning.To DOJ/FBI side is a criminal investigation. The House has oversight responsibility, namely to security breaches. Security is very important, just like 9/11 where were the breakdowns in the system and the planning and the staffing and the preparation and figure out how we can fix that to make sure it never happens again.PERGRAM: If the commission is formed, it's possible it could subpoena McCarthy and even former President Trump.McCarthy says the Commission's mandate was too narrow and it should have included the 2017 baseball practice shooting along with the Good Friday attack which killed officer Billy Evans.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERGRAM (on camera): Senate Democratic whip Dick Durbin said he couldn't believe McConnell's opposition. Durbin says McConnell was enraged during the riot. Durbin says McConnell was determined the mob would not keep the Senate from doing its work on January 6th, Bret.BAIER: Chad, thank you.The latest analysis from George Washington University indicates 429 individuals have been charged in federal court over the January 6th riot. Washington Post reports 53 people are currently still detained.The charges generally fall into three categories, violent offenses, such as assaulting police, weapons violations, or conspiracy allegations.About a dozen are alleged members or associates of extremist groups such as the Proud Boys or Oath Keepers. About 15 are military veterans. One is a former police officer.So far, only one defendant has entered a guilty plea. And there are no reports of any cases that have been dismissed.Former President Trump is facing a one two punch of criminal investigations in New York tonight. The State Attorney General's office says it's ongoing civil inquiry into his business dealings is now a criminal matter.The Attorney General's office confirms it is conducting the probe in tandem with the Manhattan District Attorney's office, which has been scrutening -- scrutinizing rather, former President Trump and his company the Trump Organization for about two years.Stocks were off today for the third straight day.

National Security Correspondent Jennifer Griffin tells us how Iran is using American prisoners as leverage in its effort to get rid of crippling economic sanctions and to achieve a new nuclear deal with the U.S. Jennifer reports tonight from the Pentagon.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)JENNIFER GRIFFIN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice over): As the Biden administration continues talks with Iran about restarting the nuclear deal, five Americans are being held in prison by Tehran as human bargaining chips, among them Emad Shargi, a 56-year-old American businessmen.BAHAREH SHARGI, HUSBAND IMPRISONED IN IRAN: He was simply taken, you know, taken, yanked out of our life and without an explanation.GRIFFIN: He and his wife of 32 years inspired by travel shows and Anthony Bourdain, decided to visit Tehran three years ago to see the country they left as children, a decision that would upend their lives. 15 secret police stormed their apartment at 2:30 in the morning and took the Emad to Tehran's notorious Evin prison.SHARGI: I went there for two weeks every morning and it was as if they didn't know who I'm talking about until they finally told me your husband is here and will be here for a long time.GRIFFIN: Emad Shargi has not been charged or put on trial.SHARGI: Nobody has seen him for five and a half months.GRIFFIN: His two daughters Hannah and Ariana described how hard it has been not having their father home with them in the U.S. He has missed both their college graduations and so much more.HANNAH SHARGI, DAUGHTER OF EMAD SHARGI: Our dad is really just the most incredible father in the world. He's extremely present. He shows up for you all the time, every single game. He is the person that we all turn to. He's the one who keeps our family together. He's the foundation of our family.What we do know is that he's an innocent American who's being held against his well unable to come home.GRIFFIN: Six days after becoming Secretary of State, Antony Blinken spoke to the families of all Americans detained wrongfully overseas.ANTHONY BLINKEN, SECRETARY OF STATE: I'm determined to bring every American home. We have to take a stand against the arbitrary detention of citizens for political purposes.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And for the first time we truly understand what it means to be an American and that's to have your whole country, your whole community rally behind you and really be there for you. So, I think that's what's gotten us through the last three years.(END VIDEOTAPE)GRIFFIN (on camera): The State Department has played down reports of an imminent prisoner swap. The Special Envoy for Iran, Rob Malley, is currently in Vienna leading the nuclear talks. Bret?BAIER: Jennifer Griffin at the Pentagon, Jennifer, thank you.

It forces, in fact, judgment.JANE TIMKEN (R-OH) SENATORIAL CANDIDATE: Parents are up in arms and alarmed. They want to know what's happening in their schools.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: First, beyond our borders tonight, the family of a Jewish man who was lynched by an Arab mob last week has donated his organs. An Arab woman in Jerusalem received his kidney. She says she feels she now has a Jewish family and that there is a place for the man in heaven.French police officers hold a huge demonstration outside parliament to press for a law guaranteeing jail time for people who assault them and for harsher penalties against criminals.

We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: It appears Critical Race Theory is becoming the new hot button issue on the campaign trail. Chief Washington Correspondent Mike Emanuel tells us the controversial approach is already making big waves in the run up to coming elections.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)YOUNGKIN: The current state of our schools is at the top of the list of concerns.MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Some key Republicans are convinced running against critical race theory could be a winning issue. Virginia Republican nominee for Governor Glenn Youngkin says parents are alarmed.YOUNGKIN: It's viewed as absolutely being a political agenda, not an educational curriculum. And oh, by the way, when I'm governor, we are not going to have Critical Race Theory in our schools.EMANUEL: Youngkin is likely to face former Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe in November. McAuliffe is fired back on Twitter. ""Glenn, I launched my campaign on education. You should read my plan. Maybe it'll give you ideas if you ever decide to write one.""In Ohio, Republican Jane Timken is running for retiring Senator Rob Portman's seat next year.TIMKEN: When we're talking -- pushing students to learn through a lens of racism. It's the exact wrong way and it's against our American principles of equal opportunity for all.EMANUEL: Timken has started a listening tour on Critical Race Theory.TIMKEN: This is a very divisive propaganda that is being pushed on students at the expense of a good education.EMANUEL: Two Republican governors widely expected to run for president in 2024 Ron DeSantis and Kristi Noem have banned Critical Race Theory from classrooms in their states, suggesting this could be a key issue heading into 2024. Democratic strategist Leslie Marshall says the GOP could be going down the wrong path.LESLIE MARSHALL, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Republicans should be harping on immigration. That would be a smarter campaign slogan, if you will, than Critical Race Theory. I think because a lot of voters left and right either don't care about it, don't fully understand it.(END VIDEOTAPE)EMANUEL (on camera): The first test will be here in Virginia. If this issue works in the governor's race in November, it will likely be part of the GOP campaign playbook in the midterm elections next year. Bret?BAIER: Mike, thank you. Speaking of Virginia, Virginia Republican Gubernatorial Nominee Glenn Younkin will be our guest tomorrow night on SPECIAL REPORT.President Biden's commissioned to study upon expansion of the U.S. Supreme Court had its first meeting today. It's an idea then Senator Joe Biden once fiercely ridiculed. But things have changed. Here is correspondent David Spunt.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: An institution formed in 1790 is under a top to bottom review 231 years later. Today a 36 member bipartisan panel met for the first time to discuss monumental changes to the Supreme Court. The commission, established by President Biden, will look at the possibility of adding justices to the court, taking some away, and eliminating life tenure.BOB BAUER, SUPREME COURT COMMISSION CO-CHAIR: We really do not believe we can do this work without the benefit of the broadest diversity of perspectives.SPUNT: Membership ranges from liberal Harvard professor Laurence Tribe to former federal judge Thomas Griffith, a George W. Bush appointee. The Constitution does not establish a set number of justices. That's up to Congress. There were initially six members of the high court, then five, then seven, then nine, down to eight, 10 for a while, back down to eight, before finally setting on nine a century-and-a-half ago.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I will appoint justices who will not overtake to override the judgment of the congress.SPUNT: In 1937, President Franklin D. Roosevelt wanted 15 justices on the court, a plan called court packing. His plan failed. In 1983, a senator from Delaware named Joe Biden called the idea, well --JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It was a bonehead idea.SPUNT: But some Democrats in 2021 believe the idea is perfect.SEN. ED MARKEY, (D-MA): The United States Supreme Court is broken. It is out of balance.SPUNT: Progressive Democrats want to add as many as four justices to the court. The commission will put out a final report by November, but no formal recommendations. Any changes would be up to Congress.PAUL SMITH, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY LAW CENTER: If the Democrats had done much, much better in the election than they did, I think there might be some momentum. But at this point, with a 50-50 Senate, it's just not happening.(END VIDEO TAPE)SPUNT (on camera): In addition to potential hurdles passing the Senate, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Bret, said that she has no plans to bring any legislation that would alter the number of justices on the court to the House floor. Bret?BAIER: David Spunt outside the Supreme Court. David, thank you.Up next, President Biden is pushing Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to draw down, but giving Russian leader Vladimir Putin a win. Our panel trying to make sense of the foreign policy after the break.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, (R-KY) SENATE MINORITY LEADER: Rather than having Israel's back, senior Democrats have actually pressured Israel to end its defensive operations. They have called for a ceasefire and urged leaders to strive for peace through a negotiated two-state solution.REP. RO KHANNA, (D-CA) HOUSE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE: Netanyahu is out there saying that he has a blank check from the United States. That's what he is saying. He said this is going to go on for more time and that the United States is with him. No, we are not. There are many members of Congress, including supporters of the U.S.-Israel relationship like myself and others, who are saying that Netanyahu does not have a blank check.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Well, the White House dealing very vocal members of their Democratic caucus up on the Hill about the issue of Israel, it actions against Hamas. The White House putting out a readout the call with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. ""President Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu today. The two had a detailed discussion on the state of events in Gaza, Israel's progress in degrading the capabilities of Hamas, and other terrorist elements, and ongoing diplomatic efforts by regional governments and the United States. The President conveyed to the Prime Minister that he expected a significant de-escalation today on the path to a ceasefire."" No indication yet that that has happened. We'll see if it does.Let's bring in our panel, Bill Bennett, former Education Secretary, host of ""The Bill Bennett Show"" podcast, Susan Page, Washington Bureau Chief at ""USA Today"" and the author of the book ""Madam Speaker, Nancy Pelosi and the Lessons of Power,"" and Ben Domenech, publisher of ""The Federalist."" Susan, speaking about Speaker Pelosi, she is having to kind of let her caucus speak its mind on this foreign policy issue. But the Biden administration seems to be trying to tiptoe through all of that.SUSAN PAGE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, ""USA TODAY"": I think President Biden had hoped to be as little engaged in this as possible. He certainly hasn't been as outspoken as some even in his own party had hoped he would be. Got a little farther forward today in his conversation with Netanyahu.But of course, Democrats are divided on the issue of the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, and there are significant number on the progressive side who thinks the United States should do much more to protect Palestinians even at the cost of pressuring our long-time ally, Israel. It is a difficult situation for the president, and it's one that I think Pelosi is well aware of because she has all these different voices in other own caucus.BAIER: Ben, Republicans obviously are jumping on this, saying that there is a Hamas caucus within the Democratic Party.BEN DOMENECH, PUBLISHER, ""THE FEDERALIST"": It is not a difficult situation for the president. The president ought to stand with Israel as America's longtime ally in the Middle East. But unfortunately, I think we see a situation here that the Iranians are looking to exploit. They have been on their heels thanks to the last four years of the Trump administration, which saw them really hurt in a lot of different ways, both seeing the top of their military exercise essentially knocked off, thanks to both the Israelis and the Americans, but, also, I think they see a situation where they are trying to seize this moment to lean in to this new administration, which has a lot of distrust with Israel and with Bibi Netanyahu and in trying to essentially attain a new dynamic that would allow them to restore what they were trying to do back in 2015.Unfortunately, I think we are seeing a situation where the incompetence of the Biden administration, their inconsistency when it comes to foreign policy, is leading to benefits for our enemies overseas.BAIER: Bill, there are some experts, foreign policy experts, not just Republicans, who say that this all points to Iran and its ability to funnel funds to Hamas and to produce this moment.BILL BENNETT, FORMER EDUCATION SECRETARY: Well, certainly the funds that went to Iran were used to make these rockets, which are being launched into Israel. And I think Bibi Netanyahu will stand his ground, as I know him, he will. But, further, we are now talking about giving Iran more money, remember, going back to the table, which means potentially fueling more of this, giving them more funds to produce more rockets.I will split the difference between Susan and Ben. I agree with Ben it's not difficult in terms of right and wrong here. Who started this fight and why did they start it, because they think there should be an end to the state of Israel. But it's a difficult situation for Biden because he doesn't know what he thinks. And he is being pressured by the left caucus and, of course he also wants to keep good relations with our greatest ally in the world. Bibi Netanyahu knows who he is, knows who he is, knows what he wants to do. Biden is in the process of figuring it out. Welcome to the job, Mr. President.BAIER: Meantime, this Nord Stream 2 pipeline under construction, Russia desperately wants it to be completed to go into Germany. There is a lot of thought about it as you look at the graphic of where it goes. It's not finished yet. There were stiff sanctions that are being lifted on the company that's constructing it. And there is some more reaction to all of that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JENNIFER GRANHOLM, ENERGY SECRETARY: I understand the state department soon is going to be releasing a report regarding the mandatory sanctions that Congress has imposed in assisting on the building of Nord Stream 2, and I understand that the State Department is going to notify Congress soon.MICHAEL BURGESS, (R-TX) HOUSE ENERGY AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE: I would love to see the argument how this waiver, which benefits, seemingly to me, benefits only Vladimir Putin, and we've already disadvantaged the citizens of the United States by not completing the last 100 yards of the Keystone pipeline. So I don't quite follow how that waiver in the national interest occurs.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Susan, what about this and how it plays?PAGE: Bill Bennett said welcome to the job, Mr. President. It is true that the job is a tough one, involves balancing interest. This is another example of that. This is not intended as a decision to help Russia. That's a side effect. This is intended as a decision to help Germany, which wanted very much the completion of the pipeline. It puts the administration in this awkward situation which we have heard about. Tony Blinken when he was in his confirmation hearings as secretary of state says the United States, the Biden administration would actively oppose completion of this pipeline. But I think when the balance of interest came out, they came out in a different position on that. And so Russia reaps the benefits of the desire of Germany to get this pipeline completed.BAIER: That is what the administration is saying, but it is interesting just in the context of the German elections are coming. Angela Merkel's term as chancellor is going to be over come September. And the leading party, Ben, is the Green Party, which actually is opposed to Nord Stream 2 in Germany. So you are going to have all kinds of things happening potentially in coming months.DOMENECH: There's a lot of moving parts here. And I think that one of the things that we really have to appreciate about this decision is that it really undermines NATO in a lot of different ways. It does not serve our interest in terms of benefiting Russia's ability to influence Europe. And I think that one of the things that obviously President Biden ran on as a candidate was his criticism of the Trump administration as being too soft on Russia in a lot of different respects. You can debate whether that was true, but from my perspective, what we have seen in the early days from this administration is not something that indicates a hard line toward Russia.I will be very curious to see if in their conversation Vladimir Putin and Joe Biden in the coming weeks, if they have any kind of conversation that includes the name Navalny. That is something that I think may not happen, and if that does not happen, it's an indication that this is an administration that is not willing to really stand up and hold the Russian's feet to the fire.BAIER: The opposition leader in Russia against Putin.Very quickly, Bill, this story against Ben Sasse, Senator Sasse, having a problem in grilling this nominee for general counsel for the Department of National Intelligence because he did work for Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications company that has been under fire and under sanction by the U.S. If through the prism of this happened in the Trump administration, how would it look tonight?BENNETT: Well, everything would look different, and to the media everything would be different. Ben Sasse can be very wrong in my view, can be out on a limb sometimes. But today or yesterday he was right. This very experienced Washington hand, this lawyer, acting as if he was just helping with administrative rules, when these administrative rules are things they can get around so Huawei can continue its efforts. And, remember, this is a regime that persecute the Uyghurs, and we know about Huawei's role in that. It's really disgusting what's going on there.BAIER: All right, panel, stand by.Up next, commissions, one on the Supreme Court expansion, the other on looking into January 6th and the Capitol riot.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: Moments ago on the House floor, the vote was finished and there was a majority of the House that voted to establish the independent commission to look into January 6th, the riot that happened. There was opposition on the GOP side to that.We're back with the panel. Ben, there are people saying why oppose it, it's going to go forward? Why not look at it? What about that?DOMENECH: Well, I think that the Democrats in the House are designed to try to -- or focused basically on trying to exploit what happened on January 6th to continue to maintain the idea that there is some kind of radical element within American society that is bent on overthrowing the government. And that's something that, frankly, I think reasonable people will understand is not something that has happened.John Katko, who is the representative on the Republican side who had tried to negotiate something here, kind of got over his skis on this a little bit. He didn't really actually interface as much with Republican leadership as he probably ought to in order to try to attain something that would be reasonable in this vein.But look, there is no real reason to support this. We all know what happened. We all know what the straightforward result of it was. And I think that frankly this is a situation where Democrats are trying to exploit what happened for political gain and to continue to maintain a situation that leads to a militarized Capitol Hill, and the idea that there are creeping white supremacists organizations designed on overthrowing our government, which is simply not the case.BAIER: Susan, Democrats say we need to know what happened specifically, and that the former president doesn't know or acknowledge what happened specifically, so that it doesn't happen again.PAGE: I don't know what happened. There are lots of questions that I think have not been answered about what led up to the insurrection and about what exactly was prevented from having happened because of the brave work of Capitol police officers. I think there are a lot of questions that are still unanswered.The interesting thing about the vote you just showed, 35 Republicans defected even though their leader said vote against this, 35 Republicans supported it. In this day and age, that is a real display of bipartisanship. Now, it's going to have a tough road in the Senate. But that means that for at least those 35 Republicans they also have some questions they think this is an issue that is worth some future scrutiny.BAIER: That commission is going forward. We will follow all elements of that. Meantime the Supreme Court commission, take a listen to this on court-packing.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I would not get into court packing. We had three justices. Next time around we lose control, they had three justices. We began to lose any credibility the court has at all.CRISTINA RODRIGUEZ, SUPREME COURT COMMISSION CO-CHAIR: President Biden established this commission as you all know, and he charged us with producing a report within 180 days of this meeting that provides an account, in the words of the order, of the contemporary commentary and debate about the role of the Supreme Court in our system of government. We will actually assess the calls for reform themselves to assess the arguments for why reform is pressing as well as why it might not be.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Bill, there's a lot of people that look at this and say, hey, there is no chance. This is not going forward. But other people look at it and say it's the camel's nose under the tent, that some reform leads to something that's changes the judiciary as we know it.BENNETT: Well, it's also to take on another American institution. Anyone detect a pattern here? The president first day says no XL pipeline. Doesn't like American oil, but seems to like Russian oil. Doesn't like America's strongest ally so much, but is willing to support Iran, one of America's greatest enemies. And now let's attack a key American institution, just like the Electoral College and so on.Yes, this is going to lead to a lot of mischief, and this is the Democrats' plan. It's beginning to seem that there are a lot of themes that the Democrats are developing that kind of strike at the heart of what traditional America means and believes in. And let's see how much further this develops. I can't make any sense out of a lot of these policies.BAIER: Well, 2022, we'll figure some things out. We'll see.When we come back, tomorrow's headlines tonight with the panel.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: Finally tonight, a look at tomorrow's headlines with the panel. Bill, first to you.BENNETT: OK, I'll compress my English headline into Latin ""odi profanum vulgus,"" I hate the vulgar crowd. There is something about this Biden crowd which really hates a lot of American things. Americans like cars and oil. We hate them. If America loves Israel, we're going to put the brakes on that. Supreme Court, America likes the way it is? We are going to change it. How about traditional American history? Let's trash that, too. What is this contempt for the most ways Americans think and believe?BAIER: All right, the Latin headline tonight. Susan?PAGE: I'm sticking to English. Back to Benghazi. If the Senate does not approve this January 6th commission, as we think it probably won't, Nancy Pelosi has indicated that she will appoint a select committee like the Benghazi committee to look into the events of that day.BAIER: Wow. Here we go. Ben?DOMENECH: I can't compete with Bill. This is incredible.(LAUGHTER)DOMENECH: Media tries to make Kamala Harris happen and it is still not happening. She is down double digits according to the latest polls in terms of her approval from voters and in terms of her approval from independents. She is not someone who is popular with the American people.BAIER: All right, panel, thank you. Nice job.Tomorrow on SPECIAL REPORT interview with Virginia Republican gubernatorial nominee Glenn Youngkin.Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight.

https://www.foxnews.com/transcript/senior-adviser-to-israeli-prime-minister-optimistic-that-cease-fire-will-hold,fox,Senior adviser to Israeli prime minister optimistic that cease-fire will ...," close      Video Senior adviser to Israeli PM optimistic that cease-fire will hold Senior adviser to Israel's prime minister Mark Regev provides insight into the conflict between Israel and Gaza, and details the aftermathThis is a rush transcript from ""Fox News Sunday,"" May 23, 2021. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  I'm Chris Wallace. A ceasefire in the Middle East, but how long will it hold? (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)JOSEPH R. BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNTIED STATES:  I believe we have a genuine opportunity to make progress and I'm committed to working for it. WALLACE (voice-over): President Biden walking a tight rope in his first foreign policy crisis, praising the truce to end 11 days of conflict. BIDEN:  The Palestinians and Israelis equally deserve to live safely and securely. WALLACE:  But where does the situation in the Middle East stand now? And what about the glowing split among Democrats over Israel?We'll sit down with Mark Regev, senior advisor to Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, only on ""FOX News Sunday"". Then, the House approves an independent commission to investigate the January 6th attack on the Capitol, but opposition from Senate Republicans grows. SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), MINORITY LEADER:  I've made the decision to oppose the House Democrats' slanted and unbalanced proposal. WALLACE:  And Democrats slam Republicans for continuing to stand with the former president. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), MAJORITY LEADER:  They're caving to Donald Trump and proving that the Republican Party is still drunk off the big lie. WALLACE:  We'll talk with Senator Roy Blunt, a member of the GOP leadership, who says Democrats are playing politics with the commission and get reaction from Congressman Adam Kinzinger, one of 35 Republicans who voted for the investigation. Plus, we'll ask or send panel about the divides on Capitol Hill inside both parties. And our Power Player of the Week, the owner of Ben's Chili Bowl, a landmark in the nation's capital for six decades, on how they survived the pandemic. All, right now, on ""FOX News Sunday"". (END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE (on camera): And hello again from FOX News in Washington. That fragile cease-fire is still holding in the Middle East after 11 days of fighting between the Israelis and Palestinians left almost 300 dead. President Biden is walking a fine line, promising to rearm Israel while working to provide humanitarian aid to Gaza. And he's also dealing with a sharp split among Democrats about support for Israel. In a moment, we'll speak with Mark Regev, senior advisor to Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu. But, first, let's turn to Mark Meredith at the White House with the latest on the conflict and the politics here at home -- Mark. MARK MEREDITH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Chris, President Biden has spent a lot of time on the phone lately, urging Palestinian and Israeli officials to stop fighting and as you mention, while the cease-fire is holding today, the president is facing a long list of questions about how he hopes to achieve lasting peace in the Middle East. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BIDEN:  I'm praying this ceasefire will hold. I take Bibi Netanyahu when he gives me his word, I take him at his word. MEREDITH (voice-over): The U.S. says it firmly supports Israel's right to defend itself from terrorist groups like Hamas but some progressives say it's the Israelis who need to be reined in. SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT):  We should be bringing people together, not just being one-sided and saying everything that Israel does is good, because it is not. MEREDITH:  In the wake of civilian deaths in Gaza, some Democrats want the White House to cancel a massive arms deal to Israel. Republicans say it's proof Democrats are divided. MCCONNELL:  I think at least half the Democrats are hostile to Israel and the rest of them are afraid to those who are hostile to Israel. MEREDITH:  Violence abroad has many fearful of increased anti-Semitic attacks at home. Cellphone cameras capturing multiple violent incidents with Los Angeles Police investigating a fight at a restaurant as a possible hate crime. (END VIDEOTAPE)MEREDITH (on camera): Secretary of State Antony Blinken is set to visit the Middle East in coming days. He's expected to meet Israeli, Palestinian and regional leaders, all of whom who may be crucial to keeping this ceasefire in place -- Chris. WALLACE:  Mark Meredith reporting from the White House -- Mark, thank you. And joining us now from Jerusalem, Mark Regev, senior advisor to Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu. Ambassador, how confident are you that this ceasefire will last? Back in 2014, the last major outbreak of violence, it took nine truces over 56 days before Israel and Hamas finally stopped fighting. What are the chances we're going to see that again? MARK REGEV, SENIOR ADVISER TO ISRAELI PM BENJAMIN NETANYAHU:  Well, as you've just said, after that round of fighting in 2014, we did receive over half a decade of relative peace and quiet. And so, that is possible and I hope we can do that again. Ultimately, in the operation, we gave Hamas a heavy blow. We dismantled a large part of their terrorist military machine. We took out part of their leadership. We hit their command and control. Hopefully, they will think twice, even three times before they strike in Israel again. WALLACE:  There is no question that Hamas started the military conflict, firing 4,300 rockets into Israel and killing at least a dozen Israelis. But I think you would agree that the toll was much heavier on the Hamas side, in Gaza. Now, I want to put up some numbers on that. At least 248 Palestinians killed, including 66 children and 39 women; 800,000 people in Gaza do not currently have access to piped water. Ambassador, any second thoughts about whether the Israeli response during these 11 days was proportionate? REGEV:  They were firing thousands of rockets, as you just said, on our civilian population. They were trying to murder our people in their homes. We were defending ourselves. Our operation was fundamentally designed simply to protect our civilian population. Now, in the process of fighting back, we were trying to be a surgical as is humanly possible, in a very complex, combat situation. They were firing out of schools. They were firing out of built up areas. They were firing out of homes, out of mosques, even out of playgrounds. And we tried to be, as I said, to hit the terrorists and not to see innocent people caught up in the crossfire.And while our goal was to avoid civilian casualties, Hamas had actually the exact opposite goal. They were aiming their rockets at our people, trying to kill them, and, of course, they were brutally abusing Gaza civilians as a human shield for their war machine. We know for a fact that many of the casualties in this operation were caused by Hamas munitions. Almost 20 percent of their rockets fell short, landing in Gaza, killing Gaza civilians. It didn't bother them at all, they kept doing that. Part of the death and destruction was because of their ordnance, their explosives going off. We made a maximum effort to minimize human casualties, they did exactly the opposite. WALLACE:  One difference is that this time, Israel came under some heavy fire from the left wing of the Democratic Party. And I want to play some of the clips of that kind of rhetoric this past week. Take a look, sir. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. RASHIDA TLAIB (D-MI):  Palestinians aren't going anywhere no matter how much money you send to Israel's apartheid government.REP. ILHAM OMAR (D-MN): Every rocket and bomb that target civilians is a war crime. SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT):  Benjamin Netanyahu has cultivated an increasingly intolerant and authoritarian type of racist nationalism. (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Ambassador, do you worry that Israel is losing support among some major political elements here in the United States? And to what degree that you're losing that support does that bolster Hamas and hurt Israel? REGEV:  Well, I can tell you this morning before coming to this interview, I looked at the polling. And I saw that the overwhelming majority of the American people stand with Israel, support Israel, are favorable towards Israel. A majority of people who identify as Democrats also support Israel or favor Israel. And even I saw group -- people who self identify as liberal Democrats are favorable towards Israel. Of course, they want to see peace, but Israel wants to see peace too. We'd love to have peace with our Palestinian neighbors. And people need to understand -- Hamas is not just Israel's enemy. Hamas is the enemy of everyone who wants to seek peace and reconciliation in our part of the world. There were brutal jihadist terrorist group. No one should make excuses for them. WALLACE:  So how do you understand, how do you regard the criticism you're getting from Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and in addition from much more mainstream Democrats -- for instance, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Robert Menendez? REGEV:  So, Senator Menendez is a champion of the Israel-U.S. partnership, a champion of the alliance between our two democracies, a real friend of Israel. I think we weren't quick enough. He was particularly concerned about an attack on a particular structure and we weren't quick enough in our -- the facts of that matter out because it was played that somehow Israel attacked innocent civilians. It wasn't the case. In that building that the senator was concerned about, Hamas had its elite scientific research unit that was working on ways to try to counteract the guiding systems on our rockets. If they would have succeeded, not only couldn't we have shut down incoming rockets coming into Israel to kill our people, but we wouldn't have been able to be surgical in our strikes against Hamas' military machine, so that definitely was a legitimate military target. That Hamas was using journalists as a human shield shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone but we notify the journalists in advance and I'm happy to tell you that there was not a single civilian casualty from that operation. In fact, from my point of view, it was an Israeli tactical success because we took out a legitimate Hamas target, a dangerous Hamas target and at the same time, not a single innocent civilian was killed. That's a good thing. WALLACE:  One concern -- you talked about Israel wants peace. One concern is whether Israel is doing enough to address the root causes of the conflict. Here is a comment on Friday from President Biden. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOSEPH R. BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We still need a two-state solution. It is the only answer. (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Does Prime Minister Netanyahu still believe that a two-state solution is the only answer? And if so, what is he doing to achieve that? REGEV:  I know my prime minister believes in peace very, very strongly. In the last year, he -- we've made it through peace agreements with four Arab countries and we want to see more. He wants to expand the circle of peace to include the Palestinians as well.But let me be clear here, Hamas is not interested in peace. Hamas says that every Israeli man, woman, and child is a legitimate target in their terror war. Hamas says Israel, my country, should be destroyed, wiped off the map. Hamas says any Arab or Palestinian leader who makes peace with Israel should be murdered. I think in overcoming Hamas and defeating Hamas now, maybe we've created some room for more Palestinian moderate voices to move center stage because as long as Hamas is powerful, they can almost put a veto. WALLACE:  Yes, but, you know, there are a number of independent groups that say it's not all Hamas. The human rights group Human Rights Watch came out with a report last month that made a serious charge against Israel for the first time. I want to put it up on the screen. They said the oppression of Palestinians there in Israel has reached a threshold and a permanence that meets the definitions of the crimes of apartheid and persecution. Ambassador, it says that Israel has set up a system that oppresses Palestinians, especially in Gaza and the West Bank. REGEV:  I'd like to say when that report was issued, we read it carefully and we rejected it. It's simply not true.Israel is a democracy. It's a country with a free pass, a free parliament, a country where we hold our freedoms very, very seriously. We are in conflict with neighbors, especially in Gaza, run by brutal terrorist organizations. There's no parity here. You have a democratic country trying to protect its people and a brutal terrorist organization trying to kill civilians. We have to act to protect our people. WALLACE:  Finally, and I have about a minute left, Ambassador. With the -- in the -- there was an anti-Netanyahu coalition that was reportedly within days, perhaps within hours, of forming a government and ousting Prime Minister Netanyahu. Now that we've had these 11 days of conflict, is that dead? And is Israel headed for a fifth election in two years? REGEV:  You know, Chris, this might be the land of the Bible, but I'm no prophet and I can't foretell the future. I don't know what will happen here politically. I do know this: Israelis across the political spectrum were united in the need to defend our people against these Hamas rockets coming in and the need to take action and to stop it, and I think also Israelis were united wall to wall in our appreciation for the president, for President Biden, when he again and again reaffirmed Israel's right to defend ourselves against these incoming rockets. It was much appreciated. WALLACE: Ambassador Regev, thank you. Thanks for your time. We'll be following developments in the region over next days and weeks. Up next, we'll ask our Sunday panel about the new controversy over U.S. support for our oldest ally in the Middle East. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN:  I think that, you know, my party still supports Israel. REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY):  Do Palestinians have a right to survive? Do we believe that? (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez contradicting President Biden's claim there is no split inside the Democratic Party over Israel. And it's time now for our Sunday group, Guy Benson of FOX News Radio; Julie Pace, Washington bureau chief for ""The Associated Press""; and Charles Lane from ""The Washington Post."" Julie, how much do you think the growing criticism from some Democrats and as I mentioned in the last interview, especially from the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Robert Menendez -- how much do you think that criticism rattled the Biden White House and pushed them to go harder and sooner for a ceasefire from Israel? JULIE PACE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS:  I think the White House was certainly aware that the Democratic Party is split over this issue, that there is a much more vocal element of the Democratic Party that is supporting the Palestinian cause, that is not as reflexively pro-Israel as we have seen in the past. I do think Biden, though, was trying to walk this very careful line. You saw this over and over again in statements that he was making in readouts of the conversations that he was having with Prime Minister Netanyahu, with the conversations that Tony Blinken, Lloyd Austin, and others were having. The thing they put forward there at the forefront was, we support Israel's right to defend itself. They felt like it was critical to have that statement out there. But you did see then over the course of this conflict a move, privately at first, and then publicly to urge Israel to stop. I don't think that was driven fairly by politics but certainly the politics was something the White House was well aware of here. WALLACE:  Guy, I think it's fair to say that President Biden stood pretty firmly behind Israel throughout this conflict, but you know, whether it was the squad, whether it was Senator Menendez, whether it was senator Bernie Sanders, you have talk of apartheid, of racism, and war crimes. What do you make of that? GUY BENSON, ""THE GUY BENSON SHOW"":  Yeah, Chris, I listen to your interview in the last segment very carefully and I hope that the ambassador is right about America remaining steadfastly pro-Israel across-the-board and he said he looked at some polling. There's a new poll out in the last few days of YouGov that shows when they asked Democrats which side of this conflict they sympathize more with, more Democrats say Palestinians than Israelis. I think it that is an extraordinary sea change that we're seeing in the Democratic Party. I think some of the old guard remains pro-Israel but the younger, very vocal sort of up-and-coming element of the progressive left, they have cast in their lot with the Palestinians and I think in some cases amplify what amount to Hamas talking points. I think it's frightening to see. I think Republicans are much more united on this front, independents remain heavily pro-Israel. But there is a real fight here in the Democratic Party over this issue. WALLACE:  Chuck, let me pick up on that. Do you think the real story, the big story here is that the continuing support for Israel among most American politicians, Republicans and Democrats, or this growing criticism of Israel from the left wing of the Democratic Party? CHUCK LANE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I would put it this way: when commentators in the Palestinian community claimed victory in this contest that has perhaps just concluded, the main point they cited was the growth of support for the Palestinian cause in global opinion, particularly the United States. I don't think they are wrong to see it that way. They paid a heavy price militarily, but in public opinion around the world on the progressive left, the Palestinian cause is now seeing, ironically, almost as sympathetically as the Jewish and Israeli cause was seen 60 years ago. I think it's been a long time coming. There are a lot of reasons for that. Certainly in the United States, one reason is that Prime Minister Netanyahu made a very overt pro-Donald Trump, pro-Republican kind of lunge over the last four years and that alienated a lot of Democrats. He became more partisan. And I think now we are going to see in our country, Israel, the Middle East, become a much more partisan issue with Democrats on one side of it relatively speaking and Republicans on the other. WALLACE:  Let's turn to the facts on the ground. Here was Prime Minister Netanyahu this week. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER:  You can either conquer them, and that's always an open possibility, or you can deter them. And we are engaged right now in forceful deterrence but I have to say we don't rule out anything. (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Julie, under President Trump, I think it's fair to say that the push for the two-state solution, the traditional diplomatic position of the United States was put on the shelf and you saw a much greater effort to achieve these Abraham Accords between Israel and other Arab countries like Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. But didn't these last 11 days show that you just can't ignore the central conflict between Israel and the Palestinians? PACE:  Or that if you do ignore it, that it's not going to get any better on its own and it will continue to flare up and continue to push its way to the forefront here. And I think what's interesting is that when Joe Biden came into office, he didn't put the Middle East, he certainly didn't put the Israeli-Palestinian issue at the forefront of his foreign policy. He wanted to focus on rebuilding global alliances, he wanted to focus on Asia more, trying to counter China. And I think with these last 11 days have shown is that a U.S. administration, whether it wants to or not has to deal with this situation. I think what we're going to be watching for in the coming weeks and months is what the Biden position is going to be here. How actively involved is his administration going to get in trying to potentially restart peace talks here that the region has changed, you do have these peace accords now between Israel and some Arab countries. That is an important dynamic that has shifted here, but the Biden demonstration has a choice now to make about what their own approaches going to be and how active and central this will be to the president's foreign policy. WALLACE:  And, of course, adding to all the difficulties, you've got this huge split inside Israel, the Netanyahu forces and the anti-Netanyahu forces as we may be headed to the fifth election in two years and a huge and growing split among the Palestinians between the more establishment Fatah wing and Hamas. So if you are further away from the peace deal and ever. Panel, we have to take a break here. We'll see later in the hour. Up next, a bipartisan commission to investigate the events of the January 6th attack on Capitol Hill faces an uphill battle in the Senate. We'll talk to two key Republicans on opposing sides of the issue when we come right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  Coming up, the fate of the January 6th commission is now in the hands of a divided Senate. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MCCONNELL:  I made the decision to oppose the House Democrats' slanted and unbalanced proposal. SCHUMER:  Shame on the Republicans for choosing the big lie over the truth. (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  We'll ask our Sunday panel whether Congress will approve it. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  Majority Leader Chuck Schumer plans to bring a bill to the Senate floor soon creating a commission to investigate the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol. But Republicans appear to have the votes to kill the measure. There is a sharp split inside the GOP about the need for an independent commission. In a moment, we'll speak with a member of the Senate leadership, Roy Blunt, who says the panel will only slow down reforms that are already underway, but first, from Illinois, Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger. Congressman, after the House approved the commission with 35 Republicans in the House breaking with the GOP leadership to support the panel, it appeared that there was a possibility Congress was going to approve this commission. But then, the Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell spoke out this week. Take a look at what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), MINORITY LEADER:  It's not at all clear what new facts or additional investigation yet another commission could actually lay on top of existing efforts by law enforcement and Congress. (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Congressman, with several congressional committees in both the House and Senate investigating the events of January 6th, are there questions? And if so, what are they, the biggest questions that you think a commission would be able to answer but that these committees will not be able to answer? REP. ADAM KINZINGER (R-IL):  Yeah, certainly. So let's keep in mind the investigations that are ongoing things like into specific criminal actions. That's why you've seen 400 people arrested. That's what the FBI can do. There can be discussions about, you know, did the House security fail? But what we need is a comprehensive look at what happened that led up to January 6th, who was talking to who? What were the lies? And here's the truth, Chris, the American people -- and it's Sunday and you learned in Sunday school, truth matters. The American people deserve the truth.And my party to this point have said things like it was hugs and kisses, it was Antifa and BLM, it was anything but what it was, which was a Trump-inspired insurrection on the Capitol. And people deserve to hear the truth. And I think now what's going to happen if this thing fails is that Nancy Pelosi will run a select committee and this could go all the way to 2024.CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  Why do you think that Senate Republicans, led by Mitch McConnell, are apparently going to be able to block this commission? Do you think it's all about politics on their part?And don't they have a point that one of the reasons the Democrats are pushing so hard for this commission is because they want to bring the controversy over what happened on January 6th and over the alleged role that Donald Trump played in it, they want to bring that into the 2022 midterms?KINZINGER:  Well, you know, here's a revelation, this is going to the 2022 midterms anyway, particularly if us as Republicans don't take ownership for what happened, if every other day, there's a new conspiracy theory about what happened at the Capitol, anybody but what it was. And so, yeah, that I think it will go to 2022. And we'll look like we are just sitting here denying reality and facts.I get it, it may have a political impact, but I'm going to tell you what had a political impact on 2022, if anything does, it's going to be the attack on January 6th and then the subsequent denial to look in the mirror, tell the truth, take ownership for what we've done and recommit to tell the American people and Republican voters the truth. The Republican voter who has had their patriotism abused by somebody that simply wants to use it to maintain power.Raw and noble patriotism is beautiful and leaders should be inspiring that patriotism to defend democracy and not attack it.WALLACE:  Let me ask you about one Republican leader in Congress.Do you believe that it's a conflict of interest for House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy to do everything he can to oppose this panel, do you think it's a conflict of interest given that he would likely be called by a commission to testify about his various conversations with President Trump both on the day of the riot on January 6th and then subsequent to that?KINZINGER:  Well, I wouldn't say it's a conflict of interest because Kevin is the leader. There's probably a lot of people that are going to be subject to being called in front of any investigation on this, even criminal investigation.But I do think Kevin has failed to tell the truth to the Republicans and to the American people and it pains me to say. It's not like I enjoy standing up and saying this, but people, the 74 million voters that voted for Donald Trump, the belief -- a number of them that believe the election was stolen believe it because their leaders have not told them otherwise. The people they trust have either been silent or not told them the truth.That's where Kevin has failed, because he told the truth on January 13th, something around then, and then he went to Mar-a-Lago and said Donald Trump is the leader of the party. He's right. Donald Trump is the leader of the party, but we need to tell people the truth.WALLACE:  You talk about the politics in all this on the part of the Republicans who are trying to block the commission but you have set up a political action committee called ""Country First"" and part of the goal, maybe the central goal of ""Country First"" is to try and take the Republican Party back from Donald Trump.So, in effect, doesn't the January 6th commission serve your political purposes?KINZINGER:  No, not at all, because when I tell you, history is going to tell the truth anyway. It would be nice to confront that through January 6th commission. My whole thing with ""Country First"" -- and it's Country1st.com -- is just simply to say we owe the American people the truth.My very first video on there, I just say, look, the Republican Party has lost its way. This party that built the interstate system, that freed the slaves, you know, fought for the environment, is now the party that is engaged heavily in mass battles, anti-vaccination and whatever the outrage of the day is, including Dr. Seuss.All that may be important but there are much more important things for this country. And that's what we want to get back to, is putting the country before the party. And frankly, January 6th embarrasses me. That will in no way benefit me at all.WALLACE: Congressman Kinzinger, thank you. Thanks for sharing this weekend with us.And now let's turn to Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri. Senator, you're a member of the Republican leadership in the Senate. How confident are you that you're going to be able to block the creation of this commission in the Senate? SEN. ROY BLUNT (R-MO): Well, I think it's to too early to create a commission and I -- I believe Republicans in the Senate will decide that it's too early to -- to create that commission. You know, commissions often don't work at all. And when they do work, like the Simpson-Bowles Commission produced a good result, nothing happened as a -- as part of that result. The one commission that we generally think did work was the 9/11 Commission, Chris. I think that was -- I was part of putting that commission together. I think it was 14 months after 9/11, after all kinds of other information was out there for that commission to look at, before that commission got started. And, believe me, it would be months before this commission could get started. I just was part of the Senate Intel Committee looking into the last election, the Russian involvement in the last election. We thought that would take a year. It took three years. And we already had a full staff that was fully cleared to look at everything. It would take months, as Chairman Burr said the other day, former Chairman Burr of -- of our committee, would take months just to get a staff ready to look at things and you've got 400 plus legal efforts going on against individuals. That's going to produce a lot of information eventually. But, believe me, the Justice Department will not let a commission have any of that information. We just went through that with the -- with the 9 -- with the effort we looked at after the last election. We got no sharing from the Justice Department about a much smaller number of cases than they're dealing with now. This information is all going to get out there. I've actually opposed the idea of a commission from -- immediately from the very first because I think we'll start waiting for a commission rather than moving forward with what we know we need to do now. There's a bipartisan effort in the Senate with two committees to produce not only a report, but also a number of recommendations, and we should be able to do that in the first full week of June and we haven't even waited for that to decide what a commission should do. WALLACE: Well, let me ask you about that. You are working with two committees, Senate Rules and Senate Homeland Security. Both, of course, chaired by Democrats because they're in the majority.BLUNT: Right.WALLACE: And, as you say, they're going to come out with a report, we think, as early as -- as next month. But the issue is whether or not they're going to answer -- and this is what Congressman Kinzinger said -- some of the key questions that a lot of people have about January 6th. I want to put those up on the -- on the screen. What was President Trump doing during the riot? Did he refuse to approve sending in the National Guard? Did White House staff and the military work around Mr. Trump with Vice President Pence? Will your report, with those two committees, will they answer those questions, and have you talked, have you subpoenaed, or have you heard from top officials in the Trump White House? BLUNT: Well, we had two public hearings and we've had several individual interviews with people like the acting secretary of defense, the -- the secretary of the Army. There's going to be a timeline that will come out that -- that talks about what happened, when it happened. There will be plenty of answers to the questions, I think, of why we had that 30 minute gap between the time that the Defense Department says they approved National Guard assistance and the time they told the National Guard that they'd approved that assistance. WALLACE: But -- but, sir, what about --BLUNT: There are some questions there, but -- WALLACE: I -- I don't mean to interrupt, but what about what was going on inside the Trump White House? BLUNT: Well, I -- I think you've got to decide, what's the priority here? Is the priority to secure the Capitol, to do what we need to do to better train, better prepare Capitol Police, decide what we want to do in the future, or is the priority to take what will be a of couple years, in my view, to decide what happened inside the White House? I think that ultimately will be out there. All kinds of books being written, all kinds of efforts to look at that. Even a commission like the 9/11 Commission started at the right time with the information they need, won't get in the way of us doing what we need to do. But if we start a commission right now, just last week many people in the press were saying about our report that will come out, it will be bipartisan, it will be something that -- that Chairman Klobuchar, Chairman Peters, Rob Portman and I all will have signed off on. WALLACE: Right.BLUNT: When that comes out, people are saying, well, maybe we should wait until we get a report from the commission. I don't think we should wait for another year or so to decide what we need to do to respond to 9/11. WALLACE: Well, I -- but you keep talking about the 9/11 Commission. The -- the two chairs of the 9/11 Commission, one Republican, one Democrat, they put out a statement this week and -- and here's what they said. They support creation of this panel, saying, unity of purpose was key to the effectiveness of the group, the 9/11 Commission. We put country above party without bias. I -- you know, I don't think many people or anybody is saying that your committees can't do their work. The question is whether the -- a -- a commission, an independent commission, no members of Congress, could serve -- could serve a useful function. As you say, it may be a year from now before they comes out. Can you honestly say, in opposing this commission, down -- coming out down the line, that you're putting country above party? BLUNT: Well, I -- I think -- first of all, I think I said a minute ago what happened on 9/11. Obviously, what I meant what happened January 6th. Those are clearly, in my time in -- in the Congress, the two seminal moments were the -- were the -- the country, the capital city itself under an attack that we wouldn't have anticipated. But I -- I do think that the 9/11 Commission had a lot more information available to it when it started than this one would have and we made a lot of decisions before the 9/11 Commission started that were important to further secure the Capitol, to further look at our intelligence failures.WALLACE: Right.BLUNT: We need to be doing all of those things. We'll see what my colleagues think, but there have been very little bipartisan discussions between the House and Senate on this topic. WALLACE: Senator, I want to -- I've got about 30 seconds here, so I need a quick answer.You're part of a Republican group trying to come up with a deal with the White House over infrastructure. They're at $1.7 trillion. Yu guys are -- on the Republican side are around $600 billion. Even in Washington, that's a lot of money. What do you think of the prospects for a compromise, a bipartisan compromise on infrastructure? Thirty seconds. BLUNT: Well, I hope we can get there. I think our best meeting on this topic was the meeting we had with the president himself and the members and a couple of cabinet officers, the secretary of Commerce and the secretary of Transportation. I think the president would like to get there on a bipartisan deal. Our biggest gap is not the money. Our biggest gap is defining what infrastructure is. And if we get to a definition of infrastructure that the country would have always accepted, that becomes a much narrower space than it appears to be right now. I do think we've got about a week or ten days to decide if we can work together on this or not. I'd like to. I believe the president would like to. The number is too big because the scope of what the White House staff wants to call infrastructure is way too big. WALLACE: Right.Senator Blunt, thank you. Thanks for coming in today and we'll stay on top of what happens to the commission and the Senate. BLUNT: Thank you too (ph).WALLACE: Up next, we'll bring back our Sunday group to debate who's playing politics with this plan for an independent investigation.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): What is clear is that House Democrats have handled this proposal in partisan bad faith going right back to the beginning. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): Once again they are caving to Donald Trump and proving that the Republican Party is still drunk off the big lie. (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Senate Republican and Democratic leaders sharply divided over the idea of a commission to investigate the January 6th riot on Capitol Hill.And we're back now with the panel. So, Guy, which side do you think has the better side of this argument, the Republicans who it appears are going to be able to block the commission or Democrats were are pushing for it? GUY BENSON, TOWNHALL.COM, ""THE GUY BENSON SHOW"" AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, the Republicans may have the votes in the Senate, as Senator Blunt alluded to. In terms of the argument, I heard what Senator McConnell just said there. And one person who would disagree is the Republican ranking member on the Homeland Security Committee in the House who helped hammer out a bipartisan deal on this commission. And it's absolutely true that one way or another there's going to be an investigation by Congress into this attack on Congress, which was an extremely disgraceful moment in our history. The question is will it be bipartisan with each side having similar powers, not exactly the same, but the exact same number of people that they're responsible for appointing to it, or will it be a partisan, Democratic-involved situation on enterprise that Nancy Pelosi will run? And that's the point that Congressman Kinzinger made.So I really do think that this is an appropriate purview for Congress to look into. It's not ancient history. The hands of Congress are not tied to go do other things while a commission looks into everything that led up to and happened on that horrific day. And I think Republicans are really trying to just sort of move past it and look to 2022. I'm sympathetic to that. But I think 1/6 was bad enough that it requires real answers. WALLACE: Chuck, even if Republicans take a political hit in killing the commission, as it at least appears now they're going to do, couldn't you argue that it's still smarter politics than creating this panel, which is going to hold public hearings and bring the whole issue -- I understand if not it will be like a Benghazi commission, it will be set up just by one party, Nanny Pelosi in the House, but, you know, an independent commission has a real political downside to it as well for Republicans. CHARLES LANE, ""THE WASHINGTON POST"" AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: The independent commissions' political downside to the Republicans is that it has more credibility and, of course, this is a very bad story for the Republican Party. I think a lot of Republicans are afraid of what it will find out about their desperate but futile effort to get the president to do something about this mob that was coming for them.But, more importantly, I think they feel -- the Republicans feel that they have to move -- just like they had to squash Liz Cheney to change the subject, they have to squash this to change the subject so they have a clearer field in 2022. I just want to say that, you know, this is one where the Democrats are galvanized and united and have sort of logic and truth in their direction and the Republicans are divided and fighting against the pretty clear merits of the subject. WALLACE: Right. Julie, let's talk about this not from a political standpoint but from a substance standpoint. Are there some questions that -- about President Trump's role before the -- the riot or -- or during the day, January 6th, that it commission might be able to answer and that these congressional committees, and Senator Blunt made it clear they're not calling top officials from the Trump White House, that congressional committees are never going to be able to answer? JULIE PACE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, ""THE ASSOCIATED PRESS"": Absolutely. I think the commission would be the perfect venue to try to answer some of the unanswered questions. And most of those questions do focus on President Trump, focus on what he was doing on the 6th, what private conversations he was having with aides. We have snippets of details about conversations that he was having with some members of Congress and others but I do think that there's a real gap in the history of this seminal moment in our country's history that has gone unanswered. And so this commission would likely be the only real venue for being able to have a fair accounting of what transpired inside the White House and around President Trump on the 6th. WALLACE: Let's turn to another big issue that I touched on at the end of my interview with Senator Blunt, and -- and that's the question of a big infrastructure bill. President Biden keeps saying he wants a compromise. But at the end of this week, as I mentioned to -- to Senator Blunt, the White House is at $1.7 trillion and Democrats are about $600 billion. So they're more than a trillion dollars apart. Guy, what do you think of the chances they're able to -- to resolve that difference and also the difference of how they pay for it. Democrats want to raise taxes on corporations. Republicans don't. Or do you think in the end that the president and Democrats will end up going the straight party line reconciliation route in the Senate? BENSON: A trillion dollars plus apart. And a huge disagreement on taxes. A huge disagreement on scope, which I think was a key word from Senator Blunt in that interview. I think that there is some openness to bipartisanship on this on the Republican side. The White House has come down in their number a little bit. It's still astronomically high. The Republicans want to focus on traditional infrastructure, which I think makes sense. Maybe they'll get a little bit closer. I'm currently, based on what I'm seeing, what I'm reading, what I'm hearing, I'm more inclined to believe this is going to end up being a partisan exercise by the Democrats to sort of ram it through because the parties are so far apart. The one potential opportunity though, four senators, two from each party, put together a bipartisan bill on service infrastructure, roads and bridges and that sort of thing for $303 billion. If they go at this on a piecemeal basis, then perhaps there's more room, more wiggle room for bipartisanship. But I think the White House wants something big. WALLACE: Julie, I've got less than a minute. How do you think this infrastructure story ends? PACE: I think unless there's a significant shift in the dynamics this week, we're either going to go down a -- a purely partisan route where a big package gets passed only on Democratic votes or there is this potential opportunity to explore what Guy just outlined there, where you break up the bill into some smaller pieces. But the White House officials that I've talked to are very concerned that taking that route would actually cause a split within their own party where a lot of Democrats want to use this opportunity to do something big and so there's some weariness among White House officials about doing that, doing that second step.WALLACE: Well, we'll be talk about that a little bit longer. Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday. Up next, our ""Power Player of the Week,"" a D.C. landmark on surviving the pandemic and its special place in Washington history. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: As the country begins to get back to normal, a lot of us are looking forward to enjoying a meal at our favorite restaurant. In D.C., that includes a local landmark that has played a big role in the nation's capital for 63 years. Here's our ""Power Player of the Week."" (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)VIRGINIA ALI, OWNER, BEN'S CHILI BOWL: Well, we've faced many, many challenges. The pandemic has been truly the most challenging. Welcome to Ben's. How are you? WALLACE (voice over): Virginia Ali is the owner of Ben's Chili Bowl, a Washington institution that like so much was threatened by the pandemic. WALLACE (on camera): How hard did it hit your business? ALI: Oh, wow. I mean, we were open, Chris, from 7:00 in the morning until 2:00 a.m. and 4:00 a.m. on weekends. That came to a complete halt. WALLACE (voice over): Somehow Ben's made it work, doubling down on carry out and even starring in a Google commercial. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: People come here to see the photos on the wall, to meet the family. WALLACE: To understand the fuss about Ben's, you need to know its history. Ben and Virginia Ali were newlyweds when they opened the place in 1958. Folks came for the half smoke, a sizzling pork and beef sausage served with Ben's signature chili on top. ALI: He had this very special spicy chili recipe. You know, he came from Trinidad, where spicy foods was the thing. WALLACE: They were on U Street, known in the '50s as the black Broadway. ALI: All the clubs closed at 2:00 a.m. So from 2:00 a.m. to 4:00 a.m. you could barely get into the Chili Bowl on a Friday and Saturday night. And there was Duke Ellington, there was Pearl Bailey, Nat King Cole, everybody. WALLACE (on camera): That must have been some scene. What was that like? ALI: It was just a joyful time. I mean the music was going on the jukebox and we had these musicians coming in. We're just happy to see them. WALLACE (voice over): In the '60s, the civil rights movement took over, but Ben's was still a meeting place. ALI: Whenever Dr. King was in town, on occasion he would come down to the Chili Bowl, have a sandwich and I'd have an opportunity to sit with him and listen to him talk about his dream. WALLACE: But in 1968, King was assassinated. Much of U Street was burned down or boarded up. ALI: Ben's Chili Bowl was the only place that was allowed to remain open. That was scary. But we were not touched. WALLACE: In the decades since, Ben's has remained a landmark, an essential stop for African-American entertainers and politician, which brings us back to the food. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's so good, guys.WALLACE (on camera): Can you tell me what the secret is to the secret chili sauce? ALI: Well, that's our special chili sauce. That's our special recipe. We haven't given that out yet. But you'll be the first to get it, Chris. When we do, you'll be the first to get that recipe. WALLACE (voice over): With D.C.'s COVID restrictions finally lifted, customers are coming back to Ben's and they can still find Virginia Ali at the grill. ALI: I like to turn them one at a time. WALLACE: Cooking up those half smokes. WALLACE (on camera): Why are you still working? ALI: I don't know that I call it work. When you do something that you enjoy, it's not so hard. And you've been coming for 25 years.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.ALI: That's pretty cool. And meeting people, Chris, from all walks of life, just at Ben's Chili Bowl. I just have a good time every day. (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: If you want to check out that special secret chili sauce, Virginia says there are plans to start bottling it and putting it on a shelf in your grocery store. And that's it for today.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu said he is willing to risk ""friction"" with the U.S. to prevent Iran from going nuclear if it moves forward with reinstating the Iran nuclear deal. The now-contested leader, coming off an 11-day war with Hamas, said a nuclear Iran remains the biggest threat to Israel.  ""If we have to choose – I hope it doesn’t happen – between friction with our great friend the United States and eliminating the existential threat – eliminating the existential threat"" wins, Netanyahu said.""I’ve told this to my friend for 40 years, Joe Biden, and I said to him, ‘With or without a deal, we will continue to do everything in our power to thwart the armament of Iran with nuclear weapons,'"" Netanyahu said at a ceremony for David Barnea, the incoming head of Mossad, Israel’s external intelligence agency. Netanyahu’s remarks come as the U.S. has been participating in talks to reinstate the 2015 deal, a campaign promise of President Biden, in Vienna, Austria. The Jewish state leader has been a vocal opponent of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which relieves Iran of sanctions in exchange for perceived curbs on nuclear activity. IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL: HIGH-LEVEL TALKS RESUME ""I can tell you that I hope that the United States will not go back to the old JCPOA because we believe that that deal paves the way for Iran to have an arsenal of nuclear weapons with international legitimacy,"" Netanyahu said last week. Israel also says any deal must address Iran’s support for militant groups, such as Hamas. The terror group told its Iranian backers ""our factories and workshops have resumed production of thousands of missiles to stop the [attacks] of Netanyahu in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv,"" said Fathi Hamad, a member of Hamas’ politburo, according to Iran’s state-run Fars News Agency. Meanwhile, Iran claims its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only and says the nuclear deal should be reinstated without any changes. NETANYAHU SAYS US SHOULD STAY AWAY FROM IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL The U.S. pulled out of the landmark 2015 deal in 2018 after President Donald Trump said the pact needed to be renegotiated. He then reimposed heavy sanctions on the Islamic republic in an unsuccessful attempt to bring Tehran into new talks.Iran reacted by steadily increasing its violations of the deal, which is intended to prevent the country from obtaining nuclear weapons. Iran began enriching uranium to a greater purity, stockpiling more than allowed, and began to use more advanced centrifuges in an attempt to pressure the world powers remaining in the deal — Germany, France, Britain, Russia and China — for economic relief.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPBoth Iran and U.S. have asserted that the other must make the first move.

He lived in the United States for a brief period as a child and like Netanyahu, speaks fluent English, according to Reuters.Like most Israelis, Bennett served in the military, in a reconnaissance unit as a squad and company commander. By 1999 he cofounded an anti-fraud software company Cyota and moved to New York. He later sold the business to an American company for $145 million.

But by refusing to commit to Netanyahu or his opponents, Bennett positioned himself as kingmaker. Even after one member of his religious nationalist party abandoned him to protest the new coalition deal, he ended up with the crown.Here's a look at Israel's new leader:  Israel's new prime minister, Naftali Bennett, raises his hand during a Knesset session in Jerusalem Sunday, June 13, 2021.

(Morteza Fakhri Nezhad/ Young Journalists Club, YJC via AP). Raisi was one of a number of officials sanctioned by the U.S. government in 2019 over human rights abuses. The Treasury Department cited U.S. reports that, under Raisi, the judiciary had sanctioned the execution of child offenders and arrested lawyers for defending political prisoners and human rights defenders.Raisi previously served as prosecutor general of Tehran between 1989 and 1994 as well as the first deputy head of the judiciary between 2004 and 2014. The U.S. government has noted his involvement in what it described as a ""brutal"" crackdown on Iran’s Green Movement protesters following the 2009 election.Dissidents have zeroed in on his role in a ""death commission"" that ordered the executions of thousands of political prisoners in 1988. Iranian political prisoners were asked to identify themselves and those who responded ""mujahedeen"" were sent to their deaths, while others were questioned about their willingness to ""clear minefields for the army of the Islamic Republic,"" according to a 1990 Amnesty International report. Estimates for how many were killed range from 5,000 to 30,000.When Raisi was appointed head of the judiciary in 2019, then-deputy State Department spokesman Robert Palladino called the move a ""disgrace.""""Ebrahim Raeesi, involved in mass executions of political prisoners, was chosen to lead #Iran’s judiciary.

The security presence around the building was much smaller than past sessions, when Netanyahu was the prime minister. His lawyers immediately asked that Tuesday's session be delayed following reports that another witness had come forward with new evidence alleging that Netanyahu's wife, Sara, had accepted an expensive bracelet as a gift from two billionaire friends, Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan and Australian billionaire James Packer. Netanyahu's lawyers argued that the former prime minister and his wife were caught off-guard by the allegations and had the right to study the evidence before Hefetz took the stand. After a short recess, the court accepted the request and postponed Hefetz's testimony until next Monday. Several dozen supporters waited for Netanyahu outside the building, with one man shouting at journalists ""we'll throw you in the trash."" Netanyahu has been accused of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate cases. The first involves Netanyahu allegedly receiving gifts worth hundreds of thousands of dollars from wealthy friends, including Milchan and Packer. In the second case, Netanyahu is accused of orchestrating positive coverage in a major Israeli paper in exchange for promoting legislation that would have harmed the paper's chief rival. The third one, nicknamed Case 4000, entails Netanyahu allegedly passing legislation worth hundreds of millions of dollars to the owner of Israeli telecom giant Bezeq in exchange for positive coverage on its Walla news site.   Former Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, left, arrives for a court hearing on corruption charges on Tuesday, Nov. 16, 2021, in Jerusalem.  (Jack Guez/Pool Photo via AP)In 2018, after he was arrested by police in connection with Case 4000, Hefetz signed a state’s witness deal and provided investigators with recordings of conversations with Netanyahu and his family. But because of his close connection with the former prime minister, Hefetz's testimony is likely to be relevant to all three cases. The former prime minister has denied any wrongdoing. As prime minister, Netanyahu long rejected calls to step down while under indictment, using his position to lash out at law enforcement, the media and the courts. But Netanyahu failed to win reelection in four consecutive elections, with voters deadlocked over his leadership and trial.

An election is likely to take place in late October or early November.A poll taken by Israeli TV’s Channel 12 News immediately following Bennett’s announcement on Wednesday showed Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud party gaining at least 15 seats more than its closest rival and gaining enough support from other right-wing factions and those loyal to the former leader to form a government with a small majority.In a brief televised statement from Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, Bennett said, ""I do not intend to compete in the coming elections but will remain a loyal soldier in the service of this country.""ISRAELI PARLIAMENT'S COALITION CHAIR RESIGNS, OPENING DOOR TO NEW ELECTIONS, BIBI NETANYAHU COMEBACK  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, left, and Defense Minister Naftali Bennett, visit an Israeli army base in the Golan Heights, on the Israeli-Syrian border, Sunday, Nov. 24, 2019. (Atef Safadi/Pool via AP)""The state of Israel is the love of my life,"" said Bennett, who entered into office a year ago heading a broad government coalition made up of eight parties spanning the political spectrum and including for the first time an Arab-Israeli party. Ultimately, it was the clash of ideologies that brought Bennett’s coalition to an end last week. Israel’s parliament is expected to be dissolved on Thursday and be replaced with a caretaker government led by Bennett’s coalition partner, Yair Lapid, who will run the country through what is expected to be a fraught four-month election period. Lapid, a former journalist and media personality, stands apart from other Israeli prime ministers as he does not have a strong military background and did not graduate from high school. Unlike other Israeli prime ministers, Lapid served as a correspondent for an army magazine during his compulsory military service before becoming a newspaper reporter and eventually a regular face on Israeli TV screens, including hosting the nightly news.   Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, right, and Foreign Minister Yair Lapid attend a cabinet meeting at the Prime Minister's office in Jerusalem, June 19, 2022.  (Abir Sultan/Pool Photo via AP, File)However, being in the top office as Israelis head to the polls will put Lapid, who for the past year has served as Foreign Minister and Alternate Prime Minister, in a prime position to showcase his political skills and go head-to-head with his main rival, Netanyahu. NETANYAHU WARNS IRAN COULD ‘TAKE THE ENTIRE WORLD HOSTAGE’ IF WEST APPROVES NEW NUKE DEALAs interim prime minister, Lapid will be the one to meet with President Joe Biden when he makes his first visit as president to Israel next month and might also be the one to work with the White House as it encourages normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia, which the president also intends to visit during his Middle East trip. Biden is also expected to meet with Netanyahu, who formally heads the opposition in Israel’s parliament. The two leaders have a long but temperamental relationship. When Biden visited Israel as vice president in 2010, while Netanyahu was prime minister, an announcement of new settlements in East Jerusalem created a crisis between the two leaders.Since 2019, Israeli leaders, including Netanyahu, have struggled to form a stable coalition government because of the fragmented nature of the country’s parliamentary system, which allows a host of small parties and requires that the government controls a majority of the seats. Bennett struggled over the past three months to keep his coalition together after members of his own faction quit over ideological differences.   FILE PHOTO: U.S. Vice President Joe Biden (L) shakes hands with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as they deliver joint statements during their meeting in Jerusalem March 9, 2016.

President Biden appeared to quickly drop his ""no handshake"" policy during his Middle East tour, leading some to speculate that the White House adopted the policy merely to avoid a politically uncomfortable encounter later in the trip. White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan announced Wednesday that the president would avoid shaking hands during the four-day trip out of an abundance of caution due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The president appeared to abide by the policy when he arrived in Israel, greeting Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid and other officials with fist bumps. But not long after that Biden shook hands with former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu – all while not wearing a facemask or taking COVID-19 precautions of any kind. Biden visited Madrid in June to attend a G7 conference during a time when the city's COVID-19 cases had reached a rolling 7-day average of over 2,000 new cases. During that time, Biden had no problem shaking hands and getting close and personal with a range of leaders from across the globe, including Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan - a man who has been condemned for his country's crackdown on human rights activists, as well as clamping down on press freedom, and the arrest and harassment of journalists.ISRAEL'S BEN GURION AIRPORT WELCOMES BIDEN, AIR FORCE ONE UPON ARRIVALThe handshake with Netanyahu has led some to believe that the White House policy has nothing to do with COVID-19 and everything to do with avoiding a bad press moment with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia. The White House and State Department did not respond to requests for comment or clarification.   President Joe Biden shakes hands with former Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu despite a White House advisory that the president would avoid handshakes due to COVID-19 concerns.  (Gideon Marcowicz/TPS)Biden will fly to Jeddah and meet with King Salman and the Crown Prince on Friday, according to the New York Times. The apparent flip-flop on his handshake policy will only heighten attention to how the world leaders will greet each other. The White House this week insisted that the trip aimed to ""advance American interests,"" denying that the president had gone to the Middle East to push leaders in OPEC to increase oil production as the world continues to face a fuel crisis. HALEY SAYS BIDEN EFFORTS TO REVIVE IRAN DEAL ‘SLAP IN THE FACE’ TO ISRAEL, ARAB ALLIES""I'm saying it's not, it’s not, it's not the focus,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Monday, adding that it is ""not… on the agenda.""""That’s something for OPEC to decide, clearly.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.Israel’s parliament voted Thursday to dissolve itself, marking the end of a year-old experimental coalition government, and sending the country to the polls in November for the fifth time in less than four years.Yair Lapid, Israel’s foreign minister and architect of the outgoing coalition government, will become the country’s caretaker prime minister just after midnight on Friday. He will be the 14th person to hold that office, taking over from Naftali Bennett, Israel's shortest serving prime minister.Following the vote, Lapid embraced Bennett before the two swapped chairs. He posted, ""thanks, Naftali, my brother"" on Twitter.The government collapsed just over a year after it was formed in a historic move that saw longtime leader Benjamin Netanyahu ousted after 12 years in power by a coalition of ideologically diverse parties, the first to include an Arab faction.ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENNETT ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT FROM POLITICS, PAVING THE WAY FOR NETANYAHU’S RETURNThe motion to dissolve passed with 92 lawmakers in favor, and none against, after days of bickering by coalition and opposition lawmakers over the date of new elections and other last-minute legislation.New elections will be held on Nov. 1.The move brings a formal end to a political experiment in which eight parties from across the Israeli spectrum tried to find common ground after a period of prolonged gridlock in which the country held four elections in two years.

The four deadlocked elections in the previous three years were largely referendums on Netanyahu’s fitness to serve while facing charges of accepting bribes, fraud and breach of trust. Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing.Lapid, a former talk-show host who heads a center-left party, is expected to campaign as caretaker prime minister to keep the job as the main alternative to Netanyahu, and will likely get an early boost when he welcomes President Joe Biden to the country next week.ISRAEL CALLS FOR NEW ELECTIONS ONE MONTH BEFORE BIDEN VISITPolls by Israeli media show Netanyahu and his allies are projected to gain seats, although it is unclear whether they would have enough to form a 61-seat majority in the 120-member Knesset. If neither he nor anyone else succeeds in doing so, Israel could go to elections yet again.On Wednesday, Bennett said he would be taking a hiatus from politics and would not be running in the upcoming elections. His Yamina party was riven by infighting and splintered following the formation of the government last year as its members broke away in protest of what they considered Bennett’s excessive compromises to more liberal coalition allies.

We believe that Israel needs to uproot terror organizations such as Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades, just as the United States defeated al Qaeda. Like millions of Americans, we believe that peace comes through strength and that Israel’s policies should be based upon the firm enforcement of our right to sovereignty and self-defense.""In response to the warnings from Menendez, Netanyahu said at a press conference last week in Tel Aviv, ""I would have expected them to warn us of a government that depends on the Muslim Brotherhood who support terrorism and Ahmad Tibi and Ayman Odeh. Odeh said that [Hassan] Nasrallah (Hezbollah) is a hero, after that is it any wonder that Lapid ran to sell him the gas of the citizens of Israel?""Netanyahu was referring to Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid who is the midst of working through a controversial gas deal with Lebanon. Ahmed Tibi and Ayman Odeh are Israeli Arab politicians.A spokesperson for Menendez declined to comment in response to a Fox News Digital press query. The U.S. State Department did not answer a media query.However, Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., who is considered pro-Israel, tweeted, ""As Israel heads toward another election in November, I urge Israeli political leaders from all sides of the political spectrum to ostracize extremists like Ben-Gvir whose outrageous views run contrary to Israel’s core principles of a democratic and Jewish state.""While supporters of Ben-Gvir claim he has reformed his ways, his appeal has not spilled over into the center of Israeli politics, according to professor Tamar Hermann, a senior researcher for the Israeli Democracy Institute. ""He [Ben-Gvir] is still a pariah in the center [and] on the left."" Hermann also noted that he was legitimized by Netanyahu and other politicians on the right.

""Ben-Gvir is not at the far end of Israeli politics because of the radicalization that has happened"" after May 2021, said Hermann.During May 2021, Hamas terrorists launched rockets into the Jewish state while Arabs rioted in Israeli cities, which included arson attacks on synagogues. According to Hermann, the events of May 2021 sparked a radicalization among Israeli Arabs and Israeli Jews.RIOTS ERUPT IN PARTS OF ISRAEL AS TENSIONS FLAREBen-Gvir has significant support among the ultra-orthodox, mainly Sephardi voters, who are ""very enthusiastic"" about his message that ""appeals to chauvinistic views of Jews in the state of Israel,"" said Hermann. ""They are looking for a strong leader.""In late August polls from Israel's three major TV networks revealed that Ben-Gvir's party could secure between eight and nine seats in Israel's parliament if elections were conducted straight away. The dramatic rise of Ben-Gvir in the election process has not rolled back since the August poll, according to Israeli public opinion experts like Hermann.Bezalel Smotrich, the chief of the Religious Zionist Party, which formed a voting block with Ben-Gvir, told the Israeli media that Ben-Gvir has positioned himself to be a senior minister in the next government.""I hope we will be the third-largest party in the state of Israel,"" said Smotrich.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.Israel’s prime minister said Tuesday that the country has reached a ""historic agreement"" with neighboring Lebanon over their shared maritime border after months of U.S.-brokered negotiations.The agreement, coming after several years of U.S.-mediated talks, would mark a major breakthrough in relations with the two countries, which formally have been at war since Israel's establishment in 1948. But the deal still faces some obstacles, including key legal and political challenges in Israel. There was no immediate confirmation by Lebanon that a deal had been reached.At stake are rights over exploiting undersea natural gas reserves in areas of the eastern Mediterranean that the two countries — which do not have diplomatic relations — claim.Premier Yair Lapid called the deal an ""historic achievement that will strengthen Israel’s security, inject billions into Israel’s economy, and ensure the stability of our northern border.""   In this photo released by Lebanon's official government photographer Dalati Nohra, Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Makati, right, receives the final draft of the maritime border agreement between Lebanon and Israel from his deputy Elias Bou Saab who leads the Lebanese negotiating team, in Beirut, Lebanon, Tuesday, Oct. 11, 2022. (Dalati Nohra via AP)3 PALESTINIANS ARRESTED FOLLOWING DEADLY ATTACK ON ISRAELI SECURITY CHECKPOINT, MANHUNT ON GOINGThe agreement is expected to enable additional natural gas production in the Mediterranean. Lebanon hopes gas exploration will help lift its country out of its spiraling economic crisis.Lebanon and Israel both claim some 860 square kilometers (330 square miles) of the Mediterranean Sea. Under the agreement, those waters would be divided along a line straddling a strategic natural gas field.According to a senior Israeli official, Lebanon would be allowed to produce gas from that field, called ""Qana,"" but pay royalties to Israel for any gas produced from the Israeli side. Lebanon has been working with the French energy giant Total on preparations for exploring the field.The agreement would also leave in place an existing ""buoy line"" that serves as a de facto border between the two countries, the official said. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was discussing behind-the-scenes negotiations.ISRAEL CLEARS ITSELF IN 7-YEAR-OLD PALESTINIAN BOY'S DEATHMany leading security figures, both active and retired, have hailed the deal because it could lower tensions with Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group, which has repeatedly threatened to strike Israeli natural gas assets in the Mediterranean.With Lebanon now having a stake in the region's natural gas industry, experts believe the sides will think twice before opening up another war.The two sides fought a monthlong war in 2006, and Israel considers the heavily armed Hezbollah to be its most immediate military threat.""It might help create and strengthen the mutual deterrence between Israel and Hezbollah,"" said Yoel Guzansky, a senior fellow at Israel's Institute for National Security Studies. ""This is a very positive thing for Israel.""The final draft of the agreement will be brought before Israel’s caretaker government for approval this week ahead of the Nov. 1 election, when the country goes to the polls for the fifth time in under four years.

Former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has said the caretaker government has no authority to sign such an important agreement and has vowed to cancel the deal if re-elected. On Tuesday, he accused Lapid of caving in to Hezbollah threats.""This is not a historic agreement.

JERUSALEM – Former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu looked set to return to power on Wednesday after an unprecedented fifth general election in less than four years on Tuesday gave his Likud Party, and others loyal to him, a narrow majority in the country’s parliament, the Knesset. A victory for the longest-serving Israeli leader, who was ousted to the opposition more than a year ago, means he will now be able to form a stable and ideologically aligned coalition, which critics are already calling the most right-wing government in Israel’s 74-year history. With close to ninety percent of the votes counted it looks like the Likud leader will be asked to form the next government.In his celebratory speech as the results became clearer, Netanyahu thanked those who supported him and called the win a ""massive vote of confidence from the Israeli public."" He also declared he would form a coalition with the ""national camp,"" a collection of controversial right-wing religious and ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties that have committed to join him in forming a strong and stable government. NETANYAHU PLOTS RETURN AS ISRAELIS VOTE FOR NEW GOVERNMENT  Benjamin Netanyahu is on the verge of becoming Israel's next prime minister.

(AP Photo/Maya Alleruzzo)""The way I see it is that this is the biggest political victory that Netanyahu has ever achieved, at least since his first victory in 1996 and at least in terms of the numbers, Aviv Bushinsky, a political commentator and a former chief of staff for Netanyahu, said in an interview with journalists. In the days leading up to the vote, Netanyahu traveled the length and breadth of the country urging the Israeli public to go out and vote after predictions of public fatigue and apathy suggested there would be a low turnout at the polls. His hard work appeared to pay off Tuesday, with official figures showing Israeli voting patterns were the highest in 20 years and many of those casting ballots came from the right of the political map. Also giving him a massive boost was the rise of a once-marginalized far-right nationalist conglomeration of parties united under the banner of Religious Zionism. The faction, which looks set to become the third-largest party in the Knesset, is now the potential kingmaker of this election with the power to crown Netanyahu prime minister. ISRAEL ELECTION: PRELIMINARY RESULTS SHOW NETANYAHU POISED TO RETURN TO POWER   Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich are expected to be part of any new government led by Netanyahu.

Kahana was assassinated by a terrorist in New York in 1990. Both men have sparked controversy in Israel and abroad for their extremist views, particularly towards Israel’s Arab population and over plans to reform the country’s judicial system, which they claim is corrupt, biased and far too powerful. While Israel’s parliamentary system means that no single political party can win an election outright, the largest party is usually the one afforded the first chance to try forming a coalition with other factions. It is a complicated jigsaw of smaller parties that typically align with similar ideologies. However, Netanyahu, who is also embroiled in a high-profile criminal trial over allegations of breach of trust, bribery and fraud, has struggled over the past four years to put together an ideologically aligned coalition as many of his traditional allies have refused to overlook his legal woes. ISRAEL ELECTION: WITH DIVISIONS DEEPENING, ISRAELIS TO DECIDE IF NETANYAHU SHOULD RETURN TO POWERNow, however, Netanyahu has the option of joining forces with Religious Zionism, which he has committed to doing so throughout his campaign, despite concerns raised by Israel’s supporters in the United States, including the administration of President Biden.   Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid's Yesh Atid Party trailed behind Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Party as votes continue to be counted in Israel's election.

""It's like, I'm not anti-American, I just don't think you should be an American.""Netanyahu secured a third run as prime minister of Israel after his coalition secured a majority in November's election. His return to power comes at a time when antisemitism is on the rise across the world: Antisemitic incidents reported in the United States reached an ""all-time high"" in 2021, with an average of seven incidents per day, according to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL). CHARGES ANNOUNCED OVER THREATS TO NJ SYNAGOGUES, SUSPECT HAD HISTORY OF ANTI-JEWISH SENTIMENTIn 2019, a study found that 25% of Europeans hold antisemitic beliefs, which ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt called ""deeply concerning.""

(Video: Ariel Tanaami/TPS.) Israelis go to the polls on Tuesday to elect a new government. Netanyahu is once again hoping to become prime minister. (Credit: Ariel Tanaami/TPS.)JERUSALEM – Tuesday could be a big day for former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. As Israelis returned to the polls for a fifth time in less than four years, the former Israeli leader is growing increasingly hopeful that a whirlwind election campaign and more than a year in opposition will be enough to propel him back into power.However, his path to the premiership is complicated. First by the fact that he is currently embroiled in a high-profile criminal trial that includes charges of bribery, fraud, and breach of trust, and secondly by the other political parties he might need in order to build his future coalition, which includes a faction made up of controversial far right-wing politicians.Netanyahu, the longest-serving leader in Israel’s history, was ousted in the last round of voting in March 2021. Since then, he has watched from the opposition bench as his rivals – first Naftali Bennett and now Yair Lapid – ran the country with a fragile government coalition that included, for the first time ever, a controversial party from the country’s minority Arab sector. In an interview on Friday with Fox News Digital, Netanyahu said that he felt confident he could win this election and return to power with a more solid and ideologically aligned government.   Supporters of Benjamin Netanyahu take part in a rally Oct. 28 in support of the former prime minister.

They’re actually part of the existing coalition that was unraveled and that is unfathomable because these people don't recognize the Jewish state and they support the terrorists who seek to murder Israelis."" Netanyahu said he believed that many Israelis wanted to see him return, leading a government that is ""committed to Israel as a Jewish state"" and ""to restoring a powerful economy and a powerful military and security for all Israelis."" Netanyahu’s confidence about returning to power is reflected somewhat in polls published over the past few weeks that show he might have an easier time getting re-elected than Yair Lapid, who has served as interim prime minister since June, when Bennett announced his withdrawal from Israeli politics after calling the election five months ago. However, he also faces a myriad of challenges that could leave him permanently ousted.  While Israel’s fragmented parliamentary system means that no single political party can win an election outright, the polls suggest that a group of right-wing, religious parties that have committed to supporting Netanyahu’s leadership bid could collectively garner the requisite number of seats in Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, to form the next government.   Likud Party head and former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks to his supporters as he visits at Hatikva Market in Tel Aviv, Israel, Friday, Oct. 28, 2022, during his campaign ahead of the country's election.

Polls published Friday, the final day polling is allowed under the law, show Netanyahu and the parties committed to his return reaching only 60 – although with a margin of error and final days of intensive campaigning that number could certainly rise.  ""Any small changes in the vote choice between the camps or within the camps can have a significant impact,"" said Dr. Liron Lavi, a lecturer in the Department of Political Studies at Bar Ilan University. Additionally, Lavi pointed out that while Netanyahu might certainly choose to form a government with the parties that have backed him through the campaign – two ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties and a nationalist religious party – if his own Likud Party succeeds in garnering a larger number of voters, he would be better positioned to negotiate an alternative coalition, possibly with the party headed by the current Defense Minister Benny Gantz.   President Biden is greeted by Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid, and President Isaac Herzog, left, as during Biden's visit to Israel in July 2022.

""In this election, however, the size of the party is crucial, especially for Likud, because a large Likud will give Netanyahu the flexibility to choose his coalition partners."" Netanyahu has faced criticism both within Israel and outside for saying he is willing to include the national religious party – Religious Zionism – in a future coalition. The confab, which consists of three far-right parties, features characters such as Itamar Ben-Gvir, a disciple of the American Rabbi and Knesset Member Meir Kahana, who was assassinated by a terrorist in New York in 1990, and Bezalel Smotrich, a former Transport Minister, who is an outspoken advocate for Israeli settlement on lands Palestinians hope for a future state. ISRAEL ELECTION: WITH DIVISIONS DEEPENING, ISRAELIS TO DECIDE IF NETANYAHU SHOULD RETURN TO POWER  Israeli far-right lawmaker and the head of the ""Jewish Power"" Party Itamar Ben-Gvir visits at Hatikva Market in Tel Aviv during his campaign ahead of the country's election on Nov.1 as Israel heads to its fifth election in under four years. (AP Photo/Oded Balilty)Ben-Gvir and Smotrich have come under fire in the past for derogatory comments toward the country’s minority Arab population, and both have declared far-reaching plans to overhaul the country’s judicial system, which they claim is corrupt, biased, and far too powerful. The two have also hinted at their willingness to halt the criminal proceedings against Netanyahu, a step that has those opposed to his return up in arms. When asked by Fox News about Ben-Gvir’s party joining his coalition, Netanyahu called the concern ""ridiculous."" ""I've had parties on my right, including a party of this same persuasion, and they didn't control the policy,"" Netanyahu told Fox. ""For God sakes, we're the biggest party I'm the prime minister, and we control policy."" ""I always questioned the people who level this question against me,"" he continued.""I said, Where were you when the current government has made a coalition with the Muslim Brotherhood that wants to see the disappearance of Israel and doesn't accept the United States as currently formed? How come you’re speaking of people who recognize the Jewish state, who support the IDF, or who have been cleared by our Supreme Court, which vets all the parties? It just doesn't make sense.""On Monday, with less than 24 hours to go until the polls open, Netanyahu made a dramatic announcement that he was growing concerned about voter turnout for those affiliated with Likud and called an emergency strategy meeting at his headquarters in Tel Aviv. His failure to win 61 seats for his bloc or increase the size of his Likud party could, this time, end his political career for good, some local pundits say.  VideoCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPJonathan Rynhold, who heads the Department of Political Studies at Bar Ilan University, said that there was a good chance of Netanyahu challenging the legitimacy of the election results if he did not get 61 seats. ""He will have seen that Trump did this and although I do not expect the equivalent of 6th Jan. in Israel, Netanyahu can cause a lot of chaos in the political system if he challenges the results,"" said Rynhold.

(Credit: Ariel Tanaami/TPS)JERUSALEM, Israel – As polls closed on yet another election day in Israel, millions of Israelis waited anxiously to see if, after five rounds of voting in less than four years, they would be able to finally choose a clear winner and produce a stable government to successfully run the country.Preliminary results show that former prime minister and current opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu might very well be that winner this time around. His bloc of right-wing, religious parties is slated to draw up to 62 seats, the number of mandates needed to form a majority in the 120-seat Knesset, Israel’s parliament. Yesh Atid, the party of Netanyahu’s main rival, interim Prime Minister Yair Lapid, appeared set to garner only 24 seats, according to the polls. The assortment of parties that would be willing to support him in forming an anti-Netanyahu government were only slated to reach 55 seats. Two key parties appeared as though they would not pass the electoral threshold. The final result of what could be the country’s most decisive election yet — bringing an end to an endless cycle of elections — will not be known for at least the next few hours and possibly the next few days or even weeks, if votes are contested. In addition, if any of the parties hovering at the electoral threshold do indeed break through, the final numbers could change dramatically.

Israel’s Central Election Committee said that overall voter turnout was the highest ever since the 1999 election — a vote that saw Netanyahu, in his first round as prime minister, defeated by former prime minister Ehud Barak. While Israel’s parliamentary system means that no single political party can win an election outright, the largest party is usually the one afforded the first chance to try forming a coalition with other factions. It’s a complicated jigsaw of smaller parties that typically align with similar ideologies. mostly relating to the conflict with the Palestinians.   Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid attends a cabinet meeting at the prime minister's office in Jerusalem, Sunday, Oct. 23, 2022.

It is these charges, which include activities involving lavish gifts and high-stakes business deals with millionaires and national infrastructure companies, that forced the former prime minister to first call an election in Dec. 2018. Breaking up his government four years ago, Netanyahu was hoping for a decisive election result that would shore up his support and prove that despite the criminal investigations, he was still beloved by a loyal public. Following an election in April 2019, however, he was unable to pull together a government, with key allies and political partners unwilling to overlook his legal woes. Netanyahu was forced to call an unprecedented second election five months later.   The Israeli-Arab vote was said to be lower this time around. Netanyahu recently told Fox News Digital that he and his party Likud are popular within the community.  (AP Photo/Mahmoud Illean)The September 2019 vote also produced no clear winner and no clear path for Netanyahu — or any other political leader — to establish a government and the country was forced to hold a third election in March 2020, which produced a short-lived coalition with current Defense Minister Benny Gantz. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThat shaky alliance lasted less than a year before a fourth election was held in March 2021, with Netanyahu’s rivals, including for the first time ever an Arab-Israeli political party, finally ousting him from power. Naftali Bennett, a former Netanyahu ally, became prime minister, with Lapid, serving initially as alternate prime minister. But internal disagreements — mainly over core ideological differences between the eight factions — led to that government's downfall in June. Tuesday’s vote appears to make it unlikely that such an alliance will arise again this time.  Ruth Marks Eglash is a veteran journalist based in Jerusalem, Israel.

MENENDEZ STAYS SILENTWhile most elections worldwide usually hinge on a group of undecided voters who stand somewhere in the middle of the political spectrum, in Israel the vote appears to hinge on those whose views are somewhere on the fringes.On the far right of Israel’s political spectrum lies the Religious Zionism party, a conglomeration of what some claim are extremist, once persona non-grata agitators who have tried to clean up their act to make inroads into Israel’s parliament. They have committed to supporting Netanyahu and Bibi, much to the chagrin of some Western governments and Jewish communities worldwide.

Former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saw ""eye to eye"" with President Donald Trump while he had a great ""divergence"" with President Barack Obama, he told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview.In his new memoir, ""Bibi: My Story,"" Netanyahu discusses many aspects of his personal and professional life, including his various relationships with presidents: he first held the office of prime minister during the Bill Clinton administration; he then started his second term during the Obama administration; and he stepped down a few months after current President Joe Biden took office.He told Fox News Digital that each president had ""certain qualities"" that allowed the relationships to exist, but he found that he had ""an overt divergence"" with Obama.""[Obama] believed that peace brings power, and I believe that power brings peace, and no less important, I believe that power maintains the peace,"" Netanyahu said. ""When you're dealing with undemocratic regimes, that's the only way you keep the peace.""WATCH: PUTIN STANDS TO REAP BENEFITS OF IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL WITH US, NETANYAHU SAYSBut he found Trump to be a president with whom he saw ""eye to eye"" and with whom he achieved ""great things"" for Israel, including the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and relocating the U.S. embassy there.""I credit him with that and with the recognition of Israel sovereignty in the Golan Heights, pulling out of the dangerous Iran deal, but I work and will continue to work with anyone that the American people elect for the betterment of all, both Americans and Israelis,"" Netanyahu said.

This is the 27th annual such meeting. It is attended by nearly 200 countries and a regional economic integration organization that are members of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, also known as the UNFCCC.Why is it called COP?The acronym COP stands for ""Conference of the Parties."" According to the UNFCCC, the COP is the decision-making body that is responsible for ""monitoring and reviewing"" the implantation of the convention.What happens at COP?This summit is meant to foster cooperation between the member nations to address climate change on a global scale. Leaders and their designates will meet to discuss their plans. It also allows them to refine those plans or develop new ones.Go to unfccc.int for a schedule of events for COP27.   03:22 Climate compensation, adaptation on this year's agenda at COP27 Dr. Steve Cohen, Senior Vice Dean for the School of Professional Studies at Columbia University, discusses COP27, which is underway in Egypt. Who is the US sending to COP27?President Joe Biden is scheduled to attend COP27 on Nov. 11, but a delegation of U.S. officials is being led to the conference by Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry. Among the high-level officials in the U.S. delegation is Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and Rick Spinrad, administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.HOW TO WATCH FOX WEATHER   02:19 Biden recaps climate change efforts at COP26 President Joe Biden recapped the efforts to address climate change that have been made during his two days at COP26.Who else is going to COP27?Since Egypt is hosting COP27, it’s no surprise that high-level officials of the Egyptian government will be in attendance.United Kingdom Prime Minister Rishi Sunak originally said after his recent appointment that he would skip COP27, but reversed course in the days leading up to the conference.""There is no long-term prosperity without action on climate change,"" Sunak said in a tweet. Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid reportedly pulled out of the conference amid an election that saw former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reelected.

During COP21, the Paris Agreement was adopted by the 196 member nations. The treaty seeks to limit global temperature increases to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) compared to pre-industrial levels.At COP26, some delegates said they felt the climate deal agreed to during the conference didn’t go far enough to clamp down on the drivers of climate change.

In a few moments, we are going to run our just-completed interview with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is out with a brand new book: ""Bibi: My Story."" It’s a great read.  Today, as you may know, is the fifth anniversary of the decision by former President Donald Trump to move the American embassy to Jerusalem. Prime Minister Netanyahu called that a crucial decision — indeed, he called it a biblical decision, going back 3,000 years — and we discussed how that decision was a major contributor to the peace agreement that came to be known as the Abraham Accords, which was completed a few years later. That was between the U.S., Israel, the UAE, Bahrain, Morocco, Sudan and Kosovo.  Now, the prime minister and I also talked about how his courageous speech before Congress, back in 2015, where he laid out his disagreements with the Obama administration regarding a nuclear deal with Iran and some other things — how that speech (which is a prominent part of Mr. Netanyahu's new book) may itself have laid the intellectual groundwork for the embassy move to Jerusalem and the Abraham Accords and a complete shift away from the central role of Palestine and toward a new peace in the Middle East based on diplomacy, trade and investment between Israel and its Arab neighbors.   Also, the prime minister and I spent some time talking about, you guessed it, free-market economics and how he was able to change Israel's socialist state into a capitalist one.   JAMIE DIMON WARNS INFLATION COULD DRAG US INTO RECESSION NEXT YEAR: 'IT COULD BE A HURRICANE' close      video Rep.

Steve Scalise provides insight on the omnibus spending bill on 'Kudlow.'Now, this began years ago when he was finance minister, and, yes, he held several meetings in New York with the late supply-side guru Jack Kemp and one Larry Kudlow. By the way, the prime minister acknowledged all that and then he relayed a story that Jack Kemp told him to do three things: cut taxes, cut taxes and cut taxes. But the Prime Minister, while taking that advice, added to it the need to cut the heavy hand of government in order to lighten the burden on free enterprise and entrepreneurship.  So, you’ve got limited government, spending cuts, tax cuts, deregulation — all that work to turn Israel into a dynamic, entrepreneurial, technology-led economy, whose per-capita GDP now exceeds France, the United Kingdom, Germany and a couple of others. On top of all that, Israel finally privatized its energy agency and guess what? It discovered vast natural gas reserves in the eastern Mediterranean, all of which shows the value of the free flow of trade and investment, alongside free markets, as the very foundation of peace through strength.   CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP     Israel flag with a view of old city Jerusalem and the KOTEL- Western wall (iStock / iStock)These are crucial lessons.

https://www.foxnews.com/world/netanyahu-iran-nuclear-deal-probably-dead-protests-reveal-regime-really-weak,fox,Netanyahu: Iran nuclear deal is 'probably dead'; protests reveal that ...," close      Video Fox News Digital interview with Netanyahu on Iran protests, nuclear deal, peace in region In an interview with Fox News Digital, former and likely future Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discusses protests in Iran, the future of the Iran nuclear deal, and peace between Israel and the Arab world.Recent actions from the Iranian government have been very telling about the state of the country's leadership and may have ended the possibility of a new nuclear deal, according to former and likely future Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Following the release of his new memoir, ""Bibi: My Story,"" Netanyahu sat down with Fox News Digital in a wide-ranging interview. A few weeks after his Likud Party was victorious in Israel's election, Netanyahu was skeptical about the future of the Iran nuclear deal in light of their continued nuclear-related activity – and how the world is seeing Iran use deadly force to crack down on anti-government protests.""It's probably dead because the entire world saw what the true face of this regime is,"" Netanyahu said. ""That's thanks to the extraordinarily brave Iranian women and men who took to the streets – who take to the streets – against this vicious, murderous and brutal regime. And I think people ask themselves, ‘Do we want the ayatollahs, who chant death to America, to have the weapons of mass death and the ballistic missiles to deliver them to any part on Earth?’ and the answer is of course not.""As the protests calling for an end to the Islamic regime have gone on, news came out that Iran was enriching uranium at an underground facility at a level approaching what is needed for a nuclear weapon. Asked if he is concerned that continued pressure from the demonstrations could make Iran more erratic, Netanyahu did not dismiss the idea but said the protests are exposing Tehran and showing the leadership's vulnerability.IRANIAN GENERAL ACKNOWLEDGES 300 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED IN UNREST DURING NATIONWIDE PROTESTS Video""I suppose so, but I think that it also highlights the fact that they’re really weak – that they govern only with basically the threat of murder,"" he said. ""And the people are showing remarkable resilience.""As an example of the resolve of the Iranian people, Netanyahu referenced the Iranian World Cup soccer team remaining silent during their national anthem before their first game of the tournament.WATCH MORE OF FOX NEWS DIGITAL'S INTERVIEW WITH BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: ON HIS NEW BOOK, RISING ANTISEMITISM, AND CRITICISM OF HIS COALITION PARTNERS Video""The whole world is watching, and the entire team refused to sing the anthem, not because they’re not Iranian patriots, because they are,"" he said. ""Because they know their country has been hijacked by this gang of theological thugs who govern simply by terror. And the fact that the entire world sees that I think has made the possibility of stopping Iran’s nuclear program and rolling back the tide of this horribly aggressive regime possible.""Netanyahu observed that both sides of the political spectrum are more united against Iran now than they had been before. Whether or not this results in actually stopping Iran, he said, ""depends on how much the community of like-minded nations unites"" to keep them from getting a nuclear weapon.Netanyahu said that in order to do this, both ""crippling sanctions"" and a military threat are needed. Regarding the latter, he said Israel is prepared to act regardless of U.S. approval, although he believes that there may now be a more ""forward-leaning American position on this matter.""US AND ISRAEL DISCUSS MILITARY DRILL TO SIMULATE CONFLICT WITH IRAN, PROXIESNetanyahu angered many American officials in 2015 when he accepted an invitation to appear before a joint session of Congress and speak against the Iran nuclear deal – against the position of then-President Barack Obama. Netanyahu said he respected Obama but disagreed with him on this issue. Going against the president at that time ""wasn’t an easy decision,"" Netanyahu said, but it was a decision he made out of concern for Israel’s survival.As it turned out, that speech may have helped lead to the one of the most remarkable regional developments in recent memory: emerging peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors.  Abraham Accords signing ceremony at the White House on Sept. 13, 2020. (Getty)""In the course of giving that speech in Congress, our delegation received calls from Gulf governments – Arab governments in the Gulf – who said, ‘We don’t believe what we’re seeing. We don’t believe that your prime minister is willing to take this stand against an American president. It’s very hard,'"" Netanyahu recalled. ""And that’s what led to meetings in 2015, clandestine meetings with Gulf Arab leaders … and that created the foundations for the Abraham Accords.""The Abraham Accords are the peace agreements Israel made with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan. Netanyahu hinted that more countries could join in the future, predicting that ""the best is yet to come.""WATCH MORE OF FOX NEWS DIGITAL'S INTERVIEW WITH BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: ON THE DOJ'S PROBE OF SHIREEN ABU AKLEH'S DEATH, AND HIS OWN POLITICAL COMEBACK VideoNetanyahu said that the developing peace with Arab nations debunked the long-standing myth that regional stability would not come until after Israel made peace with the Palestinians.2 US CITIZENS INJURED IN JERUSALEM DURING DEADLY TERROR ATTACK, AMBASSADOR SAYS""That’s inside out. My argument is the exact opposite: it’s outside in. Complete the circle of peace with the entire Arab world and then get to the Palestinians,"" Netanyahu said. ""And perhaps then we could have them abandon their idea that they’ll do away with the Jewish State once they recognize the right – not merely the fact, but the right – of Israel to exist as a Jewish state, then I think we’ll be well on the way to a solution with them as well.""The Israeli-Palestinian conflict had long been emblematic of a greater conflict between Israel and the Arab world, but that no longer seems to be the case as the local conflict continues despite Arab countries improving relations with the Jewish state. Most recently, Israel was hit by two explosions at Jerusalem bus stops, attacks that Hamas, the group in control of the Gaza Strip that the U.S. has on its list of designated terror organizations, praised, according to Reuters.

(Simon & Schuster)Hamas is backed by Iran, setting it apart from much of the Arab world. Netanyahu noted that ""the rise of Iran's threat"" was one of ""the foundations"" of the Abraham Accords, along with Israel's growing military and technological power.Another recent point of conflict between Israel and Palestinians involved the death of Palestinian-American Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh. Palestinians quickly blamed Israel, and Israel later stated that Abu Akleh was likely accidentally killed by gunfire from Israeli Defense Forces. The U.S. Department of Justice said they were going to investigate the matter. Current Prime Minister Yair Lapid came out against this, and Netanyahu echoed that sentiment.""Israel has its own investigatory powers,"" Netanyahu said, adding that the IDF has ""really meticulous internal mechanisms"" to handle such situations.""You would not want us to investigate an event in America if you had something happen, a similar tragedy happening in our military,"" Netanyahu said, adding that Israel has investigated and will continue to investigate Abu Akleh's death.ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER CALLS US INVESTIGATION INTO JOURNALIST'S KILLING A ‘GRAVE MISTAKE’Netanyahu himself has also drawn criticism from U.S. officials, including longtime supporter of Israel Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., over far-right members of the coalition that Netanyahu is looking to form to set up a new government that he would lead as prime minister. In particular, Menendez reportedly referenced the inclusion of individuals like Itamar Ben-Gvir.Critics have painted Ben-Gvir as a right-wing extremist for his connections and support of far right-wing elements in Israel, including the late Rabbi Meir Kahane, whose ultra-nationalist party was outlawed from running in subsequent elections for inciting racism against Arabs. Kahane was assassinated by a terrorist in Manhattan in 1990. Ben-Gvir said that Menendez's criticism was ""incorrect and mistaken.""Netanyahu said the criticism was not ""morally or logically consistent,"" calling out Menendez and others for being silent when his opposition aligned themselves with supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood. Netanyahu accused that group of supporting terror while his partners ""support the Jewish State.""Netanyahu's likely return to the prime minister's office comes nearly a year and a half after he was voted out. During his time away from office, he wrote a memoir, ""Bibi: My Story,"" in which he discusses his military and political career as well as his family, which includes Israeli hero Yoni Netanyahu, who died during a daring hostage rescue mission in Entebbe, Uganda, in 1976. VideoNetanyahu said that having time away from the prime minister's office ""renewed"" his energy to reenter the ""cruel"" world of politics.""The reason I came back to power is because I live a life of purpose. And my purpose is to protect the Jewish state and make sure that Israel has a … secure and prosperous existence for the decades to come,"" he said.Netanyahu also addressed a problem facing Jews worldwide: rising antisemitism. The issue has especially been impacting Jews in the U.S. in recent weeks following the spread of antisemitic comments and tropes by notable figures such as Kanye ""Ye"" West and NBA player Kyrie Irving.Asked about whether influential figures such as Ye and Irving could empower other antisemites, Netanyahu agreed that this is a concern.""Yes, I think that's clear,"" he said, calling antisemitism ""a chronic disease"" that ""changes its form"" over the 2,500 years that it has existed.""People look for a scapegoat,"" he said. ""You're a capitalist, you blame the Jews who are the communists. You're a communist, the Jews are the capitalists. You have a problem, blame the Jews.""CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPNetanyahu said the only real defense against antisemitism is to ""take a strong stance against it."" He also pointed out that the existence of the state of Israel gives Jews a means of defense, be it militarily, morally, politically or otherwise.""The rebirth of Israel was meant to give a defense against antisemitism,"" he said.Fox News's Benjamin Weinthal contributed to this report.

In July, U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price released the following statement:""After an extremely detailed forensic analysis, independent, third-party examiners, as part of a process overseen by the U.S. Security Coordinator (USSC), could not reach a definitive conclusion regarding the origin of the bullet that killed Palestinian-American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh. Ballistic experts determined the bullet was badly damaged, which prevented a clear conclusion.

(AP Photo/Maya Alleruzzo)""In addition to the forensic and ballistic analysis, the USSC was granted full access to both Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Palestinian Authority (PA) investigations over the last several weeks. By summarizing both investigations, the USSC concluded that gunfire from IDF positions was likely responsible for the death of Shireen Abu Akleh, The USSC found no reason to believe that this was intentional but rather the result of tragic circumstances during an IDF-led military operation against factions of Palestinian Islamic Jihad on May 11, 2022, in Jenin, which followed a series of terrorist attacks in Israel.""NORTH CAROLINA POWER OUTAGE: POLICE REQUEST SEARCH WARRANTS, FBI WANTS CELL PHONE RECORDS IN HUNT FOR SUSPECTSThe family of Abu Akleh has kept the issue alive, lobbying U.S. officials for a new investigation.""I deplore the loss of Shireen,"" said Secretary of State Anthony Blinken.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has vowed the U.S. will ""follow the facts"" on Shireen Abu Akleh's death. (Ezra Acayan/Getty Images, File)Over the summer, two dozen Democratic senators wrote to President Biden, asking for an independent investigation. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat from Maryland, signed the letter.""What we want is an independent investigation, and I would hope everybody would want to get to the bottom of this and get to the facts and wherever they lead,"" he told Fox News.At least one pro-Israel group has questioned the purpose of the FBI investigation, months after one was already completed by the IDF and USSC, and suggested that the DOJ was bowing to political pressure.""It's highly unlikely that any new information will be derived from a follow-up investigation. If anything, right now this appears to be politically motivated,"" said Jonathan Schanzer, a vice president of research at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington, D.C., think tank.   Israeli officials have pushed back on the FBI investigating the IDF.

Will you go?BREAM: And the high court is once again squarely in the middle of the debate over religion and LGBTQ rights.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Whether your views are the same on marriage or different, I'm standing for the right for all of us to speak freely.BREAM: We'll ask our Sunday panel about a case that tests the balance between the business owner's free speech and Colorado's anti-discrimination law.Plus --RONALD REAGAN, FORMER PRESIDENT: If we lose freedom here, there is no place to escape to. This is the last on earth.BREAM: How a Seminole speech by Ronald Reagan is prompting Republican stars to share their vision for the party's future.All, right now, on ""FOX News Sunday"".(END VIDEOTAPE)BREAM (on camera): You're looking live at the Air Force One Pavilion, at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California.Welcome to a special hour of ""FOX News Sunday"" from the Reagan National Defense Forum. Each year, national security leaders meet here to discuss threats the U.S. faces around the world, and this year, it comes amid critical political developments at home.President Biden sending his biggest signal yet that he is leaning towards a 2024 run, pressing the Democratic National Committee for a more favorable primary schedule.Georgia is one of the states in line to move up the list and it's the same state gearing up for a crucial Senate runoff in just two days.We begin in team coverage. Aisha Hasnie live from Atlanta, Georgia, with the latest on the ground in the Warnock-Walker runoff. But first to Lucas Tomlinson at the White House.Lucas, walk us through this potentially huge changes to the Democrats' 2024 calendar.LUCAS TOMLINSON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Shannon, President Biden finished fourth at the Iowa caucus in 2020. His victory in South Carolina helped propelled him to the White House and the man many say the most responsible for that win explaining the need for this new change.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. JAMES CLYBURN (D-SC): The person that has won the South Carolina primary has gone on to win -- with one exception -- the general election.(END VIDEO CLIP)TOMLINSON: The new primary order which still needs to be voted on by the full Democratic National Committee early next year would make South Carolina the first primary in early February of 2024, followed by New Hampshire and Nevada, then Georgia, followed by Michigan at the end of the month.President Biden made his case for the new calendar in a letter to the DNC rules committee, quote, we must ensure that voters of color have a voice in choosing our nominee. The Democratic Party has worked hard to reflect the diversity of America, but our nominating process does not. Many are noting the new order would potentially be advantageous to Biden himself if he runs again.This week at White House Tribal Nation Summit, President Biden offered the following boast and gave a hint about 2024.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: No one has ever done as much as president as this administration is doing.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Four more years!BIDEN: Oh, I don't know about that. Thanks. Thank you, thank you, thank you.(END VIDEO CLIP)TOMLINSON: Friday's jobs report beat expectation, but personal savings rates are lowest in over 15 years and sign high inflation continues to have across the country -- Shannon.BREAM: Lucas Tomlinson, reporting from the White House -- Lucas, thank you very much.Now, to Aishah Hasnie in Atlanta, Georgia.All right. Aishah, what about there? What are voters saying about these possible changes to the DNC calendar?AISHAH HASNIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, good morning to you, Shannon.Well, I can tell you that Democrats, Georgia Democrats are really grateful for the committee's decision here. In fact, the group writing this, that the decision reflects the Democratic Party's commitment to diversity and inclusivity and we are grateful for the committee's recognition. Now, all of this comes, of course, as Democrats here on the ground are trying to reelect incumbent Senator Raphael Warnock, who currently holds just a narrow lead, about four-point lead over Republican Herschel Walker in recent polling, despite a series of abortion and abuse allegations surrounding the football star.Now, more than a million Georgians have already cast their ballots early, Shannon, as voters know the stakes are high in this race. So, if Warnock wins, Senate Democrats who already have the majority, as you know, gain some wiggle room here that diminishes leverage the leverage that centrist Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema hold right now and also opens up a pathway for the president's agenda for the next two years.Now, if Walker wins, the GOP then gets equal representation on Senate committees. That's important to them. It also matters in the next election cycle when Democrats have nearly two dozen seats up for grabs as opposed to 10 Republican seats.And, of course, Shannon, this could also be a referendum on former President Trump who hand-picked Herschel Walker -- Shannon.BREAM: So, Aishah, Walker missed out on 200,000 voters. They split their ticket in favor of Governor Kemp, but then also Senator Raphael Warnock. How does Walker try to appeal to those voters?HASNIE: Great question, Shannon. You know, those split voters were the headline, the story in the general election. They're incredibly important to both of these candidates who are courting those particular voters.Herschel Walker is hoping that Governor Brian Kemp going to be able to help him woo those voters to vote for him at the polls on Tuesday because the governor is actually now campaigning for Walker.But time will tell. Of course Tuesday's results will tell if that strategy will in fact work. In the meantime, some Republicans, in fact, one conservative, as he was heading to go vote last week told FOX News that he didn't think that Herschel Walker was the best Republican candidate, but he'd rather see a Republican take the seat so voted for him -- Shannon.BREAM: Aishah Hasnie from Georgia -- Aishah, thank you very much.Well, I got reaction to Democrats proposed calendar change and biggest foreign policy challenges facing our country. when I sat down with two key senators here in California.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BREAM: Senators Ernst and King, welcome back to ""FOX News Sunday."" Good to have you.SEN. JONI ERNST (R-IA): Thank you.BREAM: We've got a lot of foreign policy to discuss, especially in this setting. But, first, some domestic -- let's talk about Iowa, long the first in the country for the political caucuses. President Biden now says the primary calendar needs to change to represent voters and Americans more broadly.The Republican Party of Iowa says the DNC and Joe Biden have just kicked off utter chaos. The president says Democrats are going to get a better candidate who's going to be more broadly interesting and somebody that is going to garner votes for them in the general.Should Republicans consider changing from Iowa?ERNST: Absolutely not, and I'm sorely --SEN. ANGUS KING (I-ME): What do you think she's going to say? Give me a break.BREAM: She's from the Iowa. I have to ask.ERNST: So, I am sorely disappointed that Democrats chose not to have Iowa as their first in the nation caucus. So, we have seen a number of pushes in the past to change this, I'm glad that Republicans are staying the course.And, you know, how I feel about this? I feel that Democrats have really given Middle America the middle finger.BREAM: Senator King?KING: I'm an independent. They can do what they want.(LAUGHTER)BREAM: You're one of --KING: I don't have a dog in this fight.BREAM: You do have a dog in the fight when it comes to cyber. You've been talking about that here at the Reagan Library. And there are a number of concerns on that front.But, one of the things that people across the aisle, our intel agencies are all sounding the alarm over is an app that millions of Americans have downloaded voluntarily and happily onto their phones, TikTok. ""Washington Post"" has a piece that says this: it's amassing compromising information on millions of Americans, which it can later use for national security or commercial espionage, and for strategic influence operations against our country.It's been banned in some places. India bans it. Should the U.S. consider that? How concerned are you?KING: I think we definitely should consider it. It's -- the problem is with China, there's no distinction between the government and private sector. Everybody works for the government one way or another. So, TikTok can say, well, we're an independent country. Nonsense.And the second piece, if the Chinese are really into stealing data and collecting data, and this is one huge way to do that and they're going to have every keystroke, everything you enter, every comment, it is very dangerous. And it's -- if this were Austria or Australia, I don't think we need to worry about it, but here's a country that's demonstrated propensity to intrude into our affairs and particularly to use cyber to do so.BREAM: And China is top of mind in a conversation here this weekend. Senator, what do you make of the ongoing protest there? What is appropriate role for the U.S. at this inflection point?ERNST: Well, I do think we should be encouraging those continuing protests in China. This is a country that because of such draconian measures, where they are welding people into their homes, not allowing them to come out. People are starving in their homes, their businesses.We need to continue to encourage pushback against that government. We need to have a loud voice in the United States, as well, making sure we are supportive of the Chinese people that are protesting. We want their voices to be heard.And then any number of ways that we can make sure that we are getting that message out through their own communities.(CROSSTALK)KING: But here's one -- here is one of the real problems, though, the 21st century technology of repression, you can have widespread dissent in China, Russia, Iran, whether they can get out from under the thumb of despotic government that has pervasive surveillance, tapping phones, you name it, they're under total control.So, the real question to me is, no matter how serious the unrest is, can they ever throw off the yoke of these -- of these governments?BREAM: Well, and part of that brings up this question about U.S. companies like Apple and accusations that they're disabling some of the things that would allow iPhone users there in China to have communications about protest, about protecting themselves.What do we say to these U.S. companies that do such a large amount of business there?ERNST: Yeah. Let's not enable that to happen. Let's make sure that companies that are doing business in China can continue to do business in China. We want to make sure that they do have the opportunity to share word through their country.But obviously the Chinese, they are limiting the ability of individuals in China to communicate freely.BREAM: And it seems like in some cases, with the help of American companies. I know that's a growing concern.Let's talk about Ukraine, as well, because obviously that's another hot topic here. You will receive, I understand, a briefing on Wednesday that will update you on where we are. The president said he'd be willing to talk with Mr. Putin, that they would have to leave, Russia. Kremlin seems to say that's a no-go, they can't have that kind of conversation.How does this end?KING: Boy, if I had the answer to that, you know, I could accomplish all kinds of things.I think Putin is extremely dangerous right now. The ironic situation that we're in is that the better of the Ukrainians do, the more dangerous Putin becomes because he's running out of options. And what we're seeing now is actually his go-to option in Syria, in Grozny, where he's just bombing the hell out of the civilian population.And the problem is that that's just below the level where he knows we'll get into it in a more serious way. And so, we're in a very difficult situation. I think what we've supplied to Ukrainians has been enormously important. I think we need to continue to do so.Putin's number one priority right now is to divide the West in terms of our support for Ukraine. We can't fall for it.BREAM: So, the White House has now asked for $37 billion, $38 billion in this next tranche of potential spending.There are Republicans who are asking for more transparency. Over in the House side, especially, there's talk about of a resolution there that would allow for tracking these dollars, they are taxpayer dollars. U.S. citizens who worked hard for this money want to know exactly where it's going.Congressman Kat Cammack of Florida says this: I liken it to the airline videos they do before you take off. You need to put on your own oxygen mask before helping others. I just don't think as a legislator that I could, in good conscience, support billions and billions of funding going overseas when we have such dire needs here.Does she have a point?ERNST: We can do both, we truly can. And it is important that we as members of Congress are communicating why it is so important that we are enabling freedom in other countries, like Ukraine.I would put it this way: do we want to live in a world that is dominated by Russia, China, and Iran, where they are controlling the direction of our globe?I don't want to live in that world. I don't want to see what that looks like. I think it's incredibly important that we continue to advance freedom in Ukraine.KING: I think she has a point and it's wrong. I would suggest she'd Google Rhineland, 1936, Sudetenland, 1938. Hitler could have been stopped at those two times when he began his aggression in Eastern Europe. He wasn't, 55 million people died.Despots want to expand. Putin has told us who he is. Maya Angelou says, if someone tells you who you they are, you should believe them.He wants to reestablish the Soviet Empire. He said that. I have no doubt if he would have been able to sweep into Kyiv in a week, which is what he thought he could do, we'd now be talking about probes into the Baltic states or Poland.He's got to be stopped. It's in the national interest to stop him. The only thing more expensive than helping Ukraine is a world war.BREAM: Where do we draw the line financially?KING: Where do we draw the line?BREAM: Yeah.KING: Well, number one, accountability -- I have no problem with accountability. We should --BREAM: You support that kind of legislation?KING: Absolutely, and that's already happening, and there are a lot of inspector generals and all that kind of thing.I think the president has drawn the line in the right place, which is, intelligence support, equipment support, material support, no troops, unless there's an attack on a NATO ally.And the Ukrainians are showing great ability to defend themselves and it reminds me of Churchill, give us -- give us the arms and we'll take the fight. And that's what we're doing.BREAM: OK. Senators, thank you both very much for your time.ERNST: Thank you. Thank you.(END VIDEOTAPE)BREAM: Up next, my interview with former Vice President Mike Pence on the state of the Republican Party, his differences with President Trump and whether he'll cooperate into an investigation into his former boss when ""FOX News Sunday"" returns from the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BREAM: Back now in Simi Valley.It was Ronald Reagan who former Vice President Mike Pence says inspired him to leave the Democratic Party of his youth. In fact, on Inauguration Day in 2017, Pence took the oath of office on Ronald Reagan's bible. The 100-year- old had been taken over from the Library to the U.S. Capitol for the ceremony.Earlier this week, we sat down in Washington with the former vice president to discuss his thoughts on current state of the GOP and what his relationship is really like with his former boss.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BREAM: Mr. Vice President, welcome back to ""FOX News Sunday"".MIKE PENCE, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Shannon. Good to be here.BREAM: OK. So you are among those who had high hopes for the midterms. There were a lot of predictions about a red wave -- didn't materialize. The RNC is now doing sort of a postmortem, looking into what happened and what they call, quote, underperformance.What lessons do you take away, especially when it comes to independent voters, what can the Republican Party do moving forward?PENCE: Sure. You know, I've traveled to 35 states over last year and a half and campaigned for a lot of great men and women running for the House, the Senate and governorships.And there was one common denominator that I saw in the election results, and that was candidates that were focused on the future, candidates that were focused on the issues the American people are struggling with under the failed policies of the Biden administration, which are, you know crime in our streets, record inflation, gasoline prices through the roof, and, of course, the crisis at our southern border. Those candidates that focused on solutions and on the future actually did very well.But candidates who were focused on the past, particularly those who were focused on relitigating the last election, did not do as well and it convinces me, as I said when I was campaigning for Governor Brian Kemp in his primary, which in many ways divided along those lines, I said the Republican Party must be the party of the future and I think the midterm elections confirm that.We focus on the future, we'll do quite well, not just winning elections, but we'll win a balance future for the American people.BREAM: OK. So, let's -- you mentioned 2020, so let's go back and talk about some of that. In your new book, ""So help me God,"" you go into great detail about the events surrounding that, in the days and weeks afterwards.One of the lines that you had that really struck me is you said of Election Day: It had never occurred to me that we could lose the election.PENCE: Right.BREAM: Seems like a contrast to 2016, when nobody expected you to win and you did.Were you really that confident in 2020?PENCE: I have to tell you, I was. As I traveled around the country, even in the midst of COVID, I would come back to the White House and the president and I would always huddle and compare notes. And I told him that the enthusiasm was greater in 2020 than it even was in 2016.And at end of the day, while we lost that election in 2020, we still got 74 million votes, 10 million more votes than we had gotten four years earlier. And so, in many ways, it confirmed what I witnessed, but clearly, we face real challenges and real headwinds in that campaign.And I understood the frustration that people felt afterwards, the fact there were voting irregularities that took place in states around the country. Ultimately, there was no evidence of fraud to change the outcome in any of those states, but I think it set the table and set into motion what ultimately led to a tragic day on January 6.BREAM: You talk -- and I want to get to that -- but you talk about in the book how -- long before that, there were indications that the legal cases that were playing out weren't going to be enough, that you would come to the conclusion that there wouldn't be enough there.PENCE: Right.BREAM: You mention specific attorneys advising the president, some of the in-fighting among them. Why didn't you more publicly earlier say, I don't think there's a path here for us?PENCE: You know, the president and I worked very closely over the four and a half years we were together, in the campaign and then throughout the Trump-Pence administration.And I was always loyal to President Donald Trump. He was my president. He was my friend.And I thought it was important as vice president that I share my opinions with the president in private, as way of ensuring the strength of that relationship. And in shortly after election day 2020, I had told the president that he should be prepared if the legal challenges that we had every right to bring didn't play out, that he should simply be prepared to accept the outcome of the election, and if he wanted to run again and to run again. I told him that many times over the weeks that followed.And when a theory emerged shortly before Christmas that I had some unilateral ability to determine the outcome of the election, of what votes to count and what votes not to count, I really do believe that a along the way, I had hoped the president would come around.In fact, even just a few days, as I write in ""So Help Me God"", few days before January 6, the president was at a rally in Georgia in which he eluded to me at the top of the rally, he said, our great vice president has to come through for us, and then he said, if he doesn't, I won't like him as much.But then, Shannon, he caught himself and said, no, no. One thing you know about Mike is he always plays it straight.You know, I had hoped by counseling with the president and giving him my perspective on the state of play and the outcome of the election, my determination to do my duty under the Constitution on January 6, that he would come around. But sadly, that was not to be.BREAM: You had made very clear to him leading up to January 6, your position there, that you felt constitutionally, legally, you could not do anything to turn away those electoral votes on the floor of the House when you're presiding there. And yet the night before, a ""New York Times"" piece came out that talked about the fact that you were at odds with the president about that.The Trump campaign, in your book, you talk about -- put out a statement calling that fake news, saying you and the president were basically in lock step, you knew that wasn't true.How did you feel at that moment? And why didn't you say something then?PENCE: Well, I had told the president that I intended to do my duty under Constitution. I had no right to overturn the election and no vice president in American history had ever asserted that right.Shannon, the presidency belongs to the American people and the American people alone, and in fact, there's probably no idea more un-American than the notion that any one person could choose who the winner of a presidential election is. I had made that clear to the president for weeks leading up to that day.But frankly, at that point, when late at night on January 5th, I saw one more tweet go out, I simply thought it was important to state our case to the country and to the Congress the next day and that's precisely what we did.BREAM: So, leading up to that, the president wanted you to take action on the House floor to somehow turn away or make -- to appear illegitimate the electoral count votes. You were not going to do that and you had been vey clear to him.Here's a little bit of what he said to you. The president said to you: you're too honest. Hundreds of thousands are going to hate your guts. People are going to think you're stupid, and if you wimp out, you're just another somebody.So, what's your relationship like now? And how does that impact your considerations about potentially 2024 for yourself?PENCE: Look, the president and I clashed in the days leading up to January 6. I'll always believe that I did my duty that day by God's grace under the Constitution and upheld the peaceful transfer of power.But I was angry. I was angry about our difference that day and I was also angry at what I saw. You know, I was determined to stay at the Capitol, I wasn't going to leave my post. It was important that I remain and do everything in my power to work with Republican and Democrat leaders to reconvene the Congress, which because of the courage of law enforcement, Capitol Hill Police and federal law enforcement, the violence was quelled, we reconvened the Congress in the very same day and completed our work. We literally turned a day of tragedy into triumph for freedom.But in the aftermath of that, the president said the right things the next day. He committed to a peaceful transfer of power. He committed to an orderly transition and he condemned those that perpetrated violence at the Capitol building and we were back on track.But honestly, I thought of that Bible verse that says: Be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry. But that was easier said than done because I was angry.But five days later, the president asked if I would meet with him and I walked into that back room where he and I had spent so many hours together over four and a half years, four and a half years where we had rebuilt military, revived our economy, appointed conservatives to our federal courts, three Supreme Court justices, crushed the ISIS caliphate in the strength of armed forces, and made the world more peaceful and prosperous as a result.I walked into that back room and the president looked up at me and I sensed he was deeply remorseful about what had happened. He immediately asked about Karen and Charlotte who had been with me all day and all night on January 6th and 7th. He asked how they were, and I responded sternly. I said, ""They're fine, Mr. President"". I said, ""They wouldn't leave.""Then he said to me, ""Were you scared?"" And I said, ""No, I was angry. I was angry about our differences and I was infuriated at what I saw that day, people ransacking the Capitol, assaulting police officers."" That moment, he seemed genuinely remorseful.BREAM: I think he got what happened that day. Were you angry at protesters, or him or both for how that played out?PENCE: I would say both. I was angry at what the president had said when - - when a tweet came across while rioters were ransacking the Capitol, and the president actually tweeted an attack on me and my character, it was clear he decided to be a part of the problem.And I was determined to be a part of the solution and we worked the problem, and worked with leaders in both parties and quelled the violence.But I must tell you, in that time that he and I spent together, five days after January 6th, I was very candid with him. I made it clear to him that I believe I had done my duty that day. And the president lamented what had happened. He said, what if we hadn't had the rally. He said, it's so terrible to end like this.And I told him I was praying for him. And in that first meeting he didn't respond. But when we were together a few days later, before the end of the administration, we were talking through some details, wrapping up the work of the American people, and I reminded him again that I was praying for him. And he was dismissive about it at first. But then, at the end of our meeting, as I was walking out, I looked at him and I said, I guess there's two things we'll probably never agree on. And he looked up from that small table in that back room just off the Oval Office and said, what? And I said, I referred to our differences over my role on January 6th. And then I said, Mr. President, I'm never going to stop praying for you. And he looked up at me with a faint smile and said, that's right, don't ever change.(END VIDEO CLIP)BREAM: More from the interview when the former vice president when we return to the Reagan National Defense Forum. Does he plan to cooperate with the DOJ investigation into president Trump and will he make a run for the White House himself?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PENCE: I've been traveling this country over the last two years and we've gotten a lot of encouragement from people.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BREAM: Welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY here in Simi Valley, California.More now from our sit-down with former Vice President Pence. Has he been asked by the Justice Department to aid in the investigations into his former boss, and would he? Plus, what is their relationship like now?(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BREAM: Your critics say that the book, they give you credit for acting admirably they say on January 6th, but they say that what led up to January 6th, you had a part in. Here's part of what ""The New York Times"" says. You shouldn't get the glory for pulling democracy back from the brink if you helped carry it up there in the first place. And, so help me God, Pence did just that.So, what about the critique that you didn't break with the president when he said something offensive or controversial or untrue or when he broke with the kind of conservative principles that you are committed to?PENCE: Well, I - I will tell you that despite the differences that we had at the end, I will always be proud of the record of the Trump/Pence.BREAM: But what about the negatives?PENCE: And I'm not -BREAM: What about the things that got him into trouble and that - and stirred people up?PENCE: I'm not - I'm -- I'm never surprised by - I'm never surprised by criticism in ""The New York Times.""BREAM: No. No, you wouldn't be. No.PENCE: But - but, look, under - in our administration, we -- we endured a level of opposition by the Democrats and their allies in the media that was, in my judgement, unprecedented in my lifetime. And yet, in the midst of that --BREAM: But did the president not bring some of that on himself in his tweets, in his comments and things that really offended people?PENCE: Well, I don't - well, look, the -- the president and I have different styles in politics.BREAM: That's for sure.PENCE: He comes from a much more combative style of politics. I'm somebody that's always tried to put a high premium on civility in my public life as I write about in my book.BREAM: So why not call him out?PENCE: But I must tell you, as I write about in the book, literally on the day we were inaugurated in 2017, I recount how the president and I left the Oval Office during his first visits. And we were walking back the portico looking at the sight of the White House lit brightly against that dark night sky. But I noted that back on a stack of newspapers, just outside the Oval Office, was a copy of the January 20, 2017, ""Washington Post,"" the headline of which was, the quest to impeach Donald Trump begins today. And literally it never let up through two and a half years of a Russia hoax, through impeaching the president of the United States over a phone call, through Speaker Pelosi and Schumer's efforts to distort the 25th Amendment in the aftermath of that tragic day in January of 2021. All throughout there was an effort by the Democrats to in effect overturn our election in 2016 and drive the president from office.BREAM: OK, try to get to a little bit of lightning round so we can hit a number of issues.About January 6th, you've very detailed in the book. There are reports now that DOJ wants to talk to you potentially in connection with a potential criminal investigation or indictment of President Trump. Have they asked? Will you go?PENCE: You know, we've come to no resolution on that. And I'll be speaking to my council about that.BREAM: But there has been a formal request?PENCE: But I'll be -- there has been some contacts. But what I - what I will tell you is that we will make that decision on the basis of the unique responsibilities that I have under the Constitution of the United States as a former vice president. It's one of the reasons why I made it clear in recent weeks that the Congress has no right to my testimony before the January 6th committee.I was always concerned about the fact that a committee was formed where every member was appointed by the Democratic speaker of the House. That was inconsistent with the Congress and the structure that I experienced when I was in Congress. But while we didn't prevent any of our senior team from cooperating with the committee, I - I made it clear that as vice president I believe it would establish a terrible precedent to call a vice president before the Congress to testify about private deliberations with the president with whom they served. And I made it clear that we would not do that.But - but we'll - we'll evaluate the DOJ's request.BREAM: OK.One of the things in the Trump/Pence administration, I know that you all were very proud of, was the support of Israel. I was there in Jerusalem. We talked there when you all were moving the embassy. The Abraham Accords. There's been great support for Israel from the Trump/Pence administration and yet the president is now making a lot of headline for having a couple of people at Mar-a-Lago who've made anti-Semitic remarks. One of them is a Holocaust denier.Joel Rosenberg writes over at ""All Israel News"" this headline, Trump's terrible mistake, dining with two anti-Semites last week was an unmitigated disaster and tarnishes his otherwise stellar record as being pro-Israel and pro-Jewish. The president's made some statement about not knowing exactly who Nick Fuentes was or others there. Is that in itself disqualifying, this whole episode -- Bibi Netanyahu has called him out - for somebody who is running to be the president again of this country?PENCE: Well, I think that's a question for the American people. Anti- Semitism is real and it's rising in many parts of the world.You know, as I write in my bonk, I had the privilege of co-founded the Anti-Semitism Caucus on Capitol Hill with the late Tom Lantos, who was the only Holocaust survivor ever to serve in the Congress of the United States. And I think it's important for those who us who have had the opportunity to serve our country, or aspire to serve our country in high national office, to make it clear that there is no place in the American political debate for white nationalism, for Holocaust deniers or for anti-Semitism. I think I made it clear the president was wrong to give the anti-Semites a seat at the table. It was wrong for President Barack Obama to associate with Louis Farrakhan. I think now, more than ever, we need to make it clear that we reject anti-Semitism, left, right and center. Leaders in this country deserve to speak those words to the American people.BREAM: This book feels very much sort of like your opening argument to the American people, about having a conversation with them about whether you may be the right person to become president of this country.Where are you in that conversation with Karen, with your trusted advisors? When would you make a decision? And what would make you feel compelled to get in, especially knowing your former boss is in?PENCE: Well, with - with you at the Reagan Library, Shannon, I can tell you, Ronald Reagan said one time, the American people have a funny way of letting you know if they want you to run for president. And I've been traveling this country over the last two years. And we've gotten a lot of encouragement from people.I truly do believe that the American people want to get back to the policies of the Trump/Pence administration, of less taxes, less regulation, more American energy, secure borders, a strong military, standing tall in the world, standing with our allies, standing up to our enemies. They want to have - they want to have judges on our courts who will defend our liberties at a time when many of our liberties are under assault every day.But I also hear from people that - that they long for leadership that could unite our country around our highest ideals, including civility and respect. You know, I - I believe that democracy depends on heavy doses of civility. And what Karen and I will try and give prayerful consideration to over the holidays, when all of our kids are home for the first time in three years, with two in the military, is whether we - whether we can play a role in that, in giving the American people a fresh start, back to conservative principles that were working, but maybe also lead us in a direction where - where we could have government that is as good to one another as the American people are to each other each and every day.BREAM: Any scenario in which there would be a Pence/Trump ticket?PENCE: Well -BREAM: Anything can happen in politics?PENCE: Almost anything can happen. But I will tell you, we'll -- we'll sort out what our - what our role, what our calling is. But you know me well enough to know, we're going to - we're going to pray all the way through it and we'll go where we're called.BREAM: Mr. Vice President, thank you very much for joining us.PENCE: Thank you, Shannon.(END VIDEOTAPE)BREAM: Up next from the Reagan Library, a Christian web designer, opposed to same-sex marriage, is at the center of a free speech case about to go to the U.S. Supreme Court. We'll bring in our Sunday group on what a ruling could mean for protecting your right to free speech.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BREAM: Welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY, live from the Reagan Library.Democrats are a step closer to dramatically overhauling the presidential nominating contest, making South Carolina first.Time now for our Sunday group here in Simi Valley. Former Bush White House adviser Karl Rove, and Fox News chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin.Great to have you both with us in person today.JENNIFER GRIFFIN, FOX NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Thank you.BREAM: OK, let's start with this calendar change. ""The New Republic"" puts it this way, by frontloading the 2024 presidential contest in southern states, the president's proposal would cement the Democrats as the center left party and make it harder for future insurgents.Karl, a lot of folks think this is specifically crafted for a Biden run.KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, absolutely. This is a clear indication that he wants to run for re-election. The old calendar started in Iowa, which gave him a fourth place finish and was followed by New Hampshire that gave him a fifth place finish and he wants to move South Carolina that gave him a first class finish to the front of the line. So it's going to be interesting to watch.There are problems, though. This is a notional effort. Changes in state law are required. He's going to have to deal with a Republican legislature and governor in Georgia and in South Carolina and a Democrat legislature and a Republican governor in Nevada to make these changes all come about.And there's one state that he's not going to be able to deal with. New Hampshire has in its state law a provision that it gets to be the first in the country and automatically the secretary of state can move the primary date to a week before any other state that wants to be first. And both Democrats and Republicans in New Hampshire are going to try and guard that jealously.BREAM: Yes, it's a proposal at this point. OK, so the backdrop here, obviously, is the Reagan Defense Forum. So, Jen, let's talk about that.China getting a lot of the headlines. ""Bloomberg"" puts it this way, Biden needs a Reagan-esque approach to China, says the upheaval there could be to America's strategic advantage if President Joe Biden can navigate the dilemmas of dealing with a powerful but repressive regime. That's one of the top topics there.GRIFFIN: Well, I think what's really interesting is, President Xi has been really taken aback both the fact that President - President Putin has had such a hard time in Ukraine, that has -- his silent approach, he's not supporting him with weapons. But then look at the domestic troubles that he has. These Covid protests. These protests where people are saying, enough already. That -- those domestic protests -- for the first time you've heard people call for President Xi to step down. That has never happened in China.But the - the -- the anti-vaccine movement there, it's really his own making. It was vaccine nationalism. He didn't want to bring in the mRNA foreign made vaccines and now he has an unvaccinated population. They're vaccine hesitant. And now he's having to lock them in their homes and drag them out to quarantine. The -- the pictures are not good and he's going to be facing more of this in the future.BREAM: Karl, Iran, Russia, Ukraine, everything else on the table here, too.ROVE: Yes, it was a very interesting discussion. It was -- one of the - one of the thing I walked away from was the unanimity between Republican and Democrat legislatures who were here, members of Congress who were here, broadly on both Ukraine and China. There is a bipartisan consensus that Ukraine must be supported and that China must be confronted. And I -- I was really taken aback by the strength of the conviction from Democrats and Republicans alike.BREAM: Want to quickly touch on another domestic issue.The Supreme Court, tomorrow, will hear a case about a web designer in Colorado. She's a Christian. The state law there says if she's going to design websites for same-sex -- or for traditional weddings, that she has to do it for same-sex and other weddings that would come to her. She says it's a free speech violation to make her make those websites.Jen, the - the - you know, over in Congress, they just voted this week to codify and try to protect same-sex marriage nationally. Now you have this collision of rights. How does this get figured out?GRIFFIN: Well, what's interesting is, this is different from the last case that was brought about the wedding cake. That was about free exercise. This is going to be about free speech. And she's arguing that it's -- her speech is being compelled, that she's going to have to make the -- design a website, that she's an artist, and that she's being compelled to do something she doesn't want to do. That's the argument.I think it's notable, and you mentioned the -- what the Senate has done about same-sex marriage. If you look at Gallup polls from 1996, 27 percent of the country supported same-sex marriage. Now it's up to 71 percent. So this is going to be another test for the court. It's going to get political. It's going to affect people's view of the court.BREAM: And, Karl, it's about finding that balance. How do you find it?ROVE: It is a balance and it's going to be a test to the original decision of the Supreme Court. Writing for the court in - in that decision, Justice Kennedy said, it must be emphasized that religions and those who adhere to religious doctrines may continue to advocate with upmost sincere conviction that by divine precept same-sex marriage should not be condoned. And this web designer is being asked to violate her deeply held, sincere conviction that same-sex marriage should not be condoned by having her take an act that condones it.And I saw a journalist who said, you know - who was gay and married and said, this treats me as a second-class citizen. Well, it also treats her as a second-class citizen whose religious convictions should not be honored. And it's going to be difficult for the court to resolve this. And it's going to be important for the country to accept whatever the resolution is.BREAM: We'll watch for that.And I also want to touch on the World Cup.Jen, there have been real ramification for what happened with some of the Iranian players, demonstrations. There is a real-world impact to what happened there.GRIFFIN: Well, that's the backdrop of what's happening here at the World Cup and the protests in Iran. That USA/Iran game, you know, gave me chills. We've just learned that the female rock climber, Elnaz Rekabi, who was -- took off her hijab and climbed in South Korea, when she came home, we just learned they destroyed -- that the regime destroyed her home -- it's now rubble -- when she came back.We have just learned that there was that picture of Saeid Ezatolahi, who was the Iranian player on the ground, and Brenden Aaronson, the U.S. player, consoling him after the game, knowing what he was returning home to, and his friend, Mehran Samak, 27, was shot in the head after he celebrated the loss of Iran as a protest against the regime. These protests are not going away.BREAM: They're not.All right, panel, thank you very much. We'll see you next Sunday.When we return from the Reagan Library, a look at what the leading Republican voices of today have to say about the future of their party, and they don't all agree.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BREAM: When Ronald Reagan gave his now iconic ""time for choosing"" speech, he made the case for small government conservatism. In turn making himself the new party star. Now the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute is hosting today's Republican stars from across the spectrum to hash out their debates about where the party should go next.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)RONALD REAGAN, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: You and I have a rendezvous with destiny.BREAM: It is the speech that would set a decades long chorus for American conservatism.REAGAN: Whether we believe in our capacity for self-government or whether we abandon the American revolution and confess that a little intellectual elite, in a far distant capital, can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them ourselves.BREAM: That premise is at the heart of the Reagan Library's Time for Choosing Speaker Series, which asks the nation's most prominent conservatives where they believe the party should go.SEN. TIM SCOTT (R-SC): Our fight is not merely about 2022 and 2024, but it's about our future as a country and therefore the future of the world.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Please welcome Ambassador Nikki Haley.BREAM: Many shared how their personal stories illustrate American ideals.NIKKI HALEY, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N.: As a brown girl growing up in a small southern town, I saw the promise of America unfold before me.BREAM: Others talked about the people they feel the party must champion.SEN. TOM COTTON (R-AR): The Republican Party has assumed the mantel of this proud, patriotic and populist tradition. We are the party of the common man, the worker, the farmer, the cop on the beatBREAM: And much of the focus has been on the currents state of the party, hinting at its recent leadership.CHRIS CHRISTIE (R), FORMER NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR: We are also so long and overdue to stop wallowing in the past. We need to be the party that embraces the truth. The truth. Even when it is painful and unacceptable.BREAM: Outgoing Congresswoman Liz Cheney called out that wing of the party by name.REP. LIZ CHENEY (R-WY): We have to choose, because Republicans cannot both be loyal to Donald Trump and loyal to the Constitution. At this moment -BREAM: Even she appeared surprised at the crowd's response.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And God bless America.BREAM: The events are hosted by the man who has done perhaps the most to preserve Ronald and Nancy Reagan legacy, John Heubusch. Nancy Reagan personally chose him to lead her husband's foundation.BREAM (on camera): What was the genesis of this idea for the speaker series Time for Choosing?JOHN HEUBUSCH, REAGAN LIBRARY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR: We are in a spot where we have to have really a new time for choosing, so it just fit perfectly.BREAM: How important is that, that the party have those difficult, internal, maybe sometimes heated conversations about where they go from here?HEUBUSCH: The party is not going to be able to move forward and succeed with it drifting apart as it is. And, unfortunately, I think it's going to take a lot of commotion in the next two years to settle this out. But settle it out we must if we're to be chosen by the American people to lead the nation.REAGAN: Tear down this wall.BREAM (voice over): Like Reagan, many of those invited spoke of strength, in confronting challenges abroad.MIKE POMPEO, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: If America is not strong, the world will be at the mercy of tyrants and enter an era we dare not imagine.BREAM: But it is the strength of the party's commitments to its domestic principles that were the focus of some of the most poignant remarks.MIKE PENCE, FORMER U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: The American people must know that our Republican Party will always keep our oath to the Constitution, even when it would be politically expedient to do otherwise.(END VIDEOTAPE)BREAM: Many of you may remember John from our interview with him last year. At the time he told us he was stepping down after years of leading the Reagan Foundation. But, lucky for us, he's still in charge as the search continues for his successor.That is it for us today. Thank you for joining us. I'm Shannon Bream. Have a great week and we'll see you next FOX NEWS SUNDAY.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2022 Fox News Network, LLC.

In a 10-1 ruling, the court said Aryeh Deri's appointment as a minister in the new coalition government was ""extremely unreasonable.""Deri is leader of the Shas party, a religious party mostly made up of Sephardic Jews. Shas has the second-most seats in Netanyahu's coalition government with 11, and if they were to leave the government, Israelis would likely have to go back to the polls.Deri is currently serving as the minister of health and interior affairs and will later split his term and become the all-powerful finance minister in the second half of the Netanyahu government. He also serves as a deputy prime minister.BENJAMIN NETANYAHU RETURNS TO POWER IN ISRAEL AS NEW GOVERNMENT IS SWORN IN   Benjamin Netanyahu, left, and Aryeh Deri (Hillel Maeir / TPS / File)In 2000, Deri served 22 months in prison for taking bribes. In January 2022, he resigned from the Israeli Parliament following a plea deal on different fraud charges. The deal was criticized by many in the Israeli public, claiming it let Deri off too easily and paved the way for his swift comeback to politics despite the alleged crimes and his pledge to retire from politics.It is now up to Netanyahu to decide if to honor the court ruling and remove him from office or keep his appointment.Two weeks ago, in his response to the petitions filed against Deri serving, Netanyahu said that ""there is no way to bring about governmental stability without his appointment,"" calling Deri ""an anchor of experience, wisdom and responsibility."" Netanyahu reportedly visited Deri Wednesday afternoon to discuss the matter.Deri's party released a statement accusing the court of negating Shas' 400,000 voters: ""Today, the court effectively ruled that elections are meaningless. The court's decision is political and tainted with extreme unreasonability.""Netanyahu's coalition parties issued a joint statement shortly after the verdict, calling it ""shocking and painful.""BIDEN ADMIN COMMITTED TO 'TWO-STATE SOLUTION' FOLLOWING NETANYAHU APPOINTMENT  Israel's supreme court in Jerusalem.

We have said there is no reason for Aryeh Deri not to serve as a senior minister in Israel.""The ruling might jeopardize Netanyahu's new coalition as it has shrunk the timeline of Israel's impending constitutional crisis and potentially thrown his coalition into chaos. Some of his coalition partners have already called him to ignore the ruling.

The document completely ignores our people’s historical affinity to our homeland, completely ignores the political agreements and the status of the State of Israel in Area C and seeks to establish the 1949 borders as Israel’s final-status permanent borders – in complete disregard of the Jewish communities in the area.""Area C is located in the disputed West Bank territory, referred to by many Israelis by the region’s biblical names as Judea and Samaria. Close to 500,000 Israelis and around 300,000 Palestinians live in Area C, which makes up 60% of the total area of Judea and Samaria.Palestinians want Area C as part of an independent state, while a number of Israeli parties want the territory to be absorbed into Israel proper. The EU leaked document surfaced ahead of Benjamin Netanyahu's efforts to form a new right-wing government.

It is now reported that the U.N. Security Council will meet later this week in New York to discuss the visit.The area is also the third most important site in Islam, the Al-Aqsa Mosque, which is also located on the Temple Mount—the Jewish name for the compound—in the Old City of Jerusalem. The Temple Mount is where both temples stood in Jerusalem before they were destroyed by invading armies.Israel’s new right-of-center coalition government entered office last week. Since Israel captured the Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem during the 1967 Six-Day War, Israeli governments have permitted the Jordanian religious institution, the Waqf, to manage the Temple Mount and Al-Aqsa Mosque. Jews and Christians are largely not permitted to pray on the Temple Mount, and there are severe restrictions for non-Muslim visitors to enter the compound. The controversial firebrand Ben-Gvir tweeted a picture of himself on the Temple Mount with security officials, writing, ""The Israeli government of which I am a member will not surrender to a vile organization of murderers. The Temple Mount is open to all and if Hamas thinks that if it threatens me, that will deter me, they had better understand that times have changed. There is a government in Jerusalem.""   The Temple Mount and the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. (iStock)BENJAMIN NETANYAHU RETURNS TO POWER IN ISRAEL AS NEW GOVERNMENT IS SWORN IN Israel has declared all of Jerusalem its indivisible capital. Palestinians want East Jerusalem, where the Temple Mount is situated, as their capital of an independent a state along with the absorption of the disputed West Bank territory. The Temple Mount is the most significant holy site for Jews because two ancient temples were located on the compound and later destroyed. The Babylonians destroyed the First Temple in 586 B.C., and the Romans annihilated the Second Temple in year 70.  A section of the Second Temple—the Western Wall—is still standing.According to Jewish tradition, the 3,000-year-old Temple Mount is the location where God collected dust to create Adam—the first human being. The Temple Mount is also holy for Jews because it is the location where Abraham almost sacrificed his son Isaac to affirm his faith. The Jewish King Solomon built the First Temple of the Jews at the site. Muslims also term the Temple Mount the Haram al-Sharif, the Noble Sanctuary, where the Al-Aqsa Mosque and Dome of the Rock are located. The founder of Islam, Prophet Muhammed is, according to tradition, said to have ascended to heaven from the Noble Sanctuary.  Muslim worshipers fill the grounds outside the Al-Aqsa mosque on the last Friday of Ramadan, Dec. 31. About 400,000 Muslims packed Islam's thrid holiest shrine during this holy month of fasting and prayer. (Reuters)For Christians, the site is very significant as it was where Jesus would have been as a young boy, where he attended festivals, and he is also said to have taught there. Additionally, it's believed that Jesus foretold the destruction of the temple while there.   Rev. Dr. Petra Heltd, a leading Christian scholar, told Fox News Digital that ""The significance of the Temple Mount cannot be overstated in the Christian world.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.An Israeli lawmaker is planning to introduce legislation to annex the Jordan Valley, an eastern strip of the West Bank that is home to roughly 30 Jewish settlements.Knesset Member Amb. Danny Danon is looking to propose the bill, which would make the area, which runs along the Jordan River from the Sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea, part of Israel proper. The region is part of what is known as Area C of the West Bank, which means it is already under Israeli control, but its residents live under Israeli military law. As it is not currently an official part of Israel, Israeli criminal law and some civil laws have only applied to its residents under an emergency measure that had to be renewed every five years since Israel took control of the West Bank in 1967. That measure expired in June 2022 but was eventually renewed on Tuesday. Danon’s bill would make it so that this would no longer have to be done.""All aspects of the sovereignty of the State of Israel will apply to all areas of Israeli settlements in the Jordan Valley, including the industrial areas that serve them, the archaeological sites in the area and the access roads to these areas,"" says a draft of the bill obtained by Fox News Digital.‘PAY TO SLAY’: BIDEN SUED FOR SENDING HALF A BILLION IN PALESTINIAN AID THAT COULD FUND ACTS OF TERRORISM  Danny Danon speaks to journalists on the Downing of the Syrian Airplane at the UN Headquarters in New York City, New York, July 24, 2018. (Photo by EuropaNewswire/Gado/Getty Images) (EuropaNewswire/Gado/Getty Images)The bill applies to the areas covered by the Jordan Valley Regional Council (which includes 22 settlements), the Dead Sea Scrolls Regional Council (seven settlements), and the Ma'ale Ephraim Local Council (one settlement), as well as ten communities located near the valley. Those communities are Kochav HaShahar, Rimonim, Ma'ale Machmesh, Mitzpe Hagit, Neve Erez, Nofei Prat, Anatot, Kfar Adumim, Mitzpe Jericho, and Migdalim.""The Jordan Valley is of great importance to the State of Israel - historically, security-wise and economically,"" an explanatory note for the bill says, noting that its location -- situated between Jordan and Palestinian-controlled areas of the West Bank – make it ""Israel's eastern security belt."" Its annexation was first proposed in a plan the by then-Minister of Labor Yigal Alon after the 1967 Six Day War during which Israel took control of the West Bank. ISRAELI AMBASSADOR SLAMS UN FOR MEETING OVER VISIT TO TEMPLE MOUNT  A view shows the Jordan Valley in the West Bank February 11, 2020. (REUTERS/Ammar Awad) (Reuters)The bill is sure to anger the Palestinians and their leadership, as an annexation under the bill would be a unilateral move taken without any existing agreement between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Fox News reached out to Danon's office regarding this, but he was not available at the time.The official designation of the West Bank territories of Judea and Samaria as being parts of Areas A, B, and C – each with its own level of Israeli or Palestinian control – came about from 1995's Oslo II Accords, which at the time was meant as a temporary measure until a final two-state agreement could be reached.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a surprise trip to Jordan on Tuesday to meet with King Abdullah II for the first time in over four years, seeking to shore up ties that have strained since he took office at the helm of Israel's most right-wing government in history.The rare meeting between the leaders, who have long had a rocky relationship, comes as tensions grow over Israel’s new ultranationalist government, which took office late last year. The talks centered around the status of a contested holy site in the Old City of Jerusalem sacred to both Jews and Muslims, an emotional issue at the heart of the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, Jordan's official statement indicated.Jordan's royal court said the king urged Israel to respect the status quo at the sacred compound, which Muslims call the Noble Sanctuary and Jews call the Temple Mount. The compound — the third-holiest site in Islam — sits on a sprawling plateau also home to the iconic golden Dome of the Rock.ISRAEL, JORDAN SIGN DECLARATION OF INTENT AT UN CLIMATE CONFERENCE TO CONSERVE, PROTECT JORDAN RIVERUnder an arrangement that has prevailed for decades under Jordan's custodianship, Jews and non-Muslims are permitted visits during certain hours but may not pray there. But Jewish religious nationalists, including members of Israel's new governing coalition, have increasingly visited the site and demanded equal prayer rights for Jews there, infuriating the Palestinians and Muslims around the world.In Tuesday's meeting, King Abdullah II also pushed Israel to ""stop its acts of violence"" that are undermining hopes for an eventual peaceful settlement to the decadeslong Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the Jordanian government added, reaffirming its support for a two-state solution. Israel's new coalition has vowed to expand Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and even annex the territory, making a future independent Palestinian state unviable.

Netanyahu made a surprise trip to Jordan to meet with King Abdullah II on Jan 24, 2023. (Abir Sultan/Pool Photo via AP)Netanyahu’s office said he discussed ""regional issues"" and security and economic cooperation with Jordan, a key regional ally. Jordan’s 1994 treaty normalizing ties with Israel produced a chilly-at-best peace between the former enemies.The Jordanian government has already summoned the Israeli ambassador to Amman twice in the last month since Israel's new government took office — both times after an incident at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound. Netanyahu has repeatedly offered assurances that there has been no change in the status quo at the site.ISRAEL URGES CITIZENS TO 'DOWNPLAY' THEIR ISRAELI IDENTITY AT QATAR WORLD CUP FOR THEIR OWN 'SECURITY'Earlier this month, Israel’s new hard-line minister of national security, Itamar Ben-Gvir, made a provocative visit to the site, drawing condemnations from Jordan and across the Arab world. Jordan also protested to Israel after Israeli police briefly blocked the Jordanian ambassador from entering the Al-Aqsa Mosque, decrying the move as an affront to Jordan's role as custodian.The compound is administered by Jordanian religious authorities as part of an unofficial agreement after Israel captured east Jerusalem, along with the West Bank and Gaza, in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel is in charge of security at the site. Because of Jordan’s special role and the site’s importance to Muslims around the world, whatever happens at the site has regional implications.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe site emerged as a major flashpoint between Israel and the Muslim world in 2017, when Israel placed metal detectors, cameras and other security measures at entrances to the compound in response to a deadly Palestinian attack there. After days of some of the worst Israeli-Palestinian clashes in years, Jordan helped resolve the crisis.Over the years, the neighbors have maintained a crucial security alliance, buttressing Jordan’s position as a partner of the West in one of the world’s most volatile regions.

(Courtesy: IDF Spokesman's Unit via CENTCOM.)The American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) and U.S.-based Jewish groups have done the ""bidding"" of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and used their ""power and influence"" to stop successive administrations from adopting tougher policies toward Israel, according to New York Times columnist Tom Friedman. ""The people I'm most angry with and have written about is [sic] AIPAC and the American Jewish organizations who have done Bibi's bidding over the years,"" Friedman said in an online discussion last month with fellow writer Peter Beinart, using Netanyahu's popular nickname. ""If the reason the administrations are where they are right now, Peter, is because people like the American Jewish Committee and AIPAC at every turn used their power and influence to still the hand of any administration wanting to have a more serious and energetic and vigorous policy.""""And for that,"" Friedman continued, ""They will have to answer to history.""Friedman's comments came in response to a question from Beinart, who claimed Netanyahu is a ""racist"" who doesn't believe ""Palestinians are really human.""

In Israel, the world's lone Jewish state, Arabs comprise about 21% of the population, serve in the Israeli government, and have the same legal rights as other Israeli citizens. In the Palestinian territories, it's illegal to sell land to Jews or Israelis, with punishments ranging from hard labor to prison to execution.Friedman went on to quote a past column of his arguing Netanyahu was able to address Congress in the past because he was ""bought and paid for by AIPAC."" The exact wording of the 2011 article was that the standing ovation the prime minister got in Congress was ""bought and paid for by the Israel lobby"" — a statement for which he received significant backlash.Friedman's remarks seem to echo those of Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), who in 2019 came under fire for accusing American politicians of supporting the Jewish state because of the ""Benjamins,"" a slang term for money. When asked who's paying U.S. leaders to be pro-Israel, she responded, ""AIPAC."" Omar later apologized but still called AIPAC ""problematic."" She then praised a Democratic activist while retweeting a thread in which he said AIPAC's lobbying is ""about the Benjamins.""The New York Times writer then said that if Netanyahu ""wanted to speak tomorrow"" at the University of Wisconsin, ""they'd have to bring out the National Guard,"" arguing the prime minister couldn't address the campus due to large-scale opposition.""Shame on him,"" added Friedman.

University officials called the graffiti antisemitic.Friedman and the American Jewish Committee did not respond to Fox News Digital's requests for comment. However, AIPAC provided a statement.""Across many different governments and administrations in both countries, we have consistently worked to strengthen the U.S.-Israel relationship, which is entirely aligned with American values and interests,"" an AIPAC spokesperson told Fox News Digital. ""As Israel confronts threats from an Iranian regime that has accelerated its efforts to obtain a nuclear weapon and bolstered its alliance with Russia, we will continue our efforts to help ensure the Jewish state has the resources to defend itself.""Friedman's comments weren't the first time that the New York Times has appeared critical of Israel and Netanyahu. In 2019, for example, the Times' international edition published a cartoon of a guide dog with a big nose and the face of Netanyahu leading a blind Donald Trump wearing a yarmulke. The dog had a Star of David hanging from its collar.

The statement, however, made no mention of the thousands of additional settlement homes in existing settlements officials say are to be soon approved.A contentious U.N. Security Council resolution pushed by the Palestinians and their supporters slated for Monday would have condemned Israel for settlement expansion and demanded a halt to future activity.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.Two ultranationalist Israeli Cabinet ministers on Tuesday defiantly dismissed a growing chorus of global condemnation of new Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank, instead promising to double down and legalize dozens of wildcat outposts in the occupied territory.Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir reaffirmed their commitment to expand Israeli authority in the lands that the Palestinians seek for a future state. Their comments came after the United States expressed opposition to the move and as four European countries added their criticism.Smotrich, a religious settler, said he and his allies in the government — the most right-wing in Israel's history — remain ""committed to removing completely the restrictions on building in Judea and Samaria,"" referring to the West Bank by its biblical names.BIDEN ADMIN CRITICIZES REPORTED ISRAELI SETTLEMENT EXPANSION IN WEST BANK""Disagreements are allowed, even between friends,"" he added.Ben-Gvir, who also lives in a Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank, urged the U.S. and Europe to ""stop being worried.""""The Land of Israel belongs to the people of Israel,"" he said emphatically. ""Nine settlements is nice. But it’s still not enough. We want many more.""  Two Israeli Cabinet members issued a rebuttal to American criticism of settlement construction in the West Bank.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.The U.N. Security Council unanimously approved a watered-down statement strongly opposing Israel’s continued construction and expansion of settlements Monday. The vote came after high-stakes negotiations by the Biden administration succeeded in derailing a legally binding resolution that would have demanded a halt to Israeli settlement activity.The Palestinian-backed draft resolution was the subject of frantic talks by senior Biden administration officials including Secretary of States Antony Blinken with Palestinian, Israeli and United Arab Emirates leaders. Those discussions culminated in a deal Sunday to forego it in favor of a weaker presidential statement that is not legally binding, according to multiple diplomats familiar with the situation.The deal averted a potential diplomatic crisis, with the U.S. almost certainly vetoing the resolution, which would have angered Palestinian supporters at a time when the U.S. and its Western allies are trying to gain international support against Russia for its war with Ukraine. The war marks its one-year anniversary of President Vladimir Putin’s invasion this week.ISRAEL PROMISES BIDEN ADMINISTRATION NO NEW OUTPOSTS IN WEST BANKBut U.S. support for the presidential statement angered Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.His office issued a blistering statement saying the Security Council statement ""negates the rights of Jews to live in their historical homeland, ignores Palestinian terror attacks in Jerusalem in which 10 Israeli citizens were murdered this month, turns a blind eye to the fact that the Palestinian Authority subsidizes terror and pays the families of terrorists, and diminishes the antisemitism that led to the murder of millions of Jews.""In an unusual criticism of Israel’s closest ally, the U.S., Netanyahu’s statement said: ""The declaration didn’t need to be said and the United States didn’t need to join it.""By contrast, Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian U.N. ambassador, welcomed the presidential statement telling reporters: ""We are very happy that there was a very strong united message from the Security Council against the illegal, unilateral measure"" announced by Israel on Feb. 12 to construct 10,000 new housing units and legalize nine new outposts in the West Bank.He also cited the council statement that Israeli settlement activities ""are dangerously imperiling the viability of the two-state solution."" It envisions Israel and Palestine living side-by-side in peace based on borders before the 1967 Mideast war.Mansour said 14 of the 15 council members supported the resolution, but one member — a clear reference to the United States — didn’t want to use its veto. ""I think the fact that we reached a unanimous agreement on a presidential statement is a very important step in the right direction,"" he said.To avoid a vote on the draft resolution, the diplomats said, the U.S. managed to convince both Israel and the Palestinians to agree in principle to a six-month freeze in any unilateral action they might take.  The United Nations issued a statement condeming the Israeli government's allowance of settlement construction in the disputed West Bank territory. (AP Photo/Mahmoud Illean)On the Israeli side, that would mean a commitment to not expanding settlements until at least August, according to the diplomats. On Monday, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would not greenlight any new wildcat settlements in the West Bank beyond nine outposts that it approved retroactively earlier this month.On the Palestinian side, the diplomats said it would mean a commitment until August not to pursue action against Israel at the U.N. and other international bodies such as the World Court, the International Criminal Court and the U.N. Human Rights Council. But Mansour said the U.N. General Assembly’s request to the U.N.’s highest judicial body, the International Court of Justice also known as the World Court for an advisory opinion on the legality of Israeli politcies in the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem is going ahead.The Palestinian push for a resolution came after Israel’s new right-wing government reaffirmed its commitment to construct new settlements in the West Bank and expand its authority on land the Palestinians seek for a future state.Israel captured the West Bank, along with east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, in the 1967 Mideast war. The United Nations and most of the international community consider Israeli settlements illegal and an obstacle to ending the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Some 700,000 Israeli settlers live in the West Bank and Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem.The presidential statement does not condemn Israeli settlement activity or demand a halt. It does condemn ""all acts of violence against civilians, including acts of terrorism.""On settlements, the Security Council statement also ""strongly opposes all unilateral measures that impede peace including … Israeli construction and expansion of settlements, confiscation of Palestinians’ land, and the `legalization’ of settlement outposts, demolition of Palestinians’ homes and displacement of Palestinian civilians.""UAE Ambassador Lana Nusseibeh, the council’s Arab representative who sponsored the resolution, commended the U.S. role and said the statement is ""the first output from the Security Council in six years on the situation in Palestine.""ISRAELI OFFICIALS DOUBLE DOWN ON SETTLEMENT CONSTRUCTION, REBUKE US CRITICISMIn December 2016, the Security Council demanded that Israel ""immediately and completely cease all settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem."" It stressed that halting settlement activities ""is essential for salvaging the two-state solution.""That resolution was adopted after President Barack Obama’s administration abstained in the vote, a reversal of the United States’ longstanding practice of protecting its close ally Israel from action at the United Nations, including by vetoing Arab-supported resolutions.The presidential statement was read at the start of the council’s monthly Mideast meeting by its president, Malta’s U.N. Ambassador Vanessa Frazier.U.N. Mideast envoy Tor Wennesland then warned the council that ""we are witnessing"" a surge in violence ""including some of the deadliest incidents in nearly 20 years,"" expressing concern that the negative trajectory is ""gaining in both pace and intensity.""

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government on Tuesday for the first time advanced a plan to overhaul the country’s legal system, defying a mass uproar among Israelis and calls for restraint from the United States.The vote marked only preliminary approval for the plan. But it raised the stakes in a political battle that drew tens of thousands of protesters into the streets, sparked criticism from influential sectors of society and widened the rifts in an already polarized country.The 63-47 vote after midnight gave initial approval to a plan that would give Netanyahu’s coalition more power over who becomes a judge. It is part of a broader package of changes that seeks to weaken the country’s Supreme Court and transfer more power to the ruling coalition.ISRAELI PROTESTERS TAKE TO STREETS TO BLAST NETANYAHU 'JUDICIAL REFORMS' AS PM CALLS FOR UNITYNetanyahu’s ultrareligious and ultranationalist allies say these changes are needed to rein in the powers of an unelected judiciary. Critics fear that judges will be appointed based on their loyalty to the government or prime minister — and say that Netanyahu, who faces trial on corruption charges, has a conflict of interest in the legislation.The showdown has plunged Israel into one of its most bitter domestic crises, with both sides insisting that the future of democracy is at stake in their Middle Eastern country. Israeli Palestinians, a minority that may have the most to lose by the overhaul, have mostly stayed on the sidelines, due to discrimination they face at home and Israel’s ongoing 55-year occupation of their Palestinian brethren in the West Bank.The legislators cast their votes after a vitrolic debate that dragged on past midnight. During the session, opposition lawmakers chanted, ""shame,"" and wrapped themselves in the Israeli flag — and some were ejected from the hall.Thousands were rallying outside the Knesset, waving Israeli flags and holding signs reading ""saving democracy!"" Earlier in the day, protesters launched a sit-down demonstration at the entrance of the homes of some coalition lawmakers and briefly halted traffic on Tel Aviv’s main highway.Netanyahu accused the demonstrators of violence and said they were ignoring the will of the people who voted his coalition into power last November.""The people exercised their right to vote in the elections and the people’s representatives will exercise their right to vote here in Israel’s Knesset. It’s called democracy,"" Netanyahu said, though he left the door open for dialogue on the planned changes.  Despite protests, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government is pushing forward with a judicial overhaul. (AP Photo/Ohad Zwigenberg)The vote on part of the legislation is just the first of three readings required for parliamentary approval, a process that is expected to take months.Nonetheless, the opposition, including tens of thousands of protesters in front of the Knesset in Jerusalem and in Tel Aviv, saw Monday’s vote as the coalition’s determination to barrel ahead.""We are fighting for our children’s future, for our country’s future. We don’t intend to give up,"" said opposition leader Yair Lapid.Israel’s figurehead president has urged the government to freeze the legislation and seek a compromise with the opposition, a position supported by most polls.Leaders in the booming tech sector have warned that weakening the judiciary could drive away investors.The overhaul has prompted otherwise stoic former security chiefs to speak out, and even warn of civil war. The plan has even sparked rare warnings from the U.S., Israel’s chief international ally.U.S. Ambassador Tom Nides told a podcast over the weekend that Israel should ""pump the brakes"" on the legislation and seek a consensus on reform that would protect Israel’s democratic institutions.His comments drew angry responses from Netanyahu allies, telling Nides to stay out of Israel’s internal affairs.The debate raged Monday from the floor of the Knesset to flag-waving demonstrations in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.Simcha Rothman, a far-right lawmaker leading the legislative initiative, presented the proposal to the parliament. Overhead in the viewing gallery, a spectator banged on the protective glass and was carried away by guards.A fellow Religious Zionism party politician posted a photo on Twitter with Rothman ahead of the vote, celebrating with whisky and sushi.Last week, some 100,000 people demonstrated outside the Knesset as a committee granted initial approval to the plan. On Monday, the crowds returned, waved Israeli flags, blew horns, and held signs reading ""saving democracy.""""All the steps that are going to take place now in the Knesset will change us to a pure dictatorship,"" said Itan Gur Aryeh, a 74-year-old retiree. ""All the power will be with the government, with the head of the government and we’ll all be without rights.""Earlier in the day, protesters launched a sit-down demonstration at the entrance of the homes of some coalition lawmakers and briefly halted traffic on Tel Aviv’s main highway. Hundreds waved Israeli flags in the seaside city and further up the coast in Haifa, holding signs reading ""resistance is mandatory.""UN RIPS ISRAEL OVER WEST BANK SETTLEMENT CONSTRUCTIONWhile Israel has long boasted of its democratic credentials, critics say that claim is tainted by the country’s West Bank occupation and the treatment of its own Palestinian minority.Israel’s Palestinian citizens, who make up about 20% of the population, have the right to vote but continue to suffer discrimination in areas like the job and housing markets. In the West Bank, Jewish settlers can vote in Israeli elections and are generally protected by Israeli laws, while Palestinians in the same territory are subject to military rule and cannot vote.The parliamentary votes seek to grant the ruling coalition more power over who becomes a judge. Today, a selection committee is made up of politicians, judges and lawyers — a system that proponents say promotes consensus.The new system would give coalition lawmakers control over the appointments. Critics fear that judges will be appointed based on their loyalty to the government or prime minister.A second change approved Monday would bar the Supreme Court from overturning what are known as ""Basic Laws,"" pieces of legislation that stand in for a constitution, which Israel does not have. Critics say that legislators will be able to dub any law a Basic Law, removing judicial oversight over controversial legislation.Also planned are proposals that would give parliament the power to overturn Supreme Court rulings and control the appointment of government legal advisers. The advisers currently are professional civil servants, and critics say the new system would politicize government ministries.Critics also fear the overhaul will grant Netanyahu an escape route from his legal woes. Netanyahu has been on trial for nearly three years for charges of accepting bribes, fraud and breach of trust. He denies wrongdoing and says he is the victim of a biased judicial system on a witch hunt against him.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIsrael’s attorney general has barred Netanyahu from any involvement in the overhaul, saying his legal troubles create a conflict of interest.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.Israel’s far-right government has granted approval for over 7,000 new homes in Jewish settlements in the West Bank, settlement backers and opponents said Thursday. The move defies growing international opposition to construction in the occupied territory.The announcement came just days after the U.N. Security Council passed a statement strongly criticizing Israeli settlement construction on occupied lands claimed by the Palestinians. The United States, Israel’s closest ally, blocked what would have been an even tougher legally binding resolution, with diplomats saying they had received Israeli assurances of refraining from unilateral acts for six months.The new approvals took place during a two-day meeting that ended Thursday and appeared to contradict those claims. The U.S. has repeatedly criticized Israeli settlement construction, saying it undermines hopes for a two-state solution with the Palestinians, but taken no action to stop it.NETANYAHU READIES STRIKE ON IRAN NUCLEAR FACILITIES AFTER SECRET MEETINGS: REPORTPeace Now, an anti-settlement watchdog group that attended the meeting, said a planning committee granted approvals for some 7,100 new housing units across the West Bank.The group said the committee scheduled a meeting next month to discuss plans to develop a strategic area east of Jerusalem known as E1. The U.S. in the past has blocked the project, which would largely bisect the West Bank and which critics say would make it impossible to establish a viable Palestinian state alongside Israel.Lior Amihai, the group's incoming director, said some 5,200 housing units were in the early stages of planning, while the remainder were approved for near-term construction. He also said construction was approved in four unauthorized outposts.Earlier this week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said he had pledged not to legalize any more wildcat outposts. He made the promise after retroactively legalizing 10 existing outposts earlier this month.  Led by Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli government has reportedly approved more than 7,000 settlement homes in the West Bank. (Ronen Zvulun/Pool Photo via AP)The Israeli government is ""spitting on the face of the U.S., only a few days after announcing that they committed to them that there would be no advancement of settlements in the near future,"" said Peace Now.The United States criticized the decision. ""We view the expansion of settlements as an obstacle to peace that undermines the geographic viability of a two-state solution,"" said a National Security Council Statement. But it gave no indication that the U.S. was prepared to act.Nabil Abu Rudeineh, spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, appealed to the United States to intervene. ""The American side is required to stop this violation, which will not lead to any peace or stability in the region,"" he said.The planned construction is likely to add to the already heightened tensions following an Israeli military raid that killed 10 Palestinians in the West Bank city of Nablus on Wednesday.UN RIPS ISRAEL OVER WEST BANK SETTLEMENT CONSTRUCTIONThe international community, along with the Palestinians, considers settlement construction illegal or illegitimate. Over 700,000 Israelis now live in the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem — territories captured by Israel in 1967 and sought by the Palestinians for a future independent state.Netanyahu’s new coalition, which took office in late December, is dominated by religious and ultranationalist politicians with close ties to the settlement movement. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a firebrand settler leader, on Thursday was officially granted Cabinet-level authority over settlement policies.Smotrich had promised earlier this month a major settlement push. His office declined to comment Thursday, but settler representatives, who also attended the planning meeting, celebrated what they said were new approvals.Yossi Dagan, a settler leader in the northern West Bank, welcomed the retroactive approval of 118 homes in ""Nofei Nehemia,"" an outpost in the northern West Bank, after a 20-year struggle. ""Great news for Samaria, for settlement and for the entire nation of Israel,"" he said, using the biblical name for the region.Shlomo Neeman, chairman of the Yesha settler’s council, declared the approvals ""a tremendous boost.""

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.Israel has told the Biden administration it will rein in the approval of new West Bank settlement outposts, the prime minister's office said Monday, a day after a potential diplomatic crisis was averted at the United Nations over Israeli-Palestinian tensions.The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would not greenlight any new wildcat settlements in the West Bank beyond nine such outposts built without authorization that it approved retroactively earlier this month. The statement, however, made no mention of the thousands of additional settlement homes in existing settlements officials say are to be soon approved.A contentious U.N. Security Council resolution pushed by the Palestinians and their supporters slated for Monday would have condemned Israel for settlement expansion and demanded a halt to future activity. According to multiple diplomats, the Biden administration managed to forestall the vote by convincing both Israel and the Palestinians to agree in principle to a six-month freeze in any unilateral action they might take.ISRAELI OFFICIALS DOUBLE DOWN ON SETTLEMENT CONSTRUCTION, REBUKE US CRITICISM""Israel notified the U.S. that in the coming months it will not authorize new settlements beyond the nine that have already been approved,"" Netanyahu's office said.The Security Council unanimously approved the watered-down statement Monday.  The Israeli government has promised the Biden administration that it will not approve any new settlements in the West Bank (AP Photo/Ariel Schalit, File)Dozens of unauthorized outposts dot the occupied West Bank, in addition to scores of existing settlements. These outposts, which sometimes are little more than a handful of trailer homes but can also resemble small villages, are built without authorization but are often tolerated and even encouraged by Israeli governments. The international community considers all Israeli construction on occupied land to be illegitimate or illegal.The U.N. vote presented a headache for the Biden administration at a time when it is focusing its diplomatic efforts on Russia's war with Ukraine, which is coming up on one year this week. Biden made a surprise visit to Kyiv on Monday.LAWMAKERS PUSH TO STOP FLOW OF US TAX DOLLARS TO 'ANTI-ISRAEL' UN OFFICEIt also highlighted the deep differences between Biden's administration, which supports Palestinian statehood and opposes settlements, and the Israeli government, which is made up of ultranationalists who oppose Palestinian independence and have pledged to ramp up settlement building.The pledge to hold off on approving outposts contradicts the government's guiding principles and Netanyahu could face a backlash from his far-right, pro-settler coalition partners. Construction in established settlements is expected to continue, as it has under successive Israeli governments.Netanyahu's office also said it would continue to demolish illegally built Palestinian homes in the 60% of the West Bank that is under full Israeli control.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.The U.N. Security Council unanimously approved a watered-down statement strongly opposing Israel’s continued construction and expansion of settlements Monday. The vote came after high-stakes negotiations by the Biden administration succeeded in derailing a legally binding resolution that would have demanded a halt to Israeli settlement activity.The Palestinian-backed draft resolution was the subject of frantic talks by senior Biden administration officials including Secretary of States Antony Blinken with Palestinian, Israeli and United Arab Emirates leaders. Those discussions culminated in a deal Sunday to forego it in favor of a weaker presidential statement that is not legally binding, according to multiple diplomats familiar with the situation.The deal averted a potential diplomatic crisis, with the U.S. almost certainly vetoing the resolution, which would have angered Palestinian supporters at a time when the U.S. and its Western allies are trying to gain international support against Russia for its war with Ukraine. The war marks its one-year anniversary of President Vladimir Putin’s invasion this week.ISRAEL PROMISES BIDEN ADMINISTRATION NO NEW OUTPOSTS IN WEST BANKBut U.S. support for the presidential statement angered Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.His office issued a blistering statement saying the Security Council statement ""negates the rights of Jews to live in their historical homeland, ignores Palestinian terror attacks in Jerusalem in which 10 Israeli citizens were murdered this month, turns a blind eye to the fact that the Palestinian Authority subsidizes terror and pays the families of terrorists, and diminishes the antisemitism that led to the murder of millions of Jews.""In an unusual criticism of Israel’s closest ally, the U.S., Netanyahu’s statement said: ""The declaration didn’t need to be said and the United States didn’t need to join it.""By contrast, Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian U.N. ambassador, welcomed the presidential statement telling reporters: ""We are very happy that there was a very strong united message from the Security Council against the illegal, unilateral measure"" announced by Israel on Feb. 12 to construct 10,000 new housing units and legalize nine new outposts in the West Bank.He also cited the council statement that Israeli settlement activities ""are dangerously imperiling the viability of the two-state solution."" It envisions Israel and Palestine living side-by-side in peace based on borders before the 1967 Mideast war.Mansour said 14 of the 15 council members supported the resolution, but one member — a clear reference to the United States — didn’t want to use its veto. ""I think the fact that we reached a unanimous agreement on a presidential statement is a very important step in the right direction,"" he said.To avoid a vote on the draft resolution, the diplomats said, the U.S. managed to convince both Israel and the Palestinians to agree in principle to a six-month freeze in any unilateral action they might take.  The United Nations issued a statement condeming the Israeli government's allowance of settlement construction in the disputed West Bank territory. (AP Photo/Mahmoud Illean)On the Israeli side, that would mean a commitment to not expanding settlements until at least August, according to the diplomats. On Monday, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would not greenlight any new wildcat settlements in the West Bank beyond nine outposts that it approved retroactively earlier this month.On the Palestinian side, the diplomats said it would mean a commitment until August not to pursue action against Israel at the U.N. and other international bodies such as the World Court, the International Criminal Court and the U.N. Human Rights Council. But Mansour said the U.N. General Assembly’s request to the U.N.’s highest judicial body, the International Court of Justice also known as the World Court for an advisory opinion on the legality of Israeli politcies in the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem is going ahead.The Palestinian push for a resolution came after Israel’s new right-wing government reaffirmed its commitment to construct new settlements in the West Bank and expand its authority on land the Palestinians seek for a future state.Israel captured the West Bank, along with east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, in the 1967 Mideast war. The United Nations and most of the international community consider Israeli settlements illegal and an obstacle to ending the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Some 700,000 Israeli settlers live in the West Bank and Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem.The presidential statement does not condemn Israeli settlement activity or demand a halt. It does condemn ""all acts of violence against civilians, including acts of terrorism.""On settlements, the Security Council statement also ""strongly opposes all unilateral measures that impede peace including … Israeli construction and expansion of settlements, confiscation of Palestinians’ land, and the `legalization’ of settlement outposts, demolition of Palestinians’ homes and displacement of Palestinian civilians.""UAE Ambassador Lana Nusseibeh, the council’s Arab representative who sponsored the resolution, commended the U.S. role and said the statement is ""the first output from the Security Council in six years on the situation in Palestine.""ISRAELI OFFICIALS DOUBLE DOWN ON SETTLEMENT CONSTRUCTION, REBUKE US CRITICISMIn December 2016, the Security Council demanded that Israel ""immediately and completely cease all settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem."" It stressed that halting settlement activities ""is essential for salvaging the two-state solution.""That resolution was adopted after President Barack Obama’s administration abstained in the vote, a reversal of the United States’ longstanding practice of protecting its close ally Israel from action at the United Nations, including by vetoing Arab-supported resolutions.The presidential statement was read at the start of the council’s monthly Mideast meeting by its president, Malta’s U.N. Ambassador Vanessa Frazier.U.N. Mideast envoy Tor Wennesland then warned the council that ""we are witnessing"" a surge in violence ""including some of the deadliest incidents in nearly 20 years,"" expressing concern that the negative trajectory is ""gaining in both pace and intensity.""

Brad Cooper also told The Associated Press that he's seen a rise in what he described as Iran's ""malign activities"" in the region over his two years leading the Bahrain-based 5th Fleet.While Cooper pointed to recent seizures of weapons by American and allied forces in the region as a success, he acknowledged that Iran has been able to carry out drone attacks targeting shipping in the Mideast and other assaults in the region.""We’re focused on expanding our partnerships,"" Cooper said on the sidelines of Abu Dhabi's International Defense Exhibition and Conference.
