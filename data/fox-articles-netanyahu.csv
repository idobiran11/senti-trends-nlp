Justice Minister Yariv Levin has argued that the hight court has surpassed its authority in the last two decades and severely interfered with the ability of elected coalitions and ministers to enact government policies.

They want a substantive discussion, and in the end, they want unity,"" he said.Despite Herzog's plea the Knesset's constitution, law, and justice Committee, headed by MK Simcha Rothman, approved the second bill that would prevent the Supreme Court from overruling legislation amending one of Israel's semi-constitutional basic laws – effectively restricting the court's power of judicial review on core issues.The vote now sends the legislation to the entire parliament for a series of votes. The step caused chaos in the committee, as opposition members who objected to the move shouted at Rothman 'shame' and were removed from the meeting.

In the Palestinian territories, it's illegal to sell land to Jews or Israelis, with punishments ranging from hard labor to prison to execution.Friedman went on to quote a past column of his arguing Netanyahu was able to address Congress in the past because he was ""bought and paid for by AIPAC."" The exact wording of the 2011 article was that the standing ovation the prime minister got in Congress was ""bought and paid for by the Israel lobby"" — a statement for which he received significant backlash.Friedman's remarks seem to echo those of Rep.

Such a move would draw widespread backlash.Israel captured the West Bank, along with east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, in the 1967 Mideast war.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a surprise trip to Jordan on Tuesday to meet with King Abdullah II for the first time in over four years, seeking to shore up ties that have strained since he took office at the helm of Israel's most right-wing government in history.The rare meeting between the leaders, who have long had a rocky relationship, comes as tensions grow over Israel’s new ultranationalist government, which took office late last year. The talks centered around the status of a contested holy site in the Old City of Jerusalem sacred to both Jews and Muslims, an emotional issue at the heart of the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, Jordan's official statement indicated.Jordan's royal court said the king urged Israel to respect the status quo at the sacred compound, which Muslims call the Noble Sanctuary and Jews call the Temple Mount. The compound — the third-holiest site in Islam — sits on a sprawling plateau also home to the iconic golden Dome of the Rock.ISRAEL, JORDAN SIGN DECLARATION OF INTENT AT UN CLIMATE CONFERENCE TO CONSERVE, PROTECT JORDAN RIVERUnder an arrangement that has prevailed for decades under Jordan's custodianship, Jews and non-Muslims are permitted visits during certain hours but may not pray there. But Jewish religious nationalists, including members of Israel's new governing coalition, have increasingly visited the site and demanded equal prayer rights for Jews there, infuriating the Palestinians and Muslims around the world.In Tuesday's meeting, King Abdullah II also pushed Israel to ""stop its acts of violence"" that are undermining hopes for an eventual peaceful settlement to the decadeslong Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the Jordanian government added, reaffirming its support for a two-state solution. Israel's new coalition has vowed to expand Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and even annex the territory, making a future independent Palestinian state unviable.

(Abir Sultan/Pool Photo via AP)Netanyahu’s office said he discussed ""regional issues"" and security and economic cooperation with Jordan, a key regional ally. Jordan’s 1994 treaty normalizing ties with Israel produced a chilly-at-best peace between the former enemies.The Jordanian government has already summoned the Israeli ambassador to Amman twice in the last month since Israel's new government took office — both times after an incident at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound. Netanyahu has repeatedly offered assurances that there has been no change in the status quo at the site.ISRAEL URGES CITIZENS TO 'DOWNPLAY' THEIR ISRAELI IDENTITY AT QATAR WORLD CUP FOR THEIR OWN 'SECURITY'Earlier this month, Israel’s new hard-line minister of national security, Itamar Ben-Gvir, made a provocative visit to the site, drawing condemnations from Jordan and across the Arab world. Jordan also protested to Israel after Israeli police briefly blocked the Jordanian ambassador from entering the Al-Aqsa Mosque, decrying the move as an affront to Jordan's role as custodian.The compound is administered by Jordanian religious authorities as part of an unofficial agreement after Israel captured east Jerusalem, along with the West Bank and Gaza, in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel is in charge of security at the site. Because of Jordan’s special role and the site’s importance to Muslims around the world, whatever happens at the site has regional implications.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe site emerged as a major flashpoint between Israel and the Muslim world in 2017, when Israel placed metal detectors, cameras and other security measures at entrances to the compound in response to a deadly Palestinian attack there.

The baby was the only member of her family to survive from the building collapse Monday in the small town of Jinderis, next to the Turkish border, Ramadan Sleiman, a relative, told The Associated Press.Monday’s pre-dawn 7.8 magnitude earthquake, followed by multiple aftershocks, caused widespread destruction across southern Turkey and northern Syria.

After rescuers dug her out, a female neighbor cut the cord, and she and others rushed with the baby to a children’s hospital in the nearby town of Afrin, where she has been kept on an incubator, said the doctor treating the baby, Dr. Hani Maarouf.Video of the rescue circulating on social media shows the moments after the baby was removed from the rubble, as a man lifts her up, her umbilical cord still dangling, and rushes away as another man throws him a blanket to wrap her in.The baby’s body temperature had fallen to 95 degrees Fahrenheit and she had bruises, including a large one on her back, but she is in stable condition, he said.Abu Hadiya must have been conscious during the birth and must have died soon after, Maarouf said.

Tensions have soared in the Israeli-annexed eastern half of the city, following a Palestinian shooting attack outside a synagogue on Jan. 27 that killed seven people in the deadliest attack in Jerusalem in over a decade.The Israeli rescue service identified the two killed as a six-year-old boy and a man in his 20s. It said medics were treating five injured, including an eight-year-old child in critical condition undergoing CPR. Others, ages ranging from 10 to 40, were in moderate to serious condition.

" close      Video Former Iranian official writes letter to Iran's Supreme Leader over protests Fox News correspondent Amy Kellogg interviews former Iranian diplomat, Mehrdad Khonsari, on the country's ongoing protests. 'No way to turn clock back.'Iran has enough highly enriched uranium to build ""several"" nuclear weapons if it chooses, the United Nations’ top nuclear official is now warning. But diplomatic efforts aimed at again limiting its atomic program seem more unlikely than ever before as Tehran arms Russia in its war on Ukraine and as unrest shakes the Islamic Republic.While offering a caveat on Tuesday that ""we need to be extremely careful"" in describing Iran’s program, Rafael Mariaono Grossi of the International Atomic Energy Agency bluntly acknowledged just how large Tehran’s high-enriched uranium stockpile had grown.""One thing is true: They have amassed enough nuclear material for several nuclear weapons, not one at this point,"" Grossi said.Gross assured a European Parliament subcommittee in Brussels on Wednesday that Iran has not yet built a nuclear weapon and the West should redouble efforts to stop them from doing so. Even at the height of previous tensions between the West and Iran, before the 2015 nuclear deal, Iran never enriched uranium as high as it does now.For months, nonproliferation experts have suggested Iran had enough uranium enriched up to 60% to build at least one nuclear weapon — though Tehran long has insisted its program is for peaceful purposes. Uranium enriched to more than 90% can be weaponized. Iran has 70 kilograms (154 pounds) of uranium enriched to 60% purity and 1,000 kilograms to 20% purity, Grossi shared.

The question is at what stage can we stop Iran from getting the bomb,"" Netanyahu said.IRAN HOLDS TOP MILITARY DRILLS IN MAJOR OIL WATERWAY IN 'WAR BEFORE THE WAR'Analysts point to what happened with North Korea, which had reached a 1994 deal with the U.S. to abandon its nuclear weapons program. The deal fell apart in 2002. By 2005 and wary of U.S. intentions after its invasion of Iraq, Pyongyang announced it had built nuclear weapons. Today, North Korea has ballistic missiles designed to carry nuclear warheads that are capable of reaching the U.S.Iranian diplomats for years have pointed to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s preachings as a binding fatwa, or religious edict, that Iran wouldn’t seek an atomic bomb. However, Iranian officials in recent months have begun openly talking about the prospect of building nuclear weapons.Talks between Iran and the West ended in August with a ""final text"" of a roadmap on restoring the 2015 deal that Iran until today hasn’t accepted.  International Atomic Energy Agency Director-General Rafael Mariano Grossi, right, speaks with Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian, left, during their meeting in Tehran, Iran, March 5, 2022.  (AP Photo, File)As Iran’s rial currency plunges further to historic lows against the dollar amid its crises, Iranian officials including Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian also have made unsupported claims about American officials agreeing to their demands or frozen money abroad being released.At the U.S. State Department, the denials about Iran’s claims have grown more and more pointed.""We’ve heard a number of statements from the Iranian foreign minister that are dubious if not outright lies, so I would just keep that broader context in mind when you point to statements from the Iranian foreign minister,"" State Department spokesperson Ned Price said Monday in a response to a question.IRAN EXECUTION OF BRITISH NATIONAL SHATTERS RELATIONS, UK RECONSIDERS NUCLEAR DEAL SUPPORT: REPORTIn Dec. 2022, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said that the Iran nuclear deal is ""not our focus right now,"" noting the administration was instead focusing on supporting citizens protesting the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained in September by the country’s morality police.""Iran’s demands are unrealistic. They go well beyond the scope of the JCPOA,"" Price said, using the acronym for the deal, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.Critics say the Biden administration’s statements over this month show its unfailing allegiance to JCPOA that, according to one U.S. think tank study, would funnel $275 billion in benefits to Tehran in its first year and $1 trillion by 2030. A spokesman for Senator Cruz, R-Texas, told Fox News Digital that ""Sen. Cruz believes that the Biden administration is ideologically obsessed with reentering a nuclear deal with Iran, and that they are doing everything possible to keep that possibility open. He believes that they prioritize the deal above other critical interests they claim they have, including supporting the women-led protests against the Iranian regime and helping our Ukrainian allies take out the Russian and Iranian forces using drones to devastate Ukrainian military and civilian targets.""

At least 527 people have been killed and over 19,500 arrested amid the unrest, according to Human Rights Activists in Iran, a group monitoring the protests.CRITICS CALL OUT BIDEN ADMINISTRATION FOR NOT WALKING AWAY FROM IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL DESPITE RECENT RHETORICAnother part of the Americans’ exasperation — and increasingly of the Europeans as well — comes from Iran arming Russia with the bomb-carrying drones that repeatedly have targeted power plants and civilian targets across Ukraine. It remains unclear what Tehran, which has a strained history with Moscow, expects to get for supplying Russia with arms. One Iranian lawmaker has suggested the Islamic Republic could get Sukhoi Su-35 fighter jets to replace its aging fleeting composed primarily of pre-1979 American warplanes, though such a deal hasn’t been confirmed.Such fighter jets would provide a key air defense for Iran, particularly as its nuclear sites could increasingly be eyed.
