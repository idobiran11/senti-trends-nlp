JERUSALEM – Former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu looked set to return to power on Wednesday after an unprecedented fifth general election in less than four years on Tuesday gave his Likud Party, and others loyal to him, a narrow majority in the country’s parliament, the Knesset. A victory for the longest-serving Israeli leader, who was ousted to the opposition more than a year ago, means he will now be able to form a stable and ideologically aligned coalition, which critics are already calling the most right-wing government in Israel’s 74-year history. With close to ninety percent of the votes counted it looks like the Likud leader will be asked to form the next government.In his celebratory speech as the results became clearer, Netanyahu thanked those who supported him and called the win a ""massive vote of confidence from the Israeli public."" He also declared he would form a coalition with the ""national camp,"" a collection of controversial right-wing religious and ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties that have committed to join him in forming a strong and stable government. NETANYAHU PLOTS RETURN AS ISRAELIS VOTE FOR NEW GOVERNMENT  Benjamin Netanyahu is on the verge of becoming Israel's next prime minister. Netanyahu is expected to lead a coalition with the support of nationalist and religious parties. Netanyahu greeted supporters Tuesday night at Likud's HQ in Jerusalem, Israel. (AP Photo/Maya Alleruzzo)""The way I see it is that this is the biggest political victory that Netanyahu has ever achieved, at least since his first victory in 1996 and at least in terms of the numbers, Aviv Bushinsky, a political commentator and a former chief of staff for Netanyahu, said in an interview with journalists. In the days leading up to the vote, Netanyahu traveled the length and breadth of the country urging the Israeli public to go out and vote after predictions of public fatigue and apathy suggested there would be a low turnout at the polls. His hard work appeared to pay off Tuesday, with official figures showing Israeli voting patterns were the highest in 20 years and many of those casting ballots came from the right of the political map. Also giving him a massive boost was the rise of a once-marginalized far-right nationalist conglomeration of parties united under the banner of Religious Zionism. The faction, which looks set to become the third-largest party in the Knesset, is now the potential kingmaker of this election with the power to crown Netanyahu prime minister. ISRAEL ELECTION: PRELIMINARY RESULTS SHOW NETANYAHU POISED TO RETURN TO POWER   Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich are expected to be part of any new government led by Netanyahu. Their ultra-nationalist party is presently the third-biggest vote getter following Tuesday's election in Israel.

Kahana was assassinated by a terrorist in New York in 1990. Both men have sparked controversy in Israel and abroad for their extremist views, particularly towards Israel’s Arab population and over plans to reform the country’s judicial system, which they claim is corrupt, biased and far too powerful. While Israel’s parliamentary system means that no single political party can win an election outright, the largest party is usually the one afforded the first chance to try forming a coalition with other factions. It is a complicated jigsaw of smaller parties that typically align with similar ideologies. However, Netanyahu, who is also embroiled in a high-profile criminal trial over allegations of breach of trust, bribery and fraud, has struggled over the past four years to put together an ideologically aligned coalition as many of his traditional allies have refused to overlook his legal woes. ISRAEL ELECTION: WITH DIVISIONS DEEPENING, ISRAELIS TO DECIDE IF NETANYAHU SHOULD RETURN TO POWERNow, however, Netanyahu has the option of joining forces with Religious Zionism, which he has committed to doing so throughout his campaign, despite concerns raised by Israel’s supporters in the United States, including the administration of President Biden.   Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid's Yesh Atid Party trailed behind Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Party as votes continue to be counted in Israel's election.

In a few moments, we are going to run our just-completed interview with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is out with a brand new book: ""Bibi: My Story."" It’s a great read.  Today, as you may know, is the fifth anniversary of the decision by former President Donald Trump to move the American embassy to Jerusalem. Prime Minister Netanyahu called that a crucial decision — indeed, he called it a biblical decision, going back 3,000 years — and we discussed how that decision was a major contributor to the peace agreement that came to be known as the Abraham Accords, which was completed a few years later. That was between the U.S., Israel, the UAE, Bahrain, Morocco, Sudan and Kosovo.  Now, the prime minister and I also talked about how his courageous speech before Congress, back in 2015, where he laid out his disagreements with the Obama administration regarding a nuclear deal with Iran and some other things — how that speech (which is a prominent part of Mr. Netanyahu's new book) may itself have laid the intellectual groundwork for the embassy move to Jerusalem and the Abraham Accords and a complete shift away from the central role of Palestine and toward a new peace in the Middle East based on diplomacy, trade and investment between Israel and its Arab neighbors.   Also, the prime minister and I spent some time talking about, you guessed it, free-market economics and how he was able to change Israel's socialist state into a capitalist one.   JAMIE DIMON WARNS INFLATION COULD DRAG US INTO RECESSION NEXT YEAR: 'IT COULD BE A HURRICANE' close      video Rep.

But the Prime Minister, while taking that advice, added to it the need to cut the heavy hand of government in order to lighten the burden on free enterprise and entrepreneurship.  So, you’ve got limited government, spending cuts, tax cuts, deregulation — all that work to turn Israel into a dynamic, entrepreneurial, technology-led economy, whose per-capita GDP now exceeds France, the United Kingdom, Germany and a couple of others. On top of all that, Israel finally privatized its energy agency and guess what?

And I think people ask themselves, ‘Do we want the ayatollahs, who chant death to America, to have the weapons of mass death and the ballistic missiles to deliver them to any part on Earth?’ and the answer is of course not.""As the protests calling for an end to the Islamic regime have gone on, news came out that Iran was enriching uranium at an underground facility at a level approaching what is needed for a nuclear weapon. Asked if he is concerned that continued pressure from the demonstrations could make Iran more erratic, Netanyahu did not dismiss the idea but said the protests are exposing Tehran and showing the leadership's vulnerability.IRANIAN GENERAL ACKNOWLEDGES 300 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED IN UNREST DURING NATIONWIDE PROTESTS Video""I suppose so, but I think that it also highlights the fact that they’re really weak – that they govern only with basically the threat of murder,"" he said. ""And the people are showing remarkable resilience.""As an example of the resolve of the Iranian people, Netanyahu referenced the Iranian World Cup soccer team remaining silent during their national anthem before their first game of the tournament.WATCH MORE OF FOX NEWS DIGITAL'S INTERVIEW WITH BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: ON HIS NEW BOOK, RISING ANTISEMITISM, AND CRITICISM OF HIS COALITION PARTNERS Video""The whole world is watching, and the entire team refused to sing the anthem, not because they’re not Iranian patriots, because they are,"" he said. ""Because they know their country has been hijacked by this gang of theological thugs who govern simply by terror. And the fact that the entire world sees that I think has made the possibility of stopping Iran’s nuclear program and rolling back the tide of this horribly aggressive regime possible.""Netanyahu observed that both sides of the political spectrum are more united against Iran now than they had been before. Whether or not this results in actually stopping Iran, he said, ""depends on how much the community of like-minded nations unites"" to keep them from getting a nuclear weapon.Netanyahu said that in order to do this, both ""crippling sanctions"" and a military threat are needed. Regarding the latter, he said Israel is prepared to act regardless of U.S. approval, although he believes that there may now be a more ""forward-leaning American position on this matter.""US AND ISRAEL DISCUSS MILITARY DRILL TO SIMULATE CONFLICT WITH IRAN, PROXIESNetanyahu angered many American officials in 2015 when he accepted an invitation to appear before a joint session of Congress and speak against the Iran nuclear deal – against the position of then-President Barack Obama. Netanyahu said he respected Obama but disagreed with him on this issue. Going against the president at that time ""wasn’t an easy decision,"" Netanyahu said, but it was a decision he made out of concern for Israel’s survival.As it turned out, that speech may have helped lead to the one of the most remarkable regional developments in recent memory: emerging peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors.  Abraham Accords signing ceremony at the White House on Sept. 13, 2020. (Getty)""In the course of giving that speech in Congress, our delegation received calls from Gulf governments – Arab governments in the Gulf – who said, ‘We don’t believe what we’re seeing. We don’t believe that your prime minister is willing to take this stand against an American president. It’s very hard,'"" Netanyahu recalled. ""And that’s what led to meetings in 2015, clandestine meetings with Gulf Arab leaders … and that created the foundations for the Abraham Accords.""The Abraham Accords are the peace agreements Israel made with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan. Netanyahu hinted that more countries could join in the future, predicting that ""the best is yet to come.""WATCH MORE OF FOX NEWS DIGITAL'S INTERVIEW WITH BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: ON THE DOJ'S PROBE OF SHIREEN ABU AKLEH'S DEATH, AND HIS OWN POLITICAL COMEBACK VideoNetanyahu said that the developing peace with Arab nations debunked the long-standing myth that regional stability would not come until after Israel made peace with the Palestinians.2 US CITIZENS INJURED IN JERUSALEM DURING DEADLY TERROR ATTACK, AMBASSADOR SAYS""That’s inside out. My argument is the exact opposite: it’s outside in. Complete the circle of peace with the entire Arab world and then get to the Palestinians,"" Netanyahu said. ""And perhaps then we could have them abandon their idea that they’ll do away with the Jewish State once they recognize the right – not merely the fact, but the right – of Israel to exist as a Jewish state, then I think we’ll be well on the way to a solution with them as well.""The Israeli-Palestinian conflict had long been emblematic of a greater conflict between Israel and the Arab world, but that no longer seems to be the case as the local conflict continues despite Arab countries improving relations with the Jewish state. Most recently, Israel was hit by two explosions at Jerusalem bus stops, attacks that Hamas, the group in control of the Gaza Strip that the U.S. has on its list of designated terror organizations, praised, according to Reuters.  The cover of former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's new book, which covers his military service, work in politics and insights from his career. (Simon & Schuster)Hamas is backed by Iran, setting it apart from much of the Arab world. Netanyahu noted that ""the rise of Iran's threat"" was one of ""the foundations"" of the Abraham Accords, along with Israel's growing military and technological power.Another recent point of conflict between Israel and Palestinians involved the death of Palestinian-American Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh. Palestinians quickly blamed Israel, and Israel later stated that Abu Akleh was likely accidentally killed by gunfire from Israeli Defense Forces. The U.S. Department of Justice said they were going to investigate the matter. Current Prime Minister Yair Lapid came out against this, and Netanyahu echoed that sentiment.""Israel has its own investigatory powers,"" Netanyahu said, adding that the IDF has ""really meticulous internal mechanisms"" to handle such situations.""You would not want us to investigate an event in America if you had something happen, a similar tragedy happening in our military,"" Netanyahu said, adding that Israel has investigated and will continue to investigate Abu Akleh's death.ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER CALLS US INVESTIGATION INTO JOURNALIST'S KILLING A ‘GRAVE MISTAKE’Netanyahu himself has also drawn criticism from U.S. officials, including longtime supporter of Israel Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., over far-right members of the coalition that Netanyahu is looking to form to set up a new government that he would lead as prime minister. In particular, Menendez reportedly referenced the inclusion of individuals like Itamar Ben-Gvir.Critics have painted Ben-Gvir as a right-wing extremist for his connections and support of far right-wing elements in Israel, including the late Rabbi Meir Kahane, whose ultra-nationalist party was outlawed from running in subsequent elections for inciting racism against Arabs. Kahane was assassinated by a terrorist in Manhattan in 1990. Ben-Gvir said that Menendez's criticism was ""incorrect and mistaken.""Netanyahu said the criticism was not ""morally or logically consistent,"" calling out Menendez and others for being silent when his opposition aligned themselves with supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood. Netanyahu accused that group of supporting terror while his partners ""support the Jewish State.""Netanyahu's likely return to the prime minister's office comes nearly a year and a half after he was voted out. During his time away from office, he wrote a memoir, ""Bibi: My Story,"" in which he discusses his military and political career as well as his family, which includes Israeli hero Yoni Netanyahu, who died during a daring hostage rescue mission in Entebbe, Uganda, in 1976. VideoNetanyahu said that having time away from the prime minister's office ""renewed"" his energy to reenter the ""cruel"" world of politics.""The reason I came back to power is because I live a life of purpose. And my purpose is to protect the Jewish state and make sure that Israel has a … secure and prosperous existence for the decades to come,"" he said.Netanyahu also addressed a problem facing Jews worldwide: rising antisemitism. The issue has especially been impacting Jews in the U.S. in recent weeks following the spread of antisemitic comments and tropes by notable figures such as Kanye ""Ye"" West and NBA player Kyrie Irving.Asked about whether influential figures such as Ye and Irving could empower other antisemites, Netanyahu agreed that this is a concern.""Yes, I think that's clear,"" he said, calling antisemitism ""a chronic disease"" that ""changes its form"" over the 2,500 years that it has existed.""People look for a scapegoat,"" he said. ""You're a capitalist, you blame the Jews who are the communists. You're a communist, the Jews are the capitalists. You have a problem, blame the Jews.""CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPNetanyahu said the only real defense against antisemitism is to ""take a strong stance against it."" He also pointed out that the existence of the state of Israel gives Jews a means of defense, be it militarily, morally, politically or otherwise.""The rebirth of Israel was meant to give a defense against antisemitism,"" he said.Fox News's Benjamin Weinthal contributed to this report.

Other protests where also held across the country.The demonstrators, marched and gathered outside the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, held flags and chanted ""democracy"" and ""no to dictatorship"" as Netanyahu's government formally launched a controversial plan to overhaul the country's judicial system.According to the suggested plan, which was introduced mid-January, the ruling coalition will have control over the appointment of judges, including high court justices, and allow the Knesset to re-legislate laws the court annuls with a majority of a simple majority of 61 of the 120 Knesset members. The government will also be able to appoint the president and vice president of the supreme court neither of whom needed to have previously served on the court and potentially not even served as a lower court judge. Justice Minister Yariv Levin has argued that the hight court has surpassed its authority in the last two decades and severely interfered with the ability of elected coalitions and ministers to enact government policies.  Some 80,000 Israelis gathered to protest against judicial reforms pushed by the government of Benjamin Netanyahu. (Maya Meshel)BENJAMIN NETANYAHU RETURNS TO POWER IN ISRAEL AS NEW GOVERNMENT IS SWORN INAddressing the tens of thousands of protesters, Eliad Shraga, founder and chairman of the Movement for Quality Government in Israel, and one of the protest organizers, opened his speech with a quote from the Book of Isaiah: ""Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me."" Isaiah was the prophet who foresaw the destruction of the Second Temple, and Shraga warned of the destruction of the third temple; the state of Israel.He warned that, ""Night and day, in the constitution, law and justice committee, he is moving the anti-democratic legislation forward, the laws that will transform Israel overnight from a liberal democracy into a fascist dictatorship.""On Sunday, President Isaac Herzog appealed to Netanyahu and his coalition allies to suspend the legislation and open a dialogue with the opposition in a special televised address to the nation. Netanyahu has not responded to the appeal.Herzog emphasized the importance of reaching a broad compromise and presented his five-point plan for Israel's balance of powers.    Israelis wave national flags during protest against plans by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's new government to overhaul the judicial system, outside the Knesset, Israel's parliament, in Jerusalem, Monday, Feb. 13, 2023.

""I feel – we all feel – that we are moments from a crash, perhaps even a violent one,"" he said. ""Both sides must understand that if only one side wins – no matter which side it is – we will all lose. The State of Israel will lose.""Netanyahu released a short video following Monday's mass demonstration where he called on the leaders of opposition to ""Stop it. Stop deliberately deteriorating the country into anarchy. Take care of yourselves, and show responsibility and leadership. Most Israeli citizens do not want anarchy. They want a substantive discussion, and in the end, they want unity,"" he said.Despite Herzog's plea the Knesset's constitution, law, and justice Committee, headed by MK Simcha Rothman, approved the second bill that would prevent the Supreme Court from overruling legislation amending one of Israel's semi-constitutional basic laws – effectively restricting the court's power of judicial review on core issues.The vote now sends the legislation to the entire parliament for a series of votes. The step caused chaos in the committee, as opposition members who objected to the move shouted at Rothman 'shame' and were removed from the meeting.

(Video: Ariel Tanaami/TPS.) Israelis go to the polls on Tuesday to elect a new government. Netanyahu is once again hoping to become prime minister. (Credit: Ariel Tanaami/TPS.)JERUSALEM – Tuesday could be a big day for former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. As Israelis returned to the polls for a fifth time in less than four years, the former Israeli leader is growing increasingly hopeful that a whirlwind election campaign and more than a year in opposition will be enough to propel him back into power.However, his path to the premiership is complicated. First by the fact that he is currently embroiled in a high-profile criminal trial that includes charges of bribery, fraud, and breach of trust, and secondly by the other political parties he might need in order to build his future coalition, which includes a faction made up of controversial far right-wing politicians.Netanyahu, the longest-serving leader in Israel’s history, was ousted in the last round of voting in March 2021. Since then, he has watched from the opposition bench as his rivals – first Naftali Bennett and now Yair Lapid – ran the country with a fragile government coalition that included, for the first time ever, a controversial party from the country’s minority Arab sector. In an interview on Friday with Fox News Digital, Netanyahu said that he felt confident he could win this election and return to power with a more solid and ideologically aligned government.   Supporters of Benjamin Netanyahu take part in a rally Oct. 28 in support of the former prime minister.

They’re actually part of the existing coalition that was unraveled and that is unfathomable because these people don't recognize the Jewish state and they support the terrorists who seek to murder Israelis."" Netanyahu said he believed that many Israelis wanted to see him return, leading a government that is ""committed to Israel as a Jewish state"" and ""to restoring a powerful economy and a powerful military and security for all Israelis."" Netanyahu’s confidence about returning to power is reflected somewhat in polls published over the past few weeks that show he might have an easier time getting re-elected than Yair Lapid, who has served as interim prime minister since June, when Bennett announced his withdrawal from Israeli politics after calling the election five months ago. However, he also faces a myriad of challenges that could leave him permanently ousted.  While Israel’s fragmented parliamentary system means that no single political party can win an election outright, the polls suggest that a group of right-wing, religious parties that have committed to supporting Netanyahu’s leadership bid could collectively garner the requisite number of seats in Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, to form the next government.   Likud Party head and former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks to his supporters as he visits at Hatikva Market in Tel Aviv, Israel, Friday, Oct. 28, 2022, during his campaign ahead of the country's election.

Polls published Friday, the final day polling is allowed under the law, show Netanyahu and the parties committed to his return reaching only 60 – although with a margin of error and final days of intensive campaigning that number could certainly rise.  ""Any small changes in the vote choice between the camps or within the camps can have a significant impact,"" said Dr. Liron Lavi, a lecturer in the Department of Political Studies at Bar Ilan University. Additionally, Lavi pointed out that while Netanyahu might certainly choose to form a government with the parties that have backed him through the campaign – two ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties and a nationalist religious party – if his own Likud Party succeeds in garnering a larger number of voters, he would be better positioned to negotiate an alternative coalition, possibly with the party headed by the current Defense Minister Benny Gantz.   President Biden is greeted by Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid, and President Isaac Herzog, left, as during Biden's visit to Israel in July 2022.

""In this election, however, the size of the party is crucial, especially for Likud, because a large Likud will give Netanyahu the flexibility to choose his coalition partners."" Netanyahu has faced criticism both within Israel and outside for saying he is willing to include the national religious party – Religious Zionism – in a future coalition. The confab, which consists of three far-right parties, features characters such as Itamar Ben-Gvir, a disciple of the American Rabbi and Knesset Member Meir Kahana, who was assassinated by a terrorist in New York in 1990, and Bezalel Smotrich, a former Transport Minister, who is an outspoken advocate for Israeli settlement on lands Palestinians hope for a future state. ISRAEL ELECTION: WITH DIVISIONS DEEPENING, ISRAELIS TO DECIDE IF NETANYAHU SHOULD RETURN TO POWER  Israeli far-right lawmaker and the head of the ""Jewish Power"" Party Itamar Ben-Gvir visits at Hatikva Market in Tel Aviv during his campaign ahead of the country's election on Nov.1 as Israel heads to its fifth election in under four years.

The two have also hinted at their willingness to halt the criminal proceedings against Netanyahu, a step that has those opposed to his return up in arms. When asked by Fox News about Ben-Gvir’s party joining his coalition, Netanyahu called the concern ""ridiculous."" ""I've had parties on my right, including a party of this same persuasion, and they didn't control the policy,"" Netanyahu told Fox. ""For God sakes, we're the biggest party I'm the prime minister, and we control policy."" ""I always questioned the people who level this question against me,"" he continued.""I said, Where were you when the current government has made a coalition with the Muslim Brotherhood that wants to see the disappearance of Israel and doesn't accept the United States as currently formed? How come you’re speaking of people who recognize the Jewish state, who support the IDF, or who have been cleared by our Supreme Court, which vets all the parties? It just doesn't make sense.""On Monday, with less than 24 hours to go until the polls open, Netanyahu made a dramatic announcement that he was growing concerned about voter turnout for those affiliated with Likud and called an emergency strategy meeting at his headquarters in Tel Aviv.

Netanyahu is once again hoping to become prime minister. (Credit: Ariel Tanaami/TPS)JERUSALEM, Israel – As polls closed on yet another election day in Israel, millions of Israelis waited anxiously to see if, after five rounds of voting in less than four years, they would be able to finally choose a clear winner and produce a stable government to successfully run the country.Preliminary results show that former prime minister and current opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu might very well be that winner this time around. His bloc of right-wing, religious parties is slated to draw up to 62 seats, the number of mandates needed to form a majority in the 120-seat Knesset, Israel’s parliament. Yesh Atid, the party of Netanyahu’s main rival, interim Prime Minister Yair Lapid, appeared set to garner only 24 seats, according to the polls. The assortment of parties that would be willing to support him in forming an anti-Netanyahu government were only slated to reach 55 seats. Two key parties appeared as though they would not pass the electoral threshold. The final result of what could be the country’s most decisive election yet — bringing an end to an endless cycle of elections — will not be known for at least the next few hours and possibly the next few days or even weeks, if votes are contested. In addition, if any of the parties hovering at the electoral threshold do indeed break through, the final numbers could change dramatically.

Israel’s Central Election Committee said that overall voter turnout was the highest ever since the 1999 election — a vote that saw Netanyahu, in his first round as prime minister, defeated by former prime minister Ehud Barak. While Israel’s parliamentary system means that no single political party can win an election outright, the largest party is usually the one afforded the first chance to try forming a coalition with other factions.

It is these charges, which include activities involving lavish gifts and high-stakes business deals with millionaires and national infrastructure companies, that forced the former prime minister to first call an election in Dec. 2018. Breaking up his government four years ago, Netanyahu was hoping for a decisive election result that would shore up his support and prove that despite the criminal investigations, he was still beloved by a loyal public. Following an election in April 2019, however, he was unable to pull together a government, with key allies and political partners unwilling to overlook his legal woes. Netanyahu was forced to call an unprecedented second election five months later.   The Israeli-Arab vote was said to be lower this time around. Netanyahu recently told Fox News Digital that he and his party Likud are popular within the community.  (AP Photo/Mahmoud Illean)The September 2019 vote also produced no clear winner and no clear path for Netanyahu — or any other political leader — to establish a government and the country was forced to hold a third election in March 2020, which produced a short-lived coalition with current Defense Minister Benny Gantz. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThat shaky alliance lasted less than a year before a fourth election was held in March 2021, with Netanyahu’s rivals, including for the first time ever an Arab-Israeli political party, finally ousting him from power. Naftali Bennett, a former Netanyahu ally, became prime minister, with Lapid, serving initially as alternate prime minister. But internal disagreements — mainly over core ideological differences between the eight factions — led to that government's downfall in June. Tuesday’s vote appears to make it unlikely that such an alliance will arise again this time.  Ruth Marks Eglash is a veteran journalist based in Jerusalem, Israel.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a surprise trip to Jordan on Tuesday to meet with King Abdullah II for the first time in over four years, seeking to shore up ties that have strained since he took office at the helm of Israel's most right-wing government in history.The rare meeting between the leaders, who have long had a rocky relationship, comes as tensions grow over Israel’s new ultranationalist government, which took office late last year. The talks centered around the status of a contested holy site in the Old City of Jerusalem sacred to both Jews and Muslims, an emotional issue at the heart of the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, Jordan's official statement indicated.Jordan's royal court said the king urged Israel to respect the status quo at the sacred compound, which Muslims call the Noble Sanctuary and Jews call the Temple Mount. The compound — the third-holiest site in Islam — sits on a sprawling plateau also home to the iconic golden Dome of the Rock.ISRAEL, JORDAN SIGN DECLARATION OF INTENT AT UN CLIMATE CONFERENCE TO CONSERVE, PROTECT JORDAN RIVERUnder an arrangement that has prevailed for decades under Jordan's custodianship, Jews and non-Muslims are permitted visits during certain hours but may not pray there. But Jewish religious nationalists, including members of Israel's new governing coalition, have increasingly visited the site and demanded equal prayer rights for Jews there, infuriating the Palestinians and Muslims around the world.In Tuesday's meeting, King Abdullah II also pushed Israel to ""stop its acts of violence"" that are undermining hopes for an eventual peaceful settlement to the decadeslong Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the Jordanian government added, reaffirming its support for a two-state solution. Israel's new coalition has vowed to expand Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and even annex the territory, making a future independent Palestinian state unviable.

Jordan’s 1994 treaty normalizing ties with Israel produced a chilly-at-best peace between the former enemies.The Jordanian government has already summoned the Israeli ambassador to Amman twice in the last month since Israel's new government took office — both times after an incident at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound. Netanyahu has repeatedly offered assurances that there has been no change in the status quo at the site.ISRAEL URGES CITIZENS TO 'DOWNPLAY' THEIR ISRAELI IDENTITY AT QATAR WORLD CUP FOR THEIR OWN 'SECURITY'Earlier this month, Israel’s new hard-line minister of national security, Itamar Ben-Gvir, made a provocative visit to the site, drawing condemnations from Jordan and across the Arab world. Jordan also protested to Israel after Israeli police briefly blocked the Jordanian ambassador from entering the Al-Aqsa Mosque, decrying the move as an affront to Jordan's role as custodian.The compound is administered by Jordanian religious authorities as part of an unofficial agreement after Israel captured east Jerusalem, along with the West Bank and Gaza, in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel is in charge of security at the site. Because of Jordan’s special role and the site’s importance to Muslims around the world, whatever happens at the site has regional implications.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe site emerged as a major flashpoint between Israel and the Muslim world in 2017, when Israel placed metal detectors, cameras and other security measures at entrances to the compound in response to a deadly Palestinian attack there.

(AP Photo/Ariel Schalit)But, love him or hate him — and Israelis appear pretty equally divided on this — Netanyahu is fighting vigorously to return to power and, according to the latest polls, there’s a small chance he might just be able to do it this time.""Anyone who gives a yes or no answer on the question of whether Netanyahu can return is someone you should stop listening to. And there’s no better proof than the fact that we're going for a fifth election in three and a half years,"" Reuven Hazan, a professor of political science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, told Fox News Digital in an interview.ISRAELI PM LAPID ISSUES WARNING TO IRAN IN UN SPEECH: ‘WE HAVE CAPABILITIES AND WE ARE NOT AFRAID TO USE THEM'""If we knew in advance exactly where we were going, we would have done that after the first or the second round, definitely the third. We really don’t need five elections, and the reason we are at five is because we don’t know,"" he said. ""Every poll shows that it’s coming down to the wire.""A poll published Friday — among the final polls taken ahead of Election Day — by Israel’s highest-rated news show, Channel 12, shows Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud party receiving 31 seats in Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, and the bloc of parties that have committed to supporting the former prime minister receiving only 60, making him still one seat short of what he needs to form a solid coalition.

Israel is heading into its fifth election in under four years Nov. 1.   (AP Photo/Oded Balilty)The Yesh Atid party, headed by caretaker Prime Minister Yair Lapid, the polls show, will only have 25 seats, and the bloc of parties that might potentially align with him in their opposition to Netanyahu returning to power is only 56. The Joint List, a predominantly Arab party, which is also against Netanyahu’s return, is slated to receive four seats but will not back any government.""In other words, there are 120 members in the Israeli parliament, and in order to form a government because it’s a parliamentary system, not a presidential democracy, as in the U.S., you need a majority of at least 61 seats, and he [Netanyahu] doesn’t have that yet,"" said Hazan. ""In the best of polls, he’s at 60, so it ain’t over till the fat lady sings, and she’s gonna sing on Tuesday night.""AFTER CLAIM THAT POSSIBLE NEW ISRAEL GOV’T WILL DAMAGE RELATIONS WITH US, SEN. MENENDEZ STAYS SILENTWhile most elections worldwide usually hinge on a group of undecided voters who stand somewhere in the middle of the political spectrum, in Israel the vote appears to hinge on those whose views are somewhere on the fringes.On the far right of Israel’s political spectrum lies the Religious Zionism party, a conglomeration of what some claim are extremist, once persona non-grata agitators who have tried to clean up their act to make inroads into Israel’s parliament. They have committed to supporting Netanyahu and Bibi, much to the chagrin of some Western governments and Jewish communities worldwide.  Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israeli far-right lawmaker and leader of the Otzma Yehudit (Jewish power) party, and Bezalel Smotrich, Israeli far-right lawmaker and leader of the Religious Zionist Party, attend a rally with supporters in the southern Israeli city of Sderot Oct. 26, 2022.  (Gil Cohen-Magen/AFP via Getty Images))The party, led by Bezalel Smotrich, a former transport minister in Netanyahu’s previous government, and Itamar Ben-Gvir, a lawyer with a criminal record and a disciple of the American Rabbi and Knesset Member Meir Kahana who was assassinated by a terrorist in New York in 1990, are both bold in their views toward the country’s Arab population and have declared plans to overhaul the country’s judicial system, which they claim is corrupt, biased and far too powerful.Latest polls show them drawing as many as 14 seats in Israel’s parliament, making it the third-largest faction and the potential kingmakers who could bestow Netanyahu the prime ministerial crown.On the far left of Israel’s political map are three Arab parties, which could be an equally decisive factor in whether Netanyahu wins or loses. Previously united, the three factions once formed a significant power bloc in the Knesset, but the endless cycle of elections has left them squabbling and running separately in this round.  A man walks by an election campaign billboard showing Sami Abu Shehadeh, head of the nationalist Balad party, in the northern Israeli city of Umm al-Fahm, Oct. 21, 2022.   (AP Photo/Mahmoud Illean)According to polls, each party hovers on the electoral threshold, and a defeated and dejected Arab public — roughly 20% of Israel’s population — appears more apathetic than ever toward Israel’s politics. The failure of any one of these parties, as well as three additional smaller parties, to receive the requisite 3.25% of the vote could drastically change the outcome of the election.Dr. Gadi Taub, a political commentator and professor of U.S. history at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, told Fox News Digital that Netanyahu definitely ""has an advantage"" this time around, but he emphasized, ""There are still a lot of variables that make it very hard to predict.""WATCH: BIBI 'EYE TO EYE' WITH TRUMP, 'DIVERGED' WITH OBAMA ON PEACE AND POWER, TOUTS 'SHARING VALUES' WITH USThe possibility of smaller parties, including one that is on the right of the political spectrum, falling below the electoral threshold, he said, ""changes the situation not only for the parties, but also for the distribution of votes to other parties"" that can drastically change the outcome.""That said, it looks like Netanyahu has a fair chance, although if he only gets 61 (seats) in his coalition, it will be an unstable government, and many of his voters are hoping that this time around the right wing will not bow its head down before the liberal deep state,"" said Taub, who also writes a column for Israeli daily Haaretz.

(Mostafa Alkharouf/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)In an interview with Fox News Digital, Netanyahu said he was working hard to return to power, and ""I think there’s a very good chance we'll win this time because people have tasted the difference.""""They put in a different government that made an alliance – this will shock you – with the Muslim Brotherhood, and they’re actually part of the existing coalition that was unraveled,"" he said, adding that it is ""unfathomable because these people don't recognize the Jewish state … and I think many in Israel want to see a return to a government that is committed to Israel as a Jewish state, to restoring a powerful economy, a powerful military and security for all Israelis.""Whether Netanyahu will succeed still remains to be seen, but leaders in the U.S. and around the world, as well as many Jewish communities, are watching Israel’s election closely, wondering if the former leader's return to power will also mean empowering inflammatory elements on the far right such as Smotrich and Ben-Gvir.Asked by Fox if he would definitely include their party in a future government, even if it were to put a strain on relations with the Biden administration, which has already aired its concern on the matter, Netanyahu dismissed such fears as ""ridiculous"" and ""hypocrisy.""""I mean, I’ve had parties on my right, including parties of this same persuasion, and they didn't control the policy,"" he said. ""For God’s sake, we’re the biggest party, I’m the prime minister, and we control policy.

An election is likely to take place in late October or early November.A poll taken by Israeli TV’s Channel 12 News immediately following Bennett’s announcement on Wednesday showed Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud party gaining at least 15 seats more than its closest rival and gaining enough support from other right-wing factions and those loyal to the former leader to form a government with a small majority.In a brief televised statement from Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, Bennett said, ""I do not intend to compete in the coming elections but will remain a loyal soldier in the service of this country.""ISRAELI PARLIAMENT'S COALITION CHAIR RESIGNS, OPENING DOOR TO NEW ELECTIONS, BIBI NETANYAHU COMEBACK  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, left, and Defense Minister Naftali Bennett, visit an Israeli army base in the Golan Heights, on the Israeli-Syrian border, Sunday, Nov. 24, 2019. (Atef Safadi/Pool via AP)""The state of Israel is the love of my life,"" said Bennett, who entered into office a year ago heading a broad government coalition made up of eight parties spanning the political spectrum and including for the first time an Arab-Israeli party. Ultimately, it was the clash of ideologies that brought Bennett’s coalition to an end last week. Israel’s parliament is expected to be dissolved on Thursday and be replaced with a caretaker government led by Bennett’s coalition partner, Yair Lapid, who will run the country through what is expected to be a fraught four-month election period. Lapid, a former journalist and media personality, stands apart from other Israeli prime ministers as he does not have a strong military background and did not graduate from high school. Unlike other Israeli prime ministers, Lapid served as a correspondent for an army magazine during his compulsory military service before becoming a newspaper reporter and eventually a regular face on Israeli TV screens, including hosting the nightly news.   Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, right, and Foreign Minister Yair Lapid attend a cabinet meeting at the Prime Minister's office in Jerusalem, June 19, 2022.  (Abir Sultan/Pool Photo via AP, File)However, being in the top office as Israelis head to the polls will put Lapid, who for the past year has served as Foreign Minister and Alternate Prime Minister, in a prime position to showcase his political skills and go head-to-head with his main rival, Netanyahu. NETANYAHU WARNS IRAN COULD ‘TAKE THE ENTIRE WORLD HOSTAGE’ IF WEST APPROVES NEW NUKE DEALAs interim prime minister, Lapid will be the one to meet with President Joe Biden when he makes his first visit as president to Israel next month and might also be the one to work with the White House as it encourages normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia, which the president also intends to visit during his Middle East trip. Biden is also expected to meet with Netanyahu, who formally heads the opposition in Israel’s parliament. The two leaders have a long but temperamental relationship. When Biden visited Israel as vice president in 2010, while Netanyahu was prime minister, an announcement of new settlements in East Jerusalem created a crisis between the two leaders.Since 2019, Israeli leaders, including Netanyahu, have struggled to form a stable coalition government because of the fragmented nature of the country’s parliamentary system, which allows a host of small parties and requires that the government controls a majority of the seats. Bennett struggled over the past three months to keep his coalition together after members of his own faction quit over ideological differences.   FILE PHOTO: U.S. Vice President Joe Biden (L) shakes hands with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as they deliver joint statements during their meeting in Jerusalem March 9, 2016.

""So this deal, which is supposed to stop nuclear weapon weapons in the Middle East and the proliferation of weapons of mass death in this neighborhood and beyond, it will actually cause the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and the Middle East will be crisscrossed by nuclear tripwires.

""If Iran has nuclear weapons, they don't merely threaten my country, Israel or the entire Middle East and America's allies.

President Biden appeared to quickly drop his ""no handshake"" policy during his Middle East tour, leading some to speculate that the White House adopted the policy merely to avoid a politically uncomfortable encounter later in the trip. White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan announced Wednesday that the president would avoid shaking hands during the four-day trip out of an abundance of caution due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The president appeared to abide by the policy when he arrived in Israel, greeting Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid and other officials with fist bumps. But not long after that Biden shook hands with former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu – all while not wearing a facemask or taking COVID-19 precautions of any kind. Biden visited Madrid in June to attend a G7 conference during a time when the city's COVID-19 cases had reached a rolling 7-day average of over 2,000 new cases. During that time, Biden had no problem shaking hands and getting close and personal with a range of leaders from across the globe, including Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan - a man who has been condemned for his country's crackdown on human rights activists, as well as clamping down on press freedom, and the arrest and harassment of journalists.ISRAEL'S BEN GURION AIRPORT WELCOMES BIDEN, AIR FORCE ONE UPON ARRIVALThe handshake with Netanyahu has led some to believe that the White House policy has nothing to do with COVID-19 and everything to do with avoiding a bad press moment with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia.

The apparent flip-flop on his handshake policy will only heighten attention to how the world leaders will greet each other. The White House this week insisted that the trip aimed to ""advance American interests,"" denying that the president had gone to the Middle East to push leaders in OPEC to increase oil production as the world continues to face a fuel crisis. HALEY SAYS BIDEN EFFORTS TO REVIVE IRAN DEAL ‘SLAP IN THE FACE’ TO ISRAEL, ARAB ALLIES""I'm saying it's not, it’s not, it's not the focus,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Monday, adding that it is ""not… on the agenda.""""That’s something for OPEC to decide, clearly.

Israeli extremist Yigal Amir, then 25, assassinated Rabin in the same year.Critics have painted Ben-Gvir as a right-wing extremist for his connections and support of far right-wing elements in Israel, including the late Rabbi Meir Kahane whose ultra-nationalist party was outlawed from running in subsequent elections for inciting racism against Arabs. Kahane was assassinated by a terrorist in Manhattan in 1990.In a recent interview with the Associated Press Shuki Friedman, an expert on Israel’s far right described Ben-Gvir as being ""a populist demagogue … he interviews well, he is good on camera, and he has had plenty of screen time that has given him legitimacy,"" noted Friedman of the Jewish People Policy Institute. ISRAEL, LEBANON INCH CLOSER TO RESOLVE MARITIME DISPUTE AS TERROR GROUP THREATENS OVER DRILLING  Israeli right-wing Knesset member Itamar Ben-Gvir in Jerusalem.

But the truth is that we are anti-racist; we are fighting against the racist antisemitism fomenting within the boundaries of our homeland. We believe that Israel needs to uproot terror organizations such as Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades, just as the United States defeated al Qaeda. Like millions of Americans, we believe that peace comes through strength and that Israel’s policies should be based upon the firm enforcement of our right to sovereignty and self-defense.""In response to the warnings from Menendez, Netanyahu said at a press conference last week in Tel Aviv, ""I would have expected them to warn us of a government that depends on the Muslim Brotherhood who support terrorism and Ahmad Tibi and Ayman Odeh. Odeh said that [Hassan] Nasrallah (Hezbollah) is a hero, after that is it any wonder that Lapid ran to sell him the gas of the citizens of Israel?""Netanyahu was referring to Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid who is the midst of working through a controversial gas deal with Lebanon. Ahmed Tibi and Ayman Odeh are Israeli Arab politicians.A spokesperson for Menendez declined to comment in response to a Fox News Digital press query. The U.S. State Department did not answer a media query.However, Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., who is considered pro-Israel, tweeted, ""As Israel heads toward another election in November, I urge Israeli political leaders from all sides of the political spectrum to ostracize extremists like Ben-Gvir whose outrageous views run contrary to Israel’s core principles of a democratic and Jewish state.""While supporters of Ben-Gvir claim he has reformed his ways, his appeal has not spilled over into the center of Israeli politics, according to professor Tamar Hermann, a senior researcher for the Israeli Democracy Institute. ""He [Ben-Gvir] is still a pariah in the center [and] on the left."" Hermann also noted that he was legitimized by Netanyahu and other politicians on the right.

(Amir Levy/Getty Images) Hermann said Netanyahu helped to mainstream Ben-Gvir during the last election by pushing the idea that ""this man can become a member of the Knesset,"" and this legitimization by the former prime minister was ""critical in the eyes of all people who vote."" ""Ben-Gvir is not at the far end of Israeli politics because of the radicalization that has happened"" after May 2021, said Hermann.During May 2021, Hamas terrorists launched rockets into the Jewish state while Arabs rioted in Israeli cities, which included arson attacks on synagogues. According to Hermann, the events of May 2021 sparked a radicalization among Israeli Arabs and Israeli Jews.RIOTS ERUPT IN PARTS OF ISRAEL AS TENSIONS FLAREBen-Gvir has significant support among the ultra-orthodox, mainly Sephardi voters, who are ""very enthusiastic"" about his message that ""appeals to chauvinistic views of Jews in the state of Israel,"" said Hermann. ""They are looking for a strong leader.""In late August polls from Israel's three major TV networks revealed that Ben-Gvir's party could secure between eight and nine seats in Israel's parliament if elections were conducted straight away. The dramatic rise of Ben-Gvir in the election process has not rolled back since the August poll, according to Israeli public opinion experts like Hermann.Bezalel Smotrich, the chief of the Religious Zionist Party, which formed a voting block with Ben-Gvir, told the Israeli media that Ben-Gvir has positioned himself to be a senior minister in the next government.""I hope we will be the third-largest party in the state of Israel,"" said Smotrich.

Everybody understands the challenges of jihadism and erosion of national identity. That is what Ben-Gvir represents, and the people of Israel think that way.""CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPFleisher said Menendez’s concerns are not justified: ""Moreover, it does not feel quite right that there is this air of meddling.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government on Tuesday for the first time advanced a plan to overhaul the country’s legal system, defying a mass uproar among Israelis and calls for restraint from the United States.The vote marked only preliminary approval for the plan. But it raised the stakes in a political battle that drew tens of thousands of protesters into the streets, sparked criticism from influential sectors of society and widened the rifts in an already polarized country.The 63-47 vote after midnight gave initial approval to a plan that would give Netanyahu’s coalition more power over who becomes a judge. It is part of a broader package of changes that seeks to weaken the country’s Supreme Court and transfer more power to the ruling coalition.ISRAELI PROTESTERS TAKE TO STREETS TO BLAST NETANYAHU 'JUDICIAL REFORMS' AS PM CALLS FOR UNITYNetanyahu’s ultrareligious and ultranationalist allies say these changes are needed to rein in the powers of an unelected judiciary. Critics fear that judges will be appointed based on their loyalty to the government or prime minister — and say that Netanyahu, who faces trial on corruption charges, has a conflict of interest in the legislation.The showdown has plunged Israel into one of its most bitter domestic crises, with both sides insisting that the future of democracy is at stake in their Middle Eastern country. Israeli Palestinians, a minority that may have the most to lose by the overhaul, have mostly stayed on the sidelines, due to discrimination they face at home and Israel’s ongoing 55-year occupation of their Palestinian brethren in the West Bank.The legislators cast their votes after a vitrolic debate that dragged on past midnight. During the session, opposition lawmakers chanted, ""shame,"" and wrapped themselves in the Israeli flag — and some were ejected from the hall.Thousands were rallying outside the Knesset, waving Israeli flags and holding signs reading ""saving democracy!"" Earlier in the day, protesters launched a sit-down demonstration at the entrance of the homes of some coalition lawmakers and briefly halted traffic on Tel Aviv’s main highway.Netanyahu accused the demonstrators of violence and said they were ignoring the will of the people who voted his coalition into power last November.""The people exercised their right to vote in the elections and the people’s representatives will exercise their right to vote here in Israel’s Knesset. It’s called democracy,"" Netanyahu said, though he left the door open for dialogue on the planned changes.  Despite protests, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government is pushing forward with a judicial overhaul. (AP Photo/Ohad Zwigenberg)The vote on part of the legislation is just the first of three readings required for parliamentary approval, a process that is expected to take months.Nonetheless, the opposition, including tens of thousands of protesters in front of the Knesset in Jerusalem and in Tel Aviv, saw Monday’s vote as the coalition’s determination to barrel ahead.""We are fighting for our children’s future, for our country’s future. We don’t intend to give up,"" said opposition leader Yair Lapid.Israel’s figurehead president has urged the government to freeze the legislation and seek a compromise with the opposition, a position supported by most polls.Leaders in the booming tech sector have warned that weakening the judiciary could drive away investors.The overhaul has prompted otherwise stoic former security chiefs to speak out, and even warn of civil war. The plan has even sparked rare warnings from the U.S., Israel’s chief international ally.U.S. Ambassador Tom Nides told a podcast over the weekend that Israel should ""pump the brakes"" on the legislation and seek a consensus on reform that would protect Israel’s democratic institutions.His comments drew angry responses from Netanyahu allies, telling Nides to stay out of Israel’s internal affairs.The debate raged Monday from the floor of the Knesset to flag-waving demonstrations in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.Simcha Rothman, a far-right lawmaker leading the legislative initiative, presented the proposal to the parliament. Overhead in the viewing gallery, a spectator banged on the protective glass and was carried away by guards.A fellow Religious Zionism party politician posted a photo on Twitter with Rothman ahead of the vote, celebrating with whisky and sushi.Last week, some 100,000 people demonstrated outside the Knesset as a committee granted initial approval to the plan. On Monday, the crowds returned, waved Israeli flags, blew horns, and held signs reading ""saving democracy.""""All the steps that are going to take place now in the Knesset will change us to a pure dictatorship,"" said Itan Gur Aryeh, a 74-year-old retiree. ""All the power will be with the government, with the head of the government and we’ll all be without rights.""Earlier in the day, protesters launched a sit-down demonstration at the entrance of the homes of some coalition lawmakers and briefly halted traffic on Tel Aviv’s main highway. Hundreds waved Israeli flags in the seaside city and further up the coast in Haifa, holding signs reading ""resistance is mandatory.""UN RIPS ISRAEL OVER WEST BANK SETTLEMENT CONSTRUCTIONWhile Israel has long boasted of its democratic credentials, critics say that claim is tainted by the country’s West Bank occupation and the treatment of its own Palestinian minority.Israel’s Palestinian citizens, who make up about 20% of the population, have the right to vote but continue to suffer discrimination in areas like the job and housing markets. In the West Bank, Jewish settlers can vote in Israeli elections and are generally protected by Israeli laws, while Palestinians in the same territory are subject to military rule and cannot vote.The parliamentary votes seek to grant the ruling coalition more power over who becomes a judge. Today, a selection committee is made up of politicians, judges and lawyers — a system that proponents say promotes consensus.The new system would give coalition lawmakers control over the appointments. Critics fear that judges will be appointed based on their loyalty to the government or prime minister.A second change approved Monday would bar the Supreme Court from overturning what are known as ""Basic Laws,"" pieces of legislation that stand in for a constitution, which Israel does not have. Critics say that legislators will be able to dub any law a Basic Law, removing judicial oversight over controversial legislation.Also planned are proposals that would give parliament the power to overturn Supreme Court rulings and control the appointment of government legal advisers. The advisers currently are professional civil servants, and critics say the new system would politicize government ministries.Critics also fear the overhaul will grant Netanyahu an escape route from his legal woes. Netanyahu has been on trial for nearly three years for charges of accepting bribes, fraud and breach of trust. He denies wrongdoing and says he is the victim of a biased judicial system on a witch hunt against him.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIsrael’s attorney general has barred Netanyahu from any involvement in the overhaul, saying his legal troubles create a conflict of interest. Instead, his justice minister, a close confidant, is leading the charge.On Sunday, Netanyahu called the restrictions on him ""patently ridiculous.""  ",2021-03-08 02:33:00

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.Israel’s parliament voted Thursday to dissolve itself, marking the end of a year-old experimental coalition government, and sending the country to the polls in November for the fifth time in less than four years.Yair Lapid, Israel’s foreign minister and architect of the outgoing coalition government, will become the country’s caretaker prime minister just after midnight on Friday. He will be the 14th person to hold that office, taking over from Naftali Bennett, Israel's shortest serving prime minister.Following the vote, Lapid embraced Bennett before the two swapped chairs. He posted, ""thanks, Naftali, my brother"" on Twitter.The government collapsed just over a year after it was formed in a historic move that saw longtime leader Benjamin Netanyahu ousted after 12 years in power by a coalition of ideologically diverse parties, the first to include an Arab faction.ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENNETT ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT FROM POLITICS, PAVING THE WAY FOR NETANYAHU’S RETURNThe motion to dissolve passed with 92 lawmakers in favor, and none against, after days of bickering by coalition and opposition lawmakers over the date of new elections and other last-minute legislation.New elections will be held on Nov. 1.The move brings a formal end to a political experiment in which eight parties from across the Israeli spectrum tried to find common ground after a period of prolonged gridlock in which the country held four elections in two years.

Israel's parliament has voted to dissolve itself, sending the country to the polls for the fifth time in less than four years.  ((AP Photo/Ariel Schalit))The upcoming elections are an extension of Israel’s protracted political crisis, at the heart of which sits Netanyahu and his ongoing corruption trial. The four deadlocked elections in the previous three years were largely referendums on Netanyahu’s fitness to serve while facing charges of accepting bribes, fraud and breach of trust. Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing.Lapid, a former talk-show host who heads a center-left party, is expected to campaign as caretaker prime minister to keep the job as the main alternative to Netanyahu, and will likely get an early boost when he welcomes President Joe Biden to the country next week.ISRAEL CALLS FOR NEW ELECTIONS ONE MONTH BEFORE BIDEN VISITPolls by Israeli media show Netanyahu and his allies are projected to gain seats, although it is unclear whether they would have enough to form a 61-seat majority in the 120-member Knesset. If neither he nor anyone else succeeds in doing so, Israel could go to elections yet again.On Wednesday, Bennett said he would be taking a hiatus from politics and would not be running in the upcoming elections. His Yamina party was riven by infighting and splintered following the formation of the government last year as its members broke away in protest of what they considered Bennett’s excessive compromises to more liberal coalition allies.

In the Palestinian territories, it's illegal to sell land to Jews or Israelis, with punishments ranging from hard labor to prison to execution.Friedman went on to quote a past column of his arguing Netanyahu was able to address Congress in the past because he was ""bought and paid for by AIPAC."" The exact wording of the 2011 article was that the standing ovation the prime minister got in Congress was ""bought and paid for by the Israel lobby"" — a statement for which he received significant backlash.Friedman's remarks seem to echo those of Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), who in 2019 came under fire for accusing American politicians of supporting the Jewish state because of the ""Benjamins,"" a slang term for money. When asked who's paying U.S. leaders to be pro-Israel, she responded, ""AIPAC."" Omar later apologized but still called AIPAC ""problematic."" She then praised a Democratic activist while retweeting a thread in which he said AIPAC's lobbying is ""about the Benjamins.""The New York Times writer then said that if Netanyahu ""wanted to speak tomorrow"" at the University of Wisconsin, ""they'd have to bring out the National Guard,"" arguing the prime minister couldn't address the campus due to large-scale opposition.""Shame on him,"" added Friedman.

University officials called the graffiti antisemitic.Friedman and the American Jewish Committee did not respond to Fox News Digital's requests for comment. However, AIPAC provided a statement.""Across many different governments and administrations in both countries, we have consistently worked to strengthen the U.S.-Israel relationship, which is entirely aligned with American values and interests,"" an AIPAC spokesperson told Fox News Digital. ""As Israel confronts threats from an Iranian regime that has accelerated its efforts to obtain a nuclear weapon and bolstered its alliance with Russia, we will continue our efforts to help ensure the Jewish state has the resources to defend itself.""Friedman's comments weren't the first time that the New York Times has appeared critical of Israel and Netanyahu. In 2019, for example, the Times' international edition published a cartoon of a guide dog with a big nose and the face of Netanyahu leading a blind Donald Trump wearing a yarmulke. The dog had a Star of David hanging from its collar.  The New York Times called Musk’s decision ""questionable and unfortunate,"" and called for a thorough explanation.  (REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton/File Photo)FORMER NEW YORK TIMES EDITOR BASHES PAPER FOR PRESENCE AT DAVOS: 'CORRUPT CIRCLE-JERK'""The cartoon gave vivid expression to the conspiracy theory, or rather myth, that is at the heart of antisemitism and did so in an image that, as was widely noted, could have appeared in Der Stürmer,"" an old German tabloid that was part of Nazi propaganda, wrote Deborah Lipstadt, who currently serves as President Biden's special envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism.After receiving significant backlash for publishing the cartoon, the Times released an editor's note calling the image, which was then deleted, ""offensive,"" adding that it was ""an error of judgment to publish it."" When the criticism didn't stop, the paper's opinion section issued an apology and acknowledged that the cartoon was antisemitic. The Times explained that a ""single editor working without adequate oversight"" downloaded the cartoon and decided to run it.Times columnist Bret Stephens wrote in the paper amid the controversy that, for some readers, the paper ""has a longstanding Jewish problem, dating back to World War II, when it mostly buried news about the Holocaust, and continuing into the present day in the form of intensely adversarial coverage of Israel.""CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPLipstadt echoed those sentiments later that year.""Not only were Israeli victims repeatedly ignored, but the Times' reporters and columnists seem to consistently bend over backward to explain away Palestinian wrongs and find moderation among the perpetrators,"" she wrote.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.Israel has told the Biden administration it will rein in the approval of new West Bank settlement outposts, the prime minister's office said Monday, a day after a potential diplomatic crisis was averted at the United Nations over Israeli-Palestinian tensions.The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would not greenlight any new wildcat settlements in the West Bank beyond nine such outposts built without authorization that it approved retroactively earlier this month. The statement, however, made no mention of the thousands of additional settlement homes in existing settlements officials say are to be soon approved.A contentious U.N. Security Council resolution pushed by the Palestinians and their supporters slated for Monday would have condemned Israel for settlement expansion and demanded a halt to future activity. According to multiple diplomats, the Biden administration managed to forestall the vote by convincing both Israel and the Palestinians to agree in principle to a six-month freeze in any unilateral action they might take.ISRAELI OFFICIALS DOUBLE DOWN ON SETTLEMENT CONSTRUCTION, REBUKE US CRITICISM""Israel notified the U.S. that in the coming months it will not authorize new settlements beyond the nine that have already been approved,"" Netanyahu's office said.The Security Council unanimously approved the watered-down statement Monday.

These outposts, which sometimes are little more than a handful of trailer homes but can also resemble small villages, are built without authorization but are often tolerated and even encouraged by Israeli governments. The international community considers all Israeli construction on occupied land to be illegitimate or illegal.The U.N. vote presented a headache for the Biden administration at a time when it is focusing its diplomatic efforts on Russia's war with Ukraine, which is coming up on one year this week.

Construction in established settlements is expected to continue, as it has under successive Israeli governments.Netanyahu's office also said it would continue to demolish illegally built Palestinian homes in the 60% of the West Bank that is under full Israeli control.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.Israel’s prime minister said Tuesday that the country has reached a ""historic agreement"" with neighboring Lebanon over their shared maritime border after months of U.S.-brokered negotiations.The agreement, coming after several years of U.S.-mediated talks, would mark a major breakthrough in relations with the two countries, which formally have been at war since Israel's establishment in 1948. But the deal still faces some obstacles, including key legal and political challenges in Israel. There was no immediate confirmation by Lebanon that a deal had been reached.At stake are rights over exploiting undersea natural gas reserves in areas of the eastern Mediterranean that the two countries — which do not have diplomatic relations — claim.Premier Yair Lapid called the deal an ""historic achievement that will strengthen Israel’s security, inject billions into Israel’s economy, and ensure the stability of our northern border.""   In this photo released by Lebanon's official government photographer Dalati Nohra, Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Makati, right, receives the final draft of the maritime border agreement between Lebanon and Israel from his deputy Elias Bou Saab who leads the Lebanese negotiating team, in Beirut, Lebanon, Tuesday, Oct. 11, 2022.

Lebanon hopes gas exploration will help lift its country out of its spiraling economic crisis.Lebanon and Israel both claim some 860 square kilometers (330 square miles) of the Mediterranean Sea. Under the agreement, those waters would be divided along a line straddling a strategic natural gas field.According to a senior Israeli official, Lebanon would be allowed to produce gas from that field, called ""Qana,"" but pay royalties to Israel for any gas produced from the Israeli side. Lebanon has been working with the French energy giant Total on preparations for exploring the field.The agreement would also leave in place an existing ""buoy line"" that serves as a de facto border between the two countries, the official said. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was discussing behind-the-scenes negotiations.ISRAEL CLEARS ITSELF IN 7-YEAR-OLD PALESTINIAN BOY'S DEATHMany leading security figures, both active and retired, have hailed the deal because it could lower tensions with Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group, which has repeatedly threatened to strike Israeli natural gas assets in the Mediterranean.With Lebanon now having a stake in the region's natural gas industry, experts believe the sides will think twice before opening up another war.The two sides fought a monthlong war in 2006, and Israel considers the heavily armed Hezbollah to be its most immediate military threat.""It might help create and strengthen the mutual deterrence between Israel and Hezbollah,"" said Yoel Guzansky, a senior fellow at Israel's Institute for National Security Studies. ""This is a very positive thing for Israel.""The final draft of the agreement will be brought before Israel’s caretaker government for approval this week ahead of the Nov. 1 election, when the country goes to the polls for the fifth time in under four years.

Former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has said the caretaker government has no authority to sign such an important agreement and has vowed to cancel the deal if re-elected. On Tuesday, he accused Lapid of caving in to Hezbollah threats.""This is not a historic agreement.

It is now reported that the U.N. Security Council will meet later this week in New York to discuss the visit.The area is also the third most important site in Islam, the Al-Aqsa Mosque, which is also located on the Temple Mount—the Jewish name for the compound—in the Old City of Jerusalem. The Temple Mount is where both temples stood in Jerusalem before they were destroyed by invading armies.Israel’s new right-of-center coalition government entered office last week. Since Israel captured the Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem during the 1967 Six-Day War, Israeli governments have permitted the Jordanian religious institution, the Waqf, to manage the Temple Mount and Al-Aqsa Mosque. Jews and Christians are largely not permitted to pray on the Temple Mount, and there are severe restrictions for non-Muslim visitors to enter the compound. The controversial firebrand Ben-Gvir tweeted a picture of himself on the Temple Mount with security officials, writing, ""The Israeli government of which I am a member will not surrender to a vile organization of murderers. The Temple Mount is open to all and if Hamas thinks that if it threatens me, that will deter me, they had better understand that times have changed. There is a government in Jerusalem.""   The Temple Mount and the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. (iStock)BENJAMIN NETANYAHU RETURNS TO POWER IN ISRAEL AS NEW GOVERNMENT IS SWORN IN Israel has declared all of Jerusalem its indivisible capital. Palestinians want East Jerusalem, where the Temple Mount is situated, as their capital of an independent a state along with the absorption of the disputed West Bank territory. The Temple Mount is the most significant holy site for Jews because two ancient temples were located on the compound and later destroyed. The Babylonians destroyed the First Temple in 586 B.C., and the Romans annihilated the Second Temple in year 70.  A section of the Second Temple—the Western Wall—is still standing.According to Jewish tradition, the 3,000-year-old Temple Mount is the location where God collected dust to create Adam—the first human being. The Temple Mount is also holy for Jews because it is the location where Abraham almost sacrificed his son Isaac to affirm his faith. The Jewish King Solomon built the First Temple of the Jews at the site. Muslims also term the Temple Mount the Haram al-Sharif, the Noble Sanctuary, where the Al-Aqsa Mosque and Dome of the Rock are located. The founder of Islam, Prophet Muhammed is, according to tradition, said to have ascended to heaven from the Noble Sanctuary.  Muslim worshipers fill the grounds outside the Al-Aqsa mosque on the last Friday of Ramadan, Dec. 31. About 400,000 Muslims packed Islam's thrid holiest shrine during this holy month of fasting and prayer. (Reuters)For Christians, the site is very significant as it was where Jesus would have been as a young boy, where he attended festivals, and he is also said to have taught there. Additionally, it's believed that Jesus foretold the destruction of the temple while there.   Rev. Dr. Petra Heltd, a leading Christian scholar, told Fox News Digital that ""The significance of the Temple Mount cannot be overstated in the Christian world. We can go back to the New Testament where Jesus prayed and got his Brit Milah (circumcision) and then his Barmitzvah.""She added, ""The disciples constantly went to the Temple Mount to pray. We have the story of Peter who healed sick people on the Temple Mount. And where the disciples and many people received the Holy Spirit on the Temple Mount. This constitutes the beginning of the Church. The Church writings are full of importance of the Temple Mount.""BIBLICAL SITE WHERE JESUS HEALED BLIND MAN EXCAVATED FOR PUBLIC VIEW: 'AFFIRMS SCRIPTURE'Heltd continued, ""It is a very deep and intimate connection for Christians to the temple. The churches in the Middle East still commemorate each year of the circumcision of Jesus on the first of January and the Barmitzvah and the healing of the sick by Peter.""

(AP Photo/Oded Balilty)The Temple Mount has long been a flashpoint for tension. When as opposition leader the former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon visited the compound in 2000, the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat used his visit as a pretext to launch a new war of terrorism against the Jewish state called the Second Intifada, according to Israeli security experts. U.S. criticism of the visit came from U.S. Ambassador to Israel Thomas Nides, who said that the U.S. ""has been very clear in conversations with the Israeli government on the issue of preserving the status quo,"" in a statement.       Ned Price, the U.S. State Department spokesman, told reporters, ""The United States stands firmly for preservation of the historic status quo with respect to the holy sites in Jerusalem. We oppose any unilateral actions that undercut the historic status quo. They are unacceptable. The President has previously underscored the need to preserve that historic status quo at the Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount, as has the Secretary."" Egypt’s Foreign Ministry expressed a warning about ""the negative repercussions of such measures on security and stability in the occupied territories and the region, and on the future of the peace process."" Turkey termed Ben-Gvir’s visit as being ""provocative,"" while the Palestinian Authority (PA) also condemned the visit as an ""unprecedented provocation."" The PA added that ""Netanyahu bears responsibility for this attack on Al-Aqsa.""   Former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon touches the stones of the Western Wall, also known as the Wailing Wall, as he prays while visiting the Old City Feb, 7, 2001, the morning after being elected as Israel's 39th next prime minister. Sharon as opposition leader visited the Temple Mount which led to violence among Palestinians and Israelis. (Reuters)UN ACCUSED BY ISRAELI GROUP OF FLOUTING INTERNATIONAL LAW BY FUNDING CONSTRUCTION IN ISRAELI-CONTROLLED AREAS Additional Sunni Muslim countries, with which Israel has diplomatic relations, condemned Ben-Gvir’s visit. The United Arab Emirates rebuked Ben-Gvir for his ""storming of the Al-Aqsa Mosque courtyard"" and urged an end to the ""serious and provocative violations."" Jordan blasted ""in the severest terms the storming of the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the violation of its sanctity."" The Jordanian Foreign Ministry in Amman summoned the Israeli ambassador Eitan Sorkis, who got a dressing down from the Hashemite Kingdom. It is unclear what Jordan meant by the ""storming"" of the Al-Aqsa Mosque. Ben-Gvir did not enter the mosque and his presence on the compound went without friction.  HOLY LAND FIGHT: ISRAELI LAWMAKERS CONDEMN EU'S 'ILLEGAL' ACTIONS ON BIBLICAL LAND Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the associate dean of the Los Angeles-based Jewish human rights organization, the Simon Wiesenthal Center, told Fox News Digital that Jordan is, ""The last country on earth to lecture Israel. Jordan destroyed Jewish life in the Old City in 1948."" Jordan controlled the Old City in Jerusalem from 1948 until 1967. Cooper noted that Jordan ""barred Jews for 19 years from praying at the Western Wall"" and ""it is the height of hypocrisy,"" for Jordan to lash out at Israel.   An Israeli flag flying over Jerusalem with the Temple Mount and Al-Aqsa Mosque in the distance.

This is the 27th annual such meeting. It is attended by nearly 200 countries and a regional economic integration organization that are members of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, also known as the UNFCCC.Why is it called COP?The acronym COP stands for ""Conference of the Parties."" According to the UNFCCC, the COP is the decision-making body that is responsible for ""monitoring and reviewing"" the implantation of the convention.What happens at COP?This summit is meant to foster cooperation between the member nations to address climate change on a global scale. Leaders and their designates will meet to discuss their plans. It also allows them to refine those plans or develop new ones.Go to unfccc.int for a schedule of events for COP27.   03:22 Climate compensation, adaptation on this year's agenda at COP27 Dr. Steve Cohen, Senior Vice Dean for the School of Professional Studies at Columbia University, discusses COP27, which is underway in Egypt. Who is the US sending to COP27?President Joe Biden is scheduled to attend COP27 on Nov. 11, but a delegation of U.S. officials is being led to the conference by Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry. Among the high-level officials in the U.S. delegation is Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and Rick Spinrad, administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.HOW TO WATCH FOX WEATHER   02:19 Biden recaps climate change efforts at COP26 President Joe Biden recapped the efforts to address climate change that have been made during his two days at COP26.Who else is going to COP27?Since Egypt is hosting COP27, it’s no surprise that high-level officials of the Egyptian government will be in attendance.United Kingdom Prime Minister Rishi Sunak originally said after his recent appointment that he would skip COP27, but reversed course in the days leading up to the conference.""There is no long-term prosperity without action on climate change,"" Sunak said in a tweet. Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid reportedly pulled out of the conference amid an election that saw former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reelected.

During COP21, the Paris Agreement was adopted by the 196 member nations. The treaty seeks to limit global temperature increases to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) compared to pre-industrial levels.At COP26, some delegates said they felt the climate deal agreed to during the conference didn’t go far enough to clamp down on the drivers of climate change.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.An Israeli lawmaker is planning to introduce legislation to annex the Jordan Valley, an eastern strip of the West Bank that is home to roughly 30 Jewish settlements.Knesset Member Amb. Danny Danon is looking to propose the bill, which would make the area, which runs along the Jordan River from the Sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea, part of Israel proper. The region is part of what is known as Area C of the West Bank, which means it is already under Israeli control, but its residents live under Israeli military law. As it is not currently an official part of Israel, Israeli criminal law and some civil laws have only applied to its residents under an emergency measure that had to be renewed every five years since Israel took control of the West Bank in 1967. That measure expired in June 2022 but was eventually renewed on Tuesday. Danon’s bill would make it so that this would no longer have to be done.""All aspects of the sovereignty of the State of Israel will apply to all areas of Israeli settlements in the Jordan Valley, including the industrial areas that serve them, the archaeological sites in the area and the access roads to these areas,"" says a draft of the bill obtained by Fox News Digital.‘PAY TO SLAY’: BIDEN SUED FOR SENDING HALF A BILLION IN PALESTINIAN AID THAT COULD FUND ACTS OF TERRORISM  Danny Danon speaks to journalists on the Downing of the Syrian Airplane at the UN Headquarters in New York City, New York, July 24, 2018. (Photo by EuropaNewswire/Gado/Getty Images) (EuropaNewswire/Gado/Getty Images)The bill applies to the areas covered by the Jordan Valley Regional Council (which includes 22 settlements), the Dead Sea Scrolls Regional Council (seven settlements), and the Ma'ale Ephraim Local Council (one settlement), as well as ten communities located near the valley. Those communities are Kochav HaShahar, Rimonim, Ma'ale Machmesh, Mitzpe Hagit, Neve Erez, Nofei Prat, Anatot, Kfar Adumim, Mitzpe Jericho, and Migdalim.""The Jordan Valley is of great importance to the State of Israel - historically, security-wise and economically,"" an explanatory note for the bill says, noting that its location -- situated between Jordan and Palestinian-controlled areas of the West Bank – make it ""Israel's eastern security belt."" Its annexation was first proposed in a plan the by then-Minister of Labor Yigal Alon after the 1967 Six Day War during which Israel took control of the West Bank. ISRAELI AMBASSADOR SLAMS UN FOR MEETING OVER VISIT TO TEMPLE MOUNT  A view shows the Jordan Valley in the West Bank February 11, 2020. (REUTERS/Ammar Awad) (Reuters)The bill is sure to anger the Palestinians and their leadership, as an annexation under the bill would be a unilateral move taken without any existing agreement between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Fox News reached out to Danon's office regarding this, but he was not available at the time.The official designation of the West Bank territories of Judea and Samaria as being parts of Areas A, B, and C – each with its own level of Israeli or Palestinian control – came about from 1995's Oslo II Accords, which at the time was meant as a temporary measure until a final two-state agreement could be reached.

(AP Photo/Ariel Schalit)On Tuesday, some of Europe's top diplomats joined the U.S. in censuring Israel over its plans to build 10,000 new homes in existing settlements in the West Bank and retroactively legalize nine outposts. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Cabinet announced the measure on Sunday, following a surge in violence in Jerusalem.We ""are deeply troubled by the Israeli government's announcement,"" read the joint statement from the foreign ministers of France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and the U.S. ""We strongly oppose these unilateral actions which will only serve to exacerbate tensions between Israelis and Palestinians.""Israel's Arab neighbors Jordan and Egypt, as well as Saudi Arabia and Norway, similarly expressed grave concern and strong opposition to the new settlement plans.Still, there was no mention of potential consequences. Despite years of accumulated frustration and escalating rhetoric over Israel's fast-expanding settlements that threaten the realization of the two-state solution that has been a goal of the peace process for years, the U.S. and European Union have avoided taking serious action.ISRAELI PROTESTERS TAKE TO STREETS TO BLAST NETANYAHU 'JUDICIAL REFORMS' AS PM CALLS FOR UNITYIsrael's new government could nonetheless test the country's closest ties. In a contentious coalition deal, Netanyahu promised Smotrich authority over the defense body responsible for planning for both settlements and Palestinian construction in parts of the West Bank where Israel maintains civilian control.Once he receives those powers, Smotrich has vowed to ""normalize"" life for more than 500,000 Israeli settlers in the West Bank, erasing the differences between living in a settlement and within Israel’s internationally recognized border and effectively annexing West Bank territory. Such a move would draw widespread backlash.Israel captured the West Bank, along with east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, in the 1967 Mideast war. Most of the international community considers Israeli settlements illegal and an obstacle to peace. Some 700,000 Israeli settlers live in the West Bank and Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPUltranationalists who oppose Palestinian statehood comprise a majority of Israel’s new government, which has declared settlement construction a top priority.
