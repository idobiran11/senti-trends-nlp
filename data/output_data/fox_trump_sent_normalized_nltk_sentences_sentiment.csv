""USA demands the truth!""The president’s tweets come after he pressured his vice president for the last several days, saying he had the power to decertify the results of the 2020 presidential election.PENCE, UNDER PRESSURE FROM TRUMP, SAYS HE DOES NOT HAVE 'UNILATERAL' AUTHORITY TO ACCEPT, REJECT ELECTORAL VOTESPence, who is presiding over a joint session of Congress Wednesday to certify the Electoral College, said just before the session began that, despite the pressure from the president, he does not believe that he ""unilaterally"" has the ability to accept or reject electoral votes.In a letter to members of Congress ahead of Wednesday’s joint session to certify the results of the presidential election and the Electoral College, where he will serve as the presiding officer, Pence said he shares the ""concerns of millions of Americans about the integrity of this election.""""The American people choose the American President, and have every right under the law to demand free and fair elections and a full investigation of electoral misconduct,"" Trump said. ""As presiding officer, I will do my duty to ensure that these concerns receive a fair and open hearing in the Congress of the United States.""He added: ""Objections will be heard, evidence will be presented, and the elected representatives of the American people will make their decision.""Pence acknowledged that ""some believe that as Vice President, I should be able to accept or reject electoral votes unilaterally.""""Others believe that electoral votes should never be challenged in a Joint Session of Congress,"" Pence wrote. ""After a careful study of our Constitution, our laws, and our history, I believe neither view is correct. Video""The President is the chief executive officer of the Federal Government under our Constitution, possessing immense power to impact the lives of the American people,"" Pence wrote. ""The Presidency belongs to the American people, and to them alone.""Pence went on to say that ""when disputes concerning a presidential election arise, under Federal law, it is the people’s representatives who review the evidence and resolve disputes through a democratic process.""But Pence said that it is his ""considered judgment that my oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not.""Pence added that he will do his ""duty to see to it that we open the certificates of the Electors of the several states, we hear objections raised by Senators and Representatives, and we count the votes of the Electoral College for President and Vice President in a manner consistent with our Constitution, laws and history.""Pence sent the letter to Congress as the president addressed thousands of supporters during a pro-Trump rally in Washington D.C. on the sidelines of the joint session of Congress to certify the results of the presidential election.During his remarks, the president said he will ""never give up"" and ""never concede,"" and renewed pressure on Pence to ""do the right thing"" and decertify the election results, warning that he is ""going to be very disappointed in you"" if he does not.TRUMP SAYS HE WILL 'NEVER CONCEDE,' PRESSURES PENCE TO SEND ELECTION 'BACK TO THE STATES'""If Mike Pence does the right thing, we win the election,"" Trump said. ""All he has to do, this is from the number 1, or certainly, one of the top constitutional lawyers in our country, he has the absolute right to do it.""We are supposed to protect our country and support our Constitution,"" Pence said. ""States want to re-vote. The states got defrauded, they were given false information and now they want it back.""He added: ""All Pence has to do is send it back to the states…and we become president, and you are the happiest people.""Trump said that Pence acting ""doesn’t take courage,"" but ""what takes courage is to do nothing.""""And then we’re stuck with a president who lost the election by a lot, and we have to live with that for the next four years,"" Trump said, referring to his Democratic rival Joe Biden. ""We’re not going to let that happen."" VideoThe president, in recent hours, has increasingly put pressure on Pence to intervene during the joint session, tweeting early Wednesday: ""Do it Mike, this is a time for extreme courage!""The president has insisted that ""states want to correct their votes, which they now know were based on irregularities and fraud,"" adding that the ""corrupt process never received legislative approval.""""All Mike Pence has to do is send them back to the States, AND WE WIN,"" Trump tweeted.The president, hours before, tweeted that if Pence ""comes through for us, we will win the presidency.""""Many states want to decertify the mistake they made in certifying incorrect & even fraudulent numbers in a process NOT approved by their State Legislatures (which it must be.)"" VideoThe president has said that he and Pence ""are in total agreement that the Vice President has the power to act,"" and has claimed that the election ""was illegal.""Trump went on to say that Pence has ""several options under the U.S. Constitution.""""He can decertify the results or send them back to the states for change and certification,"" Trump said. ""He can also decertify the illegal and corrupt results and send them to the House of Representatives for the one vote for one state tabulation.""A spokesman for Pence declined to comment on the president’s latest tweets, but White House officials told Fox News on Tuesday that Pence will ""follow the law,"" saying that Pence is ""taking a very diligent and studious approach to his job tomorrow."" ""He has consulted at length with staff. He has gone through the Electoral Count Act several times,"" an official said. ""He has read legal opinions, met with the Senate parliamentarian and consulted with outside experts on the subject matter.""But those officials add that ""the vice president will follow the law,"" and that he will act ""with fidelity to the law and the Constitution.""The president’s remarks also come just hours after the Georgia Senate runoffs, where Democrats are projected to pick up one—and possibly two—seats, which would hand them the majority in the U.S. Senate.The president went on to say that the Democrats ""used the pandemic as a way of defrauding the people in a proper election.""

The expenditures reported were based on actual monies spent, and the reporting methodology was reviewed and endorsed by those with expertise in the state regulatory scheme. Notably, there was no evidence that any of the individuals were motivated by greed. And in fact, the sentencing judge called the likelihood that there was any personal financial motivation ""infinitesimal."" The judge imposed a range of sentences from probation to 3 years’ imprisonment, reflecting the conduct as an aberration from these individuals’ otherwise law-abiding lives. Messrs. Farha, Bereday, Kale, Behrens, and Clay are described as devoted to their family and their communities, and have weathered their convictions without complaint. David Rowland – President Trump granted a full pardon to David Rowland.

That's more in a single term than any other president in one term except for Jimmy Carter, who oversaw a massive expansion of the federal judiciary. Trump appointed 54 judges to the crucial U.C. Courts of Appeals, also more than any other president in a single term except for Carter. Trump also oversaw a booming economy for much of his term, passed a tax cut that is still highly popular among Republicans and redefined U.S. trade policy.Trump helmed the U.S. through an era full of change, including a burgeoning geopolitical rivalry with China. To address the threat from that country and others, Trump created a new branch of the military, the Space Force. Trump also oversaw a remarkable turnaround in the functionality of the Veterans Administration.In the final full day of Trump's presidency, his State Department made a historic determination that China is committing genocide against Uyghur Muslims, a direct accusation of crimes against humanity past presidents have been reluctant to make against other nations. In the waning months of his administration, the U.S. managed to make significant progress in facilitating Middle East peace, including the signing of the historic Abraham Accords. But for all his successes, Trump also oversaw a number of failures and controversies. The coronavirus pandemic killed more than 400,000 in Trump's final year in office alone, and he was often criticized for not taking the pandemic seriously enough and downplaying the seriousness of the virus.   President Donald Trump and Amy Coney Barrett stand on the Blue Room Balcony after Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas administered the Constitutional Oath to her on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, Monday, Oct. 26, 2020.

Both of Trump's 2016 campaign chairmen, Paul Manafort and Steve Bannon, received pardons from the president in his final weeks in office. So did longtime adviser Roger Stone.BIDEN TO SIGN 17 EXECUTIVE ACTIONS, ORDERS TO REVERSE TRUMP POLICIES, RESTORE OBAMA-ERA PROGRAMS ON FIRST DAYTrump also pardoned former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn after he pleaded guilty -- then aimed to withdraw his plea -- for allegedly lying to the FBI.Former Trump personal attorney Michael Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to multiple crimes, including campaign finance violations involving hush-money payments to women who said they had sex with Trump. Others in Trump's circle who were caught in legal trouble were campaign adviser George Papadopolous and former Deputy Campaign Chairman Rick Gates. Trump, meanwhile, spent much of his presidency fending off sexual assault accusations and investigations into his business dealings.And a number of prominent White House staffers eventually left the administration and denounced Trump, including longtime Republican foreign policy mainstay John Bolton, who was Trump's national security adviser for a time; former Defense Secretary James Mattis; former chief of staff John Kelly; former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson; and most recently former White House Communications Director Alyssa Farah.   In this Aug. 20, 2020, file photo, President Donald Trump's former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, speaks with reporters in New York after pleading not guilty to charges that he ripped off donors to an online fundraising scheme to build a southern border wall.

(AP Photo/Eduardo Munoz Alvarez, File) Trump's presidency was punctuated by two months' worth of battles over the validity of the presidential election that he lost, which eventually led to his impeachment this month. That made him the first president ever to be impeached twice by the House of Representatives. TRUMP PARDONS STEVE BANNON, LIL WAYNE, DOZENS OF OTHERS; ALSO COMMUTES SENTENCESTrump and his allies repeatedly falsely said that he won the presidential election, making claims of widespread voter fraud that were regularly debunked. Dozens of lawsuits uniformly failed in the courts. A plea by Trump to Republican Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to ""find"" enough votes to reverse Trump's loss in the state was unsuccessful. The president eventually gathered a mass of his supporters in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6 before Congress was set to certify the results of Biden's victory in the presidential election. After pitched rhetoric from Trump and his backers at the rally, a pro-Trump mob marched across the city and attacked the Capitol, forcing hundreds of lawmakers and Vice President Mike Pence into hiding. The sacking of the Capitol was the worst attack on the seat of the American government since the British burned it during the War of 1812. Trump was impeached one week later by the House of Representatives for inciting an insurrection. He will face an impeachment trial in the Senate during the first weeks of the Biden administration, which could result in him being barred from holding future office.   Protesters seen all over Capitol building where pro-Trump supporters riot and breached the Capitol. Rioters broke windows and breached the Capitol building in an attempt to overthrow the results of the 2020 election. Police used batons and tear gas grenades to eventually disperse the crowd. Rioters used metal bars and tear gas as well against the police.

With his loyal following making up a significant portion of the Republican base, it will be difficult for Republicans to win primaries without his endorsement or at least embracing him publicly. In perhaps a sign of a president who will remain engaged after his term, Trump's reelection campaign manager Bill Stepien and two other top members of his campaign set up a firm called National Public Affairs which figures to support Trump's political engagement after he leaves office. ""Now, as I prepare to hand power over to a new administration at noon on Wednesday, I want you to know that the movement we started is only just beginning,"" Trump said in his farewell message, released Tuesday.

It broke out after Trump spoke to supporters and repeated his unproven claim that the 2020 election had been ""stolen"" from him.Donald Trump Jr. blasted the move Friday, highlighting the different approaches Twitter has taken to President Trump and Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.TWITTER SUSPENDS @REALDONALDTRUMP ACCOUNT PERMANENTLY""So the ayatollah, and numerous other dictatorial regimes can have Twitter accounts with no issue despite threatening genocide to entire countries and killing homosexuals etc... but The President of the United States should be permanently suspended,"" he tweeted. ""(Former Chinese Communist Party Chairman) Mao would be proud.""The president’s son likely was referencing a move by Twitter earlier Friday to remove an anti-vaccine tweet from Khamenei, but stop short of banning his account. Khamenei claimed the United States’ and other Western nations’ coronavirus vaccines are ""completely untrustworthy.""Other recent tweets, in which he describes the U.S. as ""the enemy"" and vows to take ""revenge"" for the Trump-ordered slaying of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, a state-backed terrorist whom the State Department linked to the killings of 608 U.S. troops during the Iraq War, remained visible Friday evening.Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., raised similar concerns in a tweet of his own and also took issue with Chinese Communist Party officials who falsely claimed the U.S. military sent the coronavirus to China.President Trump for years has used Twitter to speak directly to the American people – sidestepping media gatekeepers and garnering tens of thousands or more reactions to his posts.At least one strategist said the ban could be a blow to the president’s future influence on national politics.FACEBOOK BLOCKS TRUMP INDEFINITELY AFTER CAPITOL RIOT RESPONSELongtime Republican consultant David Carney, a veteran of multiple presidential campaigns over the past three decades, is currently a top political adviser to Texas Gov.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.Twitter announced the permanent suspension of President Trump’s account Friday, following months of flagging his tweets with warnings -- and days after the company said he violated its policies.The platform locked Trump out of his account for the first time this week. The social media company deemed a number of tweets connected to the  violent protests at the Capitol on Wednesday as inflammatory.""After close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around them — specifically how they are being received and interpreted on and off Twitter — we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence,"" the company wrote in a blog post.  A screengrab of President Trump's personal Twitter page Friday Later, when the president shared three messages from the official @POTUS handle, Twitter quickly took them down. He sent the same text out in a statement to White House reporters, criticizing Twitter as an opponent of free speech and teasing a potential new conservative social media platform in the future.  A screengrab showing three tweets removed from the official @POTUS account The official account had, until that point, not shared any tweets since late December. It will be transferred to President-elect Joe Biden after Inauguration Day and remains active.TRUMP SAYS HE WON'T ATTEND BIDEN'S INAUGURATIONThe president’s account was suspended Wednesday night after he posted a video with a message for protesters who had stormed the Capitol earlier. After violence that led to multiple deaths, Trump told them to ""go home,"" but maintained that the 2020 presidential election was ""stolen"" from him.Twitter removed the president’s video before suspending his account and warning that further violations of the platform’s policies could result in a ""permanent suspension.""Sharing two tweets from the president Friday, including one in which he said he would not attend President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration on Jan. 20, the company argued that they had to be viewed in part of a greater context.FACEBOOK BLOCKS TRUMP IDNEFINITELY AFTER CAPITOL RIOT RESPONSEThe other read: ""The 75,000,000 great American Patriots who voted for me, AMERICA FIRST, and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, will have a GIANT VOICE long into the future. They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!""""The mention of his supporters having a 'GIANT VOICE long into the future' and that 'They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!' is being interpreted as further indication that President Trump does not plan to facilitate an 'orderly transition' and instead that he plans to continue to support, empower, and shield those who believe he won the election,"" Twitter stated.The blog post claimed plans for future armed protests over the election results already were being shared both on and off the platform -- ""including a proposed secondary attack"" on Capitol Hill.""These two Tweets must be read in the context of broader events in the country and the ways in which the President’s statements can be mobilized by different audiences, including to incite violence, as well as in the context of the pattern of behavior from this account in recent weeks,"" the company said. ""After assessing the language in these Tweets against our Glorification of Violence policy, we have determined that these Tweets are in violation of the Glorification of Violence Policy and the user @realDonaldTrump should be immediately permanently suspended from the service.""Jason Miller, a senior advisor to Trump's 2020 campaign, called the move ""disgusting.""""Big Tech wants to cancel all 75M @realDonaldTrump supporters,"" he wrote on the platform. ""If you don’t think they’re coming for you next, you’re wrong.""For years, the president has used Twitter to communicate directly to the American people -- bypassing the media and other gatekeepers of information. But some of his more fiery tweets have drawn criticism, sometimes from his own party.Twitter confirmed in early December that special privileges granted to world leaders are rescinded once they leave office. The platform has a public interest exemption for prominent figures whose words are newsworthy and important for their citizens to read, even if they violate the rules.TWITTER WEIGHS IN ON WHETHER TRUMP COULD BE BANNED AFTER LEAVING OFFICETrump’s personal Twitter account had more than 88 million followers as of last month. Amid the 2020 presidential election, Twitter began attaching ""fact-checking"" warnings to some of Trump's tweets. Messages containing unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud garnered warning tags that read, ""This claim about election fraud is disputed.""Facebook also permanently blocked Trump on Thursday night.""We believe the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great,"" CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement Thursday. ""Therefore, we are extending the block we have placed on his Facebook and Instagram accounts indefinitely and for at least the next two weeks until the peaceful transition of power is complete.""White House Deputy Press Secretary Judd Deere slammed the company at the time.""It is indisputable that nobody has been more successful at using digital media than President Trump to communicate directly with the American people, but it’s incredibly ironic, yet not surprising, that when the President spoke to the country at a critical time Big Tech chose to censor and block him from doing so,"" Deere told Fox News. ""Big Tech is out of control.""The White House did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment on his permanent Twitter suspension.Twitter’s longstanding policy is to ban accounts that promote violent extremism, share personal information of others in order to harass them (also known as doxing), or engage in abusive behavior or operating fake accounts, among other violations. The company argued Friday that Trump's most recent tweets risked inspiring people to ""replicate the violent acts that took place on January 6, 2021.""And after Wednesday's rioting on Capitol Hill, the company appeared ready to take more drastic action.""The use of the words 'American Patriots' to describe some of his supporters is also being interpreted as support for those committing violent acts at the US Capitol,"" Twitter said.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPEarlier in the day, Twitter also permanently banned Trump allies Michael Flynn and the attorney Sidney Powell for ""harmful activity"" on the platform.

The travel ban was updated later that year to include North Korea and Venezuela.

"As Trump's border wall tops 450-mile goal, CBP chief says more ...",2021-01-05 13:04:00," close      Video Fox News Flash top headlines for January 5 Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.The Trump administration on Tuesday announced that the number of miles of wall at the southern border had topped 450, a key election promise set by President Trump – with a top official saying that about 350 miles more is already funded.""This isn't just a remarkable achievement, I think it’s an historic accomplishment for many factors,"" Acting Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Commissioner Mark Morgan said during a call with reporters.AS BORDER NUMBERS INCREASE, CBP CHIEF SAYS US FACES 'FULL-BLOWN CRISIS' IF TRUMP-ERA POLICIES ENDPresident Trump had made the pledge of 450 miles by the end of 2020 as part of an effort to show that his administration had succeeded in his central 2016 campaign promise of building the wall at the border. At the beginning of January 2020, only 100 miles had been built.Morgan said he was briefed that the goal had been met on Dec. 31, 2020, and said he thought back to those who said such a goal was not possible.""We were challenged and a lot of people didn’t think we were going to be able to get it done,"" he said.While much of the wall has been replacement for existing structures, officials have repeatedly noted that the enormous 30-foot structures – complete with anti-climb technology and cameras – are radically different from the old landing mat that it replaced.The wall was fiercely opposed by Democrats as well as immigration and environmental activists. Morgan praised President Trump for continuing to back the effort even as the administration fought against numerous lawsuits, as well as opposition to funding on Capitol Hill.""He actually listened and heard from the experts, from the folks on the border, on the frontlines of America’s borders every single day, who are risking and sacrificing so much,"" he said. ""He didn't just hear them, he listened to them, he spent time with them, traveled down to the border, learned about the border, heard from them."" VideoMorgan has said that the 450 miles does not mark an end to the project, and pointed to $1.375 billion that was included in the recent omnibus spending bill passed by Congress and signed by President Trump.That money completes a total of about $16 billion for the wall system, Morgan said, which will fund a total of almost 800 miles of new wall.""So in addition to the 450 that we’ve already got on the ground, we’ve got funded 350 miles of wall system to go in the ground,"" he said. ""The overwhelming amount of those miles, that funding, the contracts have already been awarded.""WHAT HAPPENS TO THE BORDER WALL UNDER A PRESIDENT BIDEN?The future of construction at the border is unclear. President-elect Joe Biden opposed wall construction and has promised that ""there will not be another foot of wall constructed on my administration.""However, it might not be that simple. Morgan warned that with those contracts already awarded, it would cost the U.S. ""billions"" to suddenly walk away from those contracts and could cost thousands of jobs.The challenge marks one of a number that the Biden administration will have to navigate if it wants to dramatically change track on immigration. Biden has promised to end a number of key Trump policies on illegal immigration and asylum – leading to fears that such changes could lead to a border surge and a new migration crisis.Top Biden officials recently warned that changes may take longer than some had expected.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP""Processing capacity at the border is not like a light that you can just switch on and off,"" incoming domestic policy adviser Susan Rice told Spanish wire service EFE recently. ""Migrants and asylum seekers absolutely should not believe those in the region peddling the idea that the border will suddenly be fully open to process everyone on Day 1. It will not."" Morgan called such remarks a ""glimmer of hope"" but also added that merely delaying moves like abolishing the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) would not mean that such a crisis would not happen.""They just kicked the crisis can down the road,"" he warned.

No girl should ever have to face this in her lifetime. The bipartisan nature of this legislation shows that when it comes to the safety of young girls, politics shouldn't matter,"" Bottner added in a statement.An estimated 8,000 girls endure FGM – a practice entailing the full or partial slicing out of female genitals – worldwide every day. More than 3 million are forced to endure it annually.The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies the procedure as a severe human rights violation with no medical benefits. Rather, it brings with it extreme physical and emotional health consequences from sexual dysfunction, incontinence and increased risk of HIV transmission to the risk of infection and uncontrolled bleeding.LAW BANNING FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION RULED UNCONSTITUTIONAL; MICHIGAN DOCTORS CLEARED OF CHARGESFGM is considered not to be a religious practice but rather a cultural one designed to ensure girls retain their ""purity"" before marriage despite its grave ramifications. ""In an incredibly difficult year, the little girls in our country who are vulnerable to this painful practice were not forgotten,"" Ayaan Hirsi Ali, founder of AHA Foundation and FGM survivor, said in a statement. ""The STOP FGM Act is a strong bill that makes it clear that in this country, we do not tolerate this practice, and we will not stand idly by as girls are cut.""According to Congress, it is ""a form of child abuse, gender discrimination and violence against women and girls,"" and a ""global problem whose eradication requires international cooperation and enforcement at the national level.""""The United States should demonstrate its commitment to the rights of women and girls by leading the way in the international community in banning this abhorrent practice,"" the newly-inked bill states. FORT HOOD'S TOXIC CULTURE?

Trump urged Georgia election official to 'find' votes in phone call ...,2021-01-03 16:56:00," close      Video Trump doubles down on election claims in audio obtained by Washington Post A.B. Stoddard, Jessica Tarlov and Gayle Trotter weigh in on 'America's News HQ.'President Trump insisted that he won the state of Georgia in the 2020 presidential race during a phone call with Georgia’s Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger over the weekend, reportedly urging him to ""find"" enough votes to reverse the state’s results.The Washington Post reported on the conversation, and obtained audio of the phone call, which they published in full online Sunday.During the call, the president reportedly says: ""All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have. Because we won the state.""Georgia certified election results show that Trump’s Democratic opponent Joe Biden won the state’s Nov. 3 election by 11,779 votes.The president confirmed Sunday morning that he had spoken with Raffensperger on Saturday about ""voter fraud in Georgia.""""He was unwilling, or unable, to answer questions such as the ‘ballots under table’ scam, ballot destruction, out of state ‘voters’, dead voters, and more,"" Trump tweeted. ""He has no clue!""Raffensperger replied Sunday morning stating: ""Respectfully, President Trump: What you’re saying is not true. The truth will come out.""In an interview with Fox News on Sunday, Raffensperger confirmed that the phone call took place on Saturday, and added that he told the president that he would have to turn to other states to find enough voter irregularities to overturn the 2020 presidential race, because there was not enough in the state of Georgia to do so.Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller, on Sunday, tweeted that the ""full recording will show that @GaSecofState is still a hack, @realDonaldTrump is spot-on in his criticisms of the terrible job Raffensperger did, all of the officials running Georgia’s elections are trash, and @POTUS  won the state. #MAGA"" Meanwhile, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., on Sunday slammed the president for a ""disgraceful effort to intimidate an elected official"" into ""misrepresenting"" the results of the 2020 election, and called for a ""criminal investigation"" into his conduct.""President Trump’s recorded conversation with Georgia Secretary of State Raffensperger is more than a pathetic, rambling, delusional rant,"" Durbin said in a statement. ""His disgraceful effort to intimidate an elected official into deliberately changing and misrepresenting the legally confirmed vote totals in his state strikes at the heart of our democracy and merits nothing less than a criminal investigation.""Durbin added: ""The president is unhinged and dangerous. Those who encourage and support his conduct, including my Senate colleagues, are putting the orderly and peaceful transition of power in our nation at risk.""Trump’s call with Raffensperger came just days before the state’s Tuesday, Jan. 5, Senate runoffs, pitting Sen. Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga., against Democrat Raphael Warnock and Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., against Democrat Jon Ossoff.President Trump has refused to concede to President-elect Joe Biden, and his campaign has launched a number of legal challenges. The president, himself, has urged states with Republican governors and legislatures to overturn Biden’s victories.  But while the Trump campaign has challenged the results in dozens of lawsuits, judges in multiple states have shot them down. Attorney General William Barr told the Associated Press last month that ""to date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election.""Meanwhile, on Wednesday, Jan. 6, Congress is slated to vote to certify the Electoral College results.But over the weekend, a group of GOP senators led by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said they would object to the certification unless there was an emergency 10-day audit of the results by an electoral commission; and Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., last month said he would object to, at least, the results in Pennsylvania.Meanwhile, two House Republican officials told Fox News that more than 100 GOP House members will object to the election results in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada and Wisconsin.The Associated Press contributed to this report.   Brooke Singman is a Fox News Digital politics reporter.

Ten Republicans joined with Democrats.Trump has just one week left in office, but the supporters of the impeachment push say Trump is too dangerous to stay in office a minute longer. The impeachment resolution condemns Trump for spreading lies that he won the election in a landslide and whipping up a crowd of supporters in Washington D.C. before the riot that killed five people, including a Capitol Police officer. ""The bottom line is this: This Capitol was stormed. People died because of the big lies that were being told by this president, and by too many people on the other side of the aisle. Enough,"" said Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., in a floor speech before the vote. ""People should be outraged as to what happened. It was unforgivable, unconscionable.REP.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) ((AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite))Unlike the last House impeachment of Trump in December 2019 for soliciting foreign interference in the presidential election, Democrats had GOP support. Rep. Liz Cheney, the No. 3 House Republican, backed impeachment because she said the violent attack at the Capitol could not have happened without Trump.""The president of the United States summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack,"" said Cheney, who is from Wyoming. ""Everything that followed was his doing.""LIZ CHENEY FACES BACKLASH FROM SOME GOP LAWMAKERS AFTER BACKING TRUMP IMPEACHMENTJoining Cheney in support of impeachment were GOP Reps.

""With a heavy heart, I will vote to impeach President Donald J. Trump.""Most Republicans, however, voted against the rushed impeachment because Trump is already exiting office and the political action would do little to unite a fractured country. Some die-hard Trump supporters in the House also believe Trump is not responsible for the violent actions of his supporters since the president specifically didn't call for violence. ""If we impeached every politician who gave a fiery speech to a crowd of partisans, this Capitol would be deserted,"" Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Calif. said. ""That's what the president did. That is all he did.""Republicans point to Trump's speech at the Stop the Steal rally where he said: ""I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.""McClintock accused Democrats of making provocative speeches this summer in support of Black Lives Matter protests that precipitated violence and looting in the name of racial injustice. He said Democrats should be prepared for consequences the next time when the ""lunatic fringe"" of their party acts out.""I cannot think of a more petty, vindictive and gratuitous act than to impeach an already defeated president a week before he is to leave office,"" McClintock said.   In this Jan. 6, 2021, file photo, Trump supporters try to break through a police barrier at the Capitol in Washington.

(AP Photo/Julio Cortez, File) The impeachment debate happened without any Judiciary Committee hearings. Democrats rushed the resolution to the floor just one week after the mob attacked the Capitol, destroyed property and stopped the work of both chambers of Congress in certifying Biden's win. Shell-shocked members recalled the harrowing attack on the Capitol where a woman was shot outside the House chamber, rioters beat police officers with fire extinguishers and the mob went hunting for Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Vice President Mike Pence.   Members of the U.S. National Guard arrive at the U.S. Capitol on January 12, 2021 in Washington, DC.

(Photo by Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images) The aftermath of the attack was prevalent as military troops were stationed throughout the Capitol Wednesday to protect the complex as the impeachment debate continued and a peaceful transfer of power hung in the balance.The House already called on Pence to remove Trump from office through the 25th Amendment. Pence, who presided over the Jan. 6 joint session of Congress, was targeted by raged Trump supporters calling for his hanging after Trump erroneously suggested the vice president had the power to stop Biden from becoming president.Pence, however, declined to invoke the 25th Amendment and Republican members, like Rep. Tom Cole, said they trust their former colleague's judgment that Trump is fit to serve the remainder of his term.  Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla. Cole said while Trump bears some responsibility for the attack, impeachment is not the answer. ""Jan. 6, 2021, will live in my memory as the darkest day during my time of service as a member of this House,"" said Cole, who has been in office for 18 years. ""But instead of moving forward as a unifying force, the majority in the House is choosing to divide us further.""DEM LAWMAKER DEFENDS 2017 TRUMP ELECTORAL OBJECTION AS 'PROTEST VOTE' UNDER PRESSURE FROM JORDANThe one article of impeachment is for ""incitement of insurrection"" and states that Trump engaged in high crimes and misdemeanors by ""willfully inciting violence against the government of the United States.""Trump encouraged his supporters to gather in Washington on Jan. 6 for a ""wild"" gathering. The four-page impeachment resolution quotes excerpts from Trump's speech where he repeated the false claim ""we won this election, and we won it by a landslide.""Trump refused to concede the election and encouraged his supporters to march to the Capitol where he wanted Congress to vote against the certification of Biden's victory. ""If you don’t fight like hell you’re not going to have a country anymore,"" Trump said.PELOSI DENOUNCES TRUMP AS 'CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER' IN IMPEACHMENT PUSH: 'HE MUST GO'The resolution also calls out Trump for his Jan. 2 phone call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger where he urged the election official to ""find"" enough votes to overturn Biden's win in the state -- and appeared to issue subtle threats if Raffensperger failed to do so.Trump's actions warrant removal from office and ""disqualification"" to run ever again, the impeachment resolution states.Some Republicans had sought to avoid impeachment all together and build bipartisan support for censure -- a step below impeachment.Even House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said Wednesday he'd support censure over impeachment. ""The President bears responsibility for Wednesday’s attack on Congress by mob rioters,"" McCarthy said. ""He should have immediately denounced the mob when he saw what was unfolding.""OFFICIALS RAMP UP CAPITOL SECURITY AHEAD OF BIDEN INAUGURATION AMID THREATS OF ARMED PROTESTSBut House Democrats were too intent on impeachment and anger over the attack fueled the swift action on Wednesday.""He must go,"" Pelosi said.

(Kevin Dietsch/Pool via AP) Now, Pelosi will send the article of impeachment over to the Senate. Once they arrive, the Senate will convene a trial that will take place after Trump leaves office. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D.N.Y., had been pressuring Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to reconvene the Senate immediately under 2004 emergency powers. But McConnell's team informed Schumer's office Wednesday they would not consent. McConnell confirmed the delay in a statement after the impeachment vote and said the trial won't take place until after Biden is inaugurated on Jan. 20.""I believe it will best serve our nation if Congress and the executive branch spend the next seven days completely focused on facilitating a safe inauguration and an orderly transfer of power to the incoming Biden Administration,"" McConnell said. It's unclear whether Trump would be found guilty in the Senate. It would require the vote of two-thirds of the body. The most damning consequence for Trump would be being barred from running for president again in 2024, which could lessen his grip on the Republican Party and free up the GOP field for new leaders.McConnell supported Democrats' move to initiate impeachment proceedings against Trump and is ""done"" and ""furious"" with him, sources familiar told Fox News.But McConnell wrote to his GOP colleagues Wednesday that he is undecided on whether to convict Trump. ""While the press has been full of speculation, I have not made a final decision on how I will vote and I intend to listen to the legal arguments when they are presented to the Senate.""The Senate acquitted Trump in February 2020 on both articles of impeachment last time, with Sen.

Jonathan Turley: It's legally absurd to claim Trump committed crime ...,2021-01-06 05:00:00," close      Video Trump call with Georgia secretary of state draws bipartisan criticism FOX News chief White House correspondent John Roberts joins 'Special Report' with the latest on leaked audioFor many legal analysts, President Trump remains a type of criminal Midas figure: everything he says or does turns instantly into a crime. This pattern is continuing to the very end of the Trump administration. Within minutes of the leaking of a Saturday call between Trump and Georgia election officials, the same experts were declaring yet another clear crime. The loudest was Andrew Weissmann, whose desire to find a crime to use against Trump appears to be moving from the obsessional to the delusional. Since his departure as the top deputy to Special Counsel Robert Mueller, Weissmann (now an MSNBC analyst) seems intent on proving his critics correct about his profound bias against President Trump.Weissmann recently called for prosecutors to use grand juries to pursue Trump and others in an unrelenting campaign based on unfounded legal theories. Now he is claiming that the president’s call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger is clear evidence of a criminal act. While I clearly come to these questions from the counter perspective of a criminal defense attorney, the claim is legally absurd.TRUMP LAWYER SLAMS GEORGIA SECRETARY OF STATE RAFFENSPERGER FOR 'SECRETLY' RECORDING 'CONFIDENTIAL' CALLWhen the tape was released, many of us immediately criticized the statement of the president that ""I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state.""However, experts immediately declared this yet another clear criminal act and some people even called for a type of twilight impeachment in the last couple weeks of the Trump administration. Weissmann declared that the tape showed ""criminal intent"" as well as ""proof of his motive and his pattern of similar activity."" More from Opinion Tucker Carlson: Forget Trump phone call, here's what really matters about Georgia Senate runoffsGutfeld on the media uproar over Trump's Georgia phone callDoug Schoen: Senate will give Biden problems no matter who wins Georgia runoff electionsThe problem is that Weissmann again left the criminal code and controlling case law behind in his blind pursuit of Trump. As with the obstruction allegations investigated by Mueller and the Ukrainian call that was the basis for Trump’s impeachment by the House of Representatives, this comes down to a question of intent.While most experts are notably vague on the specific criminal provision, one possibility would be election fraud under 52 U.S. 20511. However, such an interpretation comes to a full stop at intent — a required showing of ""knowingly and willfully"" acting to subvert voting.The call Trump participated in was a settlement discussion over election challenges with a variety of lawyers present, not some backroom at the Bada Bing club. The entire stated purpose of the challenges was to count what the Trump campaign alleged were uncounted votes that far surpassed the 11,780 deficit.Trump repeatedly asserted that he won the election and continued to return to the fact that officials only needed to confirm 11,780 of those hundreds of thousands of allegedly uncounted ballots.Nevertheless, experts like Anthony Michael Kreis, a professor at the Georgia State University College of Law, declared that Trump’s ""only demand is to have votes tossed or invented to fabricate a win"" and that ""there’s no way to read this other than a blatant attempt to pressure Georgia officials to lie and alter legitimate election results with a wink and a nod to a looming consequence.""But Trump did not actually say that and it is not the only possible interpretation of what he did say. He was discussing what he viewed as uncounted votes that far exceeded the margin of roughly 12,000 and noting, as part of the request for access to data, that they do not need to find much to overturn the result.In any criminal case, Trump would simply argue that he was restating the point of the pending cases in a settlement negotiation: that the election was not fair and that a review could easily flip the result given the margin.A prosecutor would have to show that Trump clearly knew his theories were bogus and that he did not believe there were sufficient ballots to reach that number. Even if prosecutors could find a basis for establishing intent, they would still be pushing fraud statutes beyond any intelligible limits without more direct evidence of intent. Ironically, this is the very issue that marred Weissmann’s career and the reason many of us viewed his selection by Mueller to be an egregious error.Weissmann was responsible for the overextension of an obstruction provision in a jury instruction that led a unanimous Supreme Court to reverse the conviction in the Arthur Andersen case in 2005. Weissmann proceeded to make the same exaggerated claims with Mueller (which were apparently rejected by the staff) and has continued to do so as a MSNBC analyst.Weissmann seems impervious to conflicting case law, including Supreme Court decisions rejecting such broad interpretations of fraud, bribery and extortion statutes in political corruption cases. In Kelly v. United States, the Supreme Court threw out the convictions in the ""Bridgegate"" case and unanimously ruled that fraud laws are ""limited in scope"" and Congress ""did not authorize federal prosecutors to ""set standards of disclosure and good government for local and state officials.""Weissmann’s fraud prosecution would be based on a statement that could be easily defended as part of a settlement discussion without any clear threat or benefit discussed. They were discussing what Trump was seeking access to data and his belief that fraudulent, and possible criminal, conduct marred the results. One can reject those claims (as I have) without converting the matter into a faux criminal case.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTERYet, some are not satisfied with just a condemnation of Trump. They want a prosecution. To that end, another former prosecutor, Daniel Goldman, stepped forward to offer his own assurances of a criminal case to be made against Trump. (House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., previously hired Goldman, who earlier called Trump a ""shameful"" person who ""doesn’t care about the country"" and committed a variety of crimes).Goldman focused on the line ""It’s gonna be costly to you."" Goldman said that ""I’ve charged extortion in mob cases with similar language.""In reality, Trump said ""it’s going to be very costly in many ways"" which is very different than ""it will be costly to you."" The extortion theory is the same basic theory that was raised in the Trump impeachment hearing. I testified at that hearing and noted that this type of interpretation has been previously rejected by the Supreme Court.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPI would be interested to see the cases that Goldman charged solely on this type of line. The statement in a settlement that further litigation is going to be ""costly"" is hardly unprecedented. Moreover, Trump stated after that line: ""I think you have to say that you’re going to reexamine it, and you can reexamine it, but reexamine it with people that want to find answers, not people that don’t want to find answers."" If Goldman did bring cases on that type of evidence, it is chilling in its own right.Of course, none of this matters. That is just law and this is legal entertainment. In our media echo chambers, such views are rarely challenged. Viewers hear what they hoped to hear from experts who are eager to supply endless theories of criminality. But the same flexibility and creativity applied to the criminal code does not extend to figures like Hunter or Joe Biden. Trump just has that criminal Midas touch.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM JONATHAN TURLEY   Jonathan Turley is the Shapiro professor of public interest law at George Washington University and a practicing criminal defense attorney.

Trump tweeted. Protesters from the pro-Trump rally descended on the Capitol, clashing with police and leading authorities to lockdown the buildings.Pence was rushed out of the House chamber. Fox News has learned that a shooting victim was transported from the U.S. Capitol, as windows and doors were broken, and guns were drawn on the House floor.

Harvard students seek to revoke Trump graduates' diplomas after ...,2021-01-14 19:32:00,"   Video They’re at it again.  Following last year’s efforts to ban Trump Administration officials from speaking on campus, Harvard University students are now circulating a petition that calls for revoking degrees from Trump supporters and aides who attended the elite Ivy League institution, FOX Business has learned.The reason cited, according to a copy of the petition reviewed by FOX Business, is that supporters of President Trump were involved in spreading the “disinformation and mistrust” that led to last week’s deadly riot at the United States Capitol Building. HARVARD LETTER TO REVOKE SELECT GRADS CONNECTED TO TRUMP Harvard Letter 2021 by FOX Business on Scribd
The petition is entitled, “Revoke their Degrees,” and was circulated by four students who attend Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, FOX Business has confirmed. It calls on the university to be “Prepared to take a stand for representative democracy and against violent white supremacy,” by specifically revoking degrees of three Harvard graduates who are supporters of the president: White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany, Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX), and Representative Dan Crenshaw (R-TX).All were described as “violent actors” who need to be held accountable for their alleged actions, the petition said. A spokesman for Harvard declined to comment other than to say the university is aware of the petition. McEnany, Cruz and Crenshaw had no immediate comment.JASON CHAFFETZ: EVIDENCE OF 'BIG CONSPIRACY' BEHIND CAPITOL RIOTThe petition began circulating on Wednesday and is said to be gaining some traction among both current and former students, FOX Business has learned.“I was surprised how popular this petition is even among mid-career students"" one student who says he won't sign on to the effort and spoke on the condition of anonymity because he's afraid of reprisals. “It’s one thing for 22-year-olds to sign onto something radical but another thing for 40-year-olds to buy into it.”The petition argues that a Harvard degree is “a privilege, not a right” and therefore no one is entitled to keep their degree if they violate certain laws and societal norms. Some supporters of the effort have cited Harvard’s decision in 2010 to revoke a degree from a Russian spy, Andrey Bezrukov, as setting a precedent for revoking degrees from Trump associates.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESSBut legal scholars say any move to revoke a degree would face serious court challenges. They say the Bezrukov example is a poor one because he attended the school using a pseudonym and pleaded guilty to spying on the US.Meanwhile, none of the people named as targets in the petition are being investigated for inciting last week's unrest. The president, himself, is under investigation for possibly inciting the D.C. riot, but such cases are difficult to prosecute.“It would be illegal and highly immoral to revoke a degree based on constitutionally protected actions like former students merely supporting the president,” Alan Dershowitz the Felix Frankfurter Professor of Law, Emeritus at Harvard Law, told FOX Business. “And the end result would be to jeopardize federal funding"" because the university would then become a de facto political institution, Dershowitz, who wrote the 2018 book, ""The Case Against Impeaching Trump,"" added.In November, FOX Business was first to report that students were circulating a petition to ban Trump aides and supporters from campus speaking engagements or merely walking on campus. The effort dissolved quickly and was not taken up by the University's leadership.But the latest petition may have more teeth as it comes in the wake of last week’s violent pro-Trump protests that led to five deaths, and widespread outrage over the president's refusal to concede the 2020 election to Joe Biden -- a move that was supported by many Republicans.Last week, for example, a Harvard Kennedy student named Diego Garcia Blum, once again demanded that Harvard Dean Larry Bacow ban Trump associates from the university. It was co-signed by 300 students, the Harvard Crimson student newspaper reported. Earlier this week, a Harvard Kennedy School professor Ryan Enos wrote a similar letter to Bacow, the Crimson also reported.GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE On Tuesday, Harvard announced it was removing Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) from The Harvard Institute of Politics Senior Advisory Committee for voting against certifying the 2020 election. Kennedy School Dean Douglas Elmendorf said in a statement that Stefanik ""has made public assertions about voter fraud in November’s presidential election that have no basis in evidence, and she has made public statements about court actions related to the election that are incorrect… Moreover, these assertions and statements do not reflect policy disagreements but bear on the foundations of the electoral process through which this country’s leaders are chosen.”","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",15,20.0,0.0628,0.867,0.07020000000000001,-0.005880000000000019,0.096,0.841,0.063,-0.9888,-0.08820000000000028,3.799272630718951,180.0,0.021107070170660838
Ari Fleischer: Trump is a political wrecking ball — but with ...,2021-01-15 06:00:00," close      Video Fleischer: Peaceful transfers of power were a hallmark of America until now Fox News contributor Ari Fleischer on the fallout of violence in Washington.President Trump entered office in 2017 as a political wrecking ball. He leaves the presidency Wednesday as an even bigger wrecking ball. In between, he was a wrecking ball with accomplishments.However, the problem with wrecking balls is that unless they are controlled by a skilled operator, they can swing backward and harm the person controlling them. That’s a good description of what Trump has done throughout his presidency, from some of his tweets to some of his more inflammatory statements — and especially after he stirred the pot that helped inspire the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.The rioters marred the president’s accomplishments and did tremendous damage to a worthy cause, especially for over 74 million peaceful Americans who voted for Trump.DAN SCAVINO TELLS TRUMP OFFICIALS TO BE ‘PROUD’ OF ACCOMPLISHMENTSTrump marred his own accomplishments as well, but still, he should be judged for what he did throughout his presidency, the good and the bad. There is something to learn about America too, considering how many people supported him.Trump won the second-most votes ever in a presidential election, after President-elect Joe Biden, who received about 7 million more.The president’s appeal is and was that he is an anti-Washington outsider. A massive number of Americans don’t trust politicians and hold Washington in low regard. Many yearn for someone authentic, who bluntly speaks his or her mind.Add to the mix a Congress that barely functions, problems that don’t get solved, and experts, including a biased media, that accepted the false Trump-Russia collusion charges made by Democrats. It’s no wonder the public was open to an outsider who threatened to disrupt the government.Trump had some remarkable accomplishments on his watch. VideoPrior to the arrival of COVID-19, the U.S. poverty rate dropped to its lowest level since 1959, an amazing fact that barely received any attention because the news came out during the pandemic.In fact, in late 2018 Trump did more to lift up the poor than any of his predecessors, including President Lyndon Johnson, who launched the War on Poverty.The unemployment rate for those without a high school diploma, pre-pandemic, also hit the lowest level in recorded history. Hispanic and African American unemployment hit record lows.Wages, stagnant for a decade, shot up under Trump, especially for working blue-collar Americans. These people benefitted greatly by Trump’s low-tax and deregulation policies.Unfortunately, the economic dislocation caused by the coronavirus wiped out many of the benefits on the jobs front that Trump had achieved.More from Opinion Michael Goodwin: Democrats want to bring down anyone who ever backed TrumpDan Gainor: CNN goes full-throttle after Trump supporters, includes them in same group as Nazis, Klan membersJason Chaffetz: Democrats have leveraged pandemic, economic pain and civil unrest for political gainIn addition, the president brought relative peace to the Middle East. He virtually destroyed ISIS and helped achieve remarkable peace agreements that will lead to diplomatic relations between four Muslim nations and Israel — an extraordinary accomplishment.Trump stood up to China, resetting the terms of relations between our countries. He understands that China is a growing threat to America — economically, morally and militarily. He opened people’s eyes to these problems and stood up to China using tariffs — a tool no typical politicians would have used. The president’s appointments to federal courts, especially the Supreme Court, will have an impact for decades.Politically, Trump was a mixed bag, although he fared better than President Barack Obama. Obama and Trump both came into office with the House and Senate under their party’s control and each left having lost those institutions.However, Democrats lost 13 seats in the Senate under Obama, while Republicans lost just one under Trump between 2017 and this year.Under Obama, Democrats lost 69 seats in the House. Under Trump, the GOP lost 29 House seats.Obama left behind a wiped-out, unpopular Democratic Party. Trump leaves an exhausted and split Republican Party that almost took the House in November, has a 50-50 tie in the Senate and still has control of most governorships and statehouses. The GOP in 2021 is in a much better position than it was in 2009.Trump’s biggest problem was and is himself. He regularly went too far, crossed too many lines, and offended too many people. If he had toned himself down a notch or three, he could have kept many of the voters who liked his tough, blunt approach without losing as many women and college graduates, especially in the suburbs, who were turned off by his tweets and his demeaning behavior.It’s one thing to fight when necessary, but it’s another to fight everyone, including your allies, almost all the time, in ways that go too far, culminating in a takeover of the Capitol by pro-Trump forces. The march took place after Trump summoned his supporters to come to Washington Jan. 6 and then instructed them at a rally to march to the Capitol.""You’ll never take back our country with weakness,"" Trump told the crowd. ""You have to show strength, and you have to be strong.""CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTERRemember the first presidential candidate debate, the one in which Trump and Biden interrupted each other all night long? Then there was the second debate, where Trump bit his tongue.If his four years were more like the second debate than the first, Trump would likely be enjoying another four years as president.But that’s not who Trump is. He is an alpha-male who often pushes conspiracy theories and stays focused on his own greatness. He lost an election and never accepted the truth about it. His personality dominates his accomplishments. He thinks that’s why he won; he doesn’t understand that’s why he lost.As for what happens next, the future for Republicans might not look bright right now, but it is.The GOP should be America’s blue-collar, populist, outsider party, dedicated to individual and religious freedom. It should be the party that stands up to China. And it should do all this without saying or doing crazy things that scare college-educated voters, especially women.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe Republican Party must resist violence in all forms, denounce White supremacy and continue to grow in Black and Hispanic communities. Donald Trump is the very definition of unique. No other candidate will be like him.A steady outsider will emerge who is Trump-like in policy, without being Donald Trump.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.President Trump declared ""I kept my promises"" on Tuesday regarding his pledge to build a wall at the southern border.His statement was made to mark 450 miles of construction along the border as his administration continues to handle damage control because of the fallout from the riot at the Capitol last week.""For years, politicians ran for office promising to secure the border – only to get elected and do the absolute exact opposite, they even promised a wall,"" he said in Alamo, Texas, where he signed a plaque on the wall. ""But unlike those who came before me, I kept my promises. Today, we celebrate an extraordinary milestone: the completion of the promised 450 miles of border wall,"" he said.  President Donald Trump tours a section of the U.S.-Mexico border wall under construction Tuesday, Jan. 12, 2021, in Alamo, Texas. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) Trump had promised that his administration would build 450 miles of wall by the end of 2020 and last week officials announced that that had been achieved. Additionally, there are more than 300 miles under construction or pre-construction. It’s a remarkable shift in construction from last year -- where only 100 miles had been built by Jan. 2020.IF BIDEN HALTS BORDER WALL, IT COULD COST TAXPAYERS BILLIONS, CBP CHIEF WARNSCritics have noted that much of the construction replaces a structure that was always there. But officials have said that there is no comparison between the old landing mat-style structure that could easily be climbed or pushed over, and the new 30-foot steel bollards that are made with anti-climb technology, cameras, lighting and roads.The wall provided a key 2016 campaign promise for Trump and a symbol for his efforts to get tough on illegal immigration. The wall is just one of a number of policies to secure the border. Others include the Migrant Protection Protocols, which keeps migrants in Mexico as they await their hearings, and asylum cooperative agreements with Northern Triangle countries to stem the flow of migrants to the border. VideoThe combined efforts helped end the 2019 border crisis during which more than 100,000 migrants a month flooded toward the border in the spring. This year, the administration was given a tool in the form of a Centers for Disease Control order related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which allows migrants to be quickly returned to home countries within hours of being apprehended.On Tuesday, Trump declared that his administration has ""achieved the most secure southern border in U.S. history.""""We took on the cartels, the coyotes and the special interests and we restored the rule of law,"" he said.AS TRUMP'S BORDER WALL TOPS 450-MILE GOAL, CBP CHIEF SAYS MORE WALL IS COMINGThe trip to the wall gives Trump an opportunity to shift attention to something other than the riots that engulfed the Capitol last Wednesday. Trump has taken heat from Republicans and Democrats for what they say was his instigation of the violence. Democrats have called for Trump’s impeachment and are moving forward with the process, and a number of Cabinet and administration officials have resigned over Trump’s conduct.TRUMP ACKNOWLEDGED HE BEARS SOME BLAME FOR CAPITOL RIOT IN CONVERSATION WITH MCCARTHY: SOURCESOn Tuesday, Trump described the group that stormed the Capitol as a ""mob"" and said they ""trashed the halls of government.""""We believe in the rule of law not in violence or rioting,"" he said.He also brushed off calls for Trump’s cabinet to remove him via the 25th Amendment, saying it would hurt President-elect Joe Biden more than him.""The 25th Amendment is of zero risk to me, but it will come back to haunt Joe Biden,"" he said. ""Be careful what you wish for.""He also warned of a resurgence in illegal immigration if Biden reverses many of his policies on immigration.

In the report, the commission argues that schools ""should reject any curriculum that promotes one-sided partisan opinions, activist propaganda, or factional ideologies that demean America’s heritage, dishonor our heroes, or deny our principles.""Neither America nor any other nation has perfectly lived up to the universal truths of equality, liberty, justice and government by consent,"" the report says.

""They disdain today’s students, just as they doubt the humanity, goodness or benevolence in America’s greatest historical figures.

It’s not unlikely they would want to contaminate other nations.""While Twitter did take action by removing Khamenei's anti-vaccine tweet, his account still remains intact. Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, critics have blasted Twitter for its inaction on tweets from Chinese government-controlled accounts posted by state officials and state-run media outlets that have spread disinformation about the virus and its origins. RUBIO BLASTS TWITTER FOR INACTION ON CHINESE OFFICIAL'S TWEET WITH DOCTORED IMAGE OF AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERA November tweet, for example, from the Chinese propaganda outlet ""People's Daily, China"" read, ""All available evidence suggests that #COVID19 did not start in central China’s Wuhan, but may come into China through imported frozen food products and their packaging: experts.""At the time, Twitter told Fox News that it was looking into the tweet but never followed up with a response.

The decision was made ""due to the risk of further incitement of violence,"" according to a statement on the company’s blog.  TWITTER SUSPENDS @REALDONALDTRUMP ACCOUNT PERMANENTLYMany users were confused, then, to see such a violent item in the trending section.CONSERVATIVES FLEE TO PARLER FOLLOWING TWITTER'S PERMANENT SUSPENSION OF TRUMPTwitter appeared to notice the trend at some point: on the Twitter Trending USA site, which tracks the past 12 hours of the top 10 trending, the item does not appear. ""We blocked the phrase and other variations of it from trending,"" a Twitter spokesperson told Fox News on Saturday. ""We want trends to promote healthy discussions on Twitter.""PENCE TO OPPOSE 25TH AMENDMENT POWERS TO REMOVE TRUMP FROM OFFICE""This means that at times, we may prevent certain content from trending. As per our Help Center, there are Rules for trends -- if we identify accounts that violate these rules, we’ll take enforcement action."" Some users were quick to point out that the trending item was not due to fresh threats, but rather that users were circulating a video from the Wednesday riot at the U.S. Capitol.In the video, protesters could be heard chanting the phrase repeatedly.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPNo matter the reason, some users believed that allowing the item to trend at all was hypocritical after Twitter explicitly cited ""violence"" as the reason Trump was suspended.

Indoor dining gets OK in big cities – just after Trump leaves office ...,2021-01-23 05:10:00,"   Video Several U.S. cities and states have announced plans to lift restrictions on indoor dining at bars and restaurants – in moves that come less than week after a change at the White House. The lifting of local-level restrictions – many of them in blue states -- was expected to give local economies a boost during the early days of the Biden administration following months of business-strangling shutdowns while President Trump was in charge.Trump generally preferred to allow states to make their own decisions regarding the coronavirus while Biden was expected to take a more national approach. On Friday, for example, Biden unveiled executive orders intended to provide food assistance to low-income families and protect workers’ rights during the pandemic.      President Biden, left, and President Trump have backed different approaches to addressing the coronavirus pandemic and its impact on U.S. businesses. (Associated Press)In December, U.S. employers slashed 140,000 jobs, with many of the cuts happening at bars and restaurants because of coronavirus-related limits on business, The Associated Press reported.  But in Illinois, indoor dining was expected to resume Saturday in Chicago and its Cook County suburbs, with restaurants allowed to welcome customers at 25% capacity, or 25 people per room, provided local infection rates stay the same or improve, FOX 32 of Chicago reported.The move comes as the Chicago area shifts from Tier 2 to Tier 1 restrictions under Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s virus mitigation plan, according to the station.In Washington, D.C., indoor dining resumed Friday after Mayor Muriel Bowser, also a Democrat, lifted a “holiday pause” that was initially supposed to end Jan. 15, but that she extended to Friday to prevent tourists from packing restaurants during the week of President Biden’s inauguration, The Washington Post reported.DC MAYOR BOWSER CONFIRMS INDOOR BAR AND RESTAURANT SERVICE TO RESUME AT 25% CAPACITY STARTING JAN. 22Next week, Washington will see a “Restaurant Week” promotion, designed to boost business at local establishments, the newspaper reported.     Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser speaks in Washington, June 25, 2020. (Reuters)The change in the capital city’s restaurant policy came despite the city remaining in the “red zone” for coronavirus infections – meaning it has been averaging more than 15 new cases per 100,000 residents each day, the Post reported.In nearby Baltimore, both indoor and outdoor dining resumed Friday, with indoor dining at 25% capacity and outdoor dining at 50% capacity, with customers facing a one-hour time limit for their sit-down meals, FOX 45 of Baltimore reported.“We’re just hopeful that we can continue to keep them open and hopeful that our cases continue to go the way they have,” Mayor Brandon Scott, a Democrat, told the station.The change in Baltimore came as hospitalizations were down in the city and the rate for positive coronavirus tests was at 5.6%, the station reported.In Michigan, indoor dining is expected to resume in Detroit and other cities on Feb. 1, after months of closures. The loosening rules also allow for concession sales at casinos, movie theaters and sports stadiums, FOX 2 of Detroit reported.The new rules, in place until at least Feb. 21, call for a 25% capacity at bars and restaurants accommodating up to 100 people, tables six feet apart, and a 10 p.m. curfew, according to the station.Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer – who served on President Biden’s inauguration committee -- announced the looser restaurant rules Friday, after returning from the inauguration in Washington despite having urged her fellow Michiganders to limit travel.

The efforts we have made together to protect our families, frontline workers and hospitals have dramatically reduced cases and we have saved lives,"" Whitmer said in a statement, according to FOX 2.Not all areas were expecting to see dining limits lifted soon, however.GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERECalifornia and New York, for example, still had many limits in place against bars and restaurants.In California, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom’s orders have prohibited both indoor and outdoor dining, allowing only pickup or delivery in areas where hospital ICU capacity falls below 15%.In New York, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo shut down indoor dining after the state’s infection rate started climbing again. But in a “State of the State” address earlier this month, he suggested the shutdown wouldn’t last long-term.""We simply cannot stay closed until the vaccine hits critical mass,"" Cuomo said.

Trump's booming stock market in peril as Biden assumes presidency ...,2021-01-20 07:45:00,"   Video The record-breaking stock market that President Elect Joe Biden will inherit from President Trump is in danger of a post-Inauguration Day selloff, according to Wall Street strategists. Tax hikes and a significantly improving economy leading to higher interest rates are concerns that could become driving forces for markets later this year.BIDEN'S TRILLION-DOLLAR SPENDING MAY RESTORE INFLATION MISSING SINCE '08 CRISIS “Post-inauguration correction likely on peak policy, profits & positioning,” wrote Michael Harnett, chief investment strategist at Bank of America. The S&P 500 grew at a 13.73% annualized rate, or 67.26%, over Trump’s term, the index’s third-biggest annualized gain under a president, as investors celebrated tax cuts and the rolling back of regulations. The benchmark index, which set 150 records under Trump, finished 0.6% below its all-time high on Tuesday, the final full trading day of his term.The Nasdaq Composite index, meanwhile, posted a 24.17% annualized return, the largest under a president since the exchanges debut in 1971 during the Nixon administration. The tech-heavy index set 183 records during Trump’s four years in the White House.“Markets are priced for perfection,” said Greg Valliere, chief U.S. policy strategist at Toronto-based AGF Investments, which has $38.8 billion in assets.Biden has pledged to raise the top corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%. The rate was lowered as part of Trump’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which also encouraged U.S. corporations to bring home $1 trillion of overseas cash.GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HEREOther tax changes being considered are hiking the top tax rate on capital gains and dividends to 43%, up from 24%, and also raising the income tax for the highest earners.Aside from higher taxes, investors must grapple with the implications a red-hot U.S. economy will have on interest rates.Economists at Goldman Sachs forecast U.S. gross domestic product will grow at a 5% annual rate in the first quarter of 2021 and a 5.8% rate for the year, boosted by the recently approved $900 billion COVID-19 relief package. The economy could grow at an even faster pace if Congress passes the $1.9 trillion package that Biden proposed last week. A model from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta that takes into account recent economic data shows the economy likely grew at a 7.4% annualized rate during the fourth quarter of last year after growing at a record 33.4% pace in the third quarter as businesses began to reopen following COVID-19 lockdowns.STOCK MARKET BRACING FOR 'REGIME CHANGE' AMID WASHINGTON POWER SHIFT: GUNDLACHEnthusiasm surrounding the economic recovery has caused skittishness in the bond market where selling of U.S. Treasurys has resulted in the 10-year yield climbing from 0.515% on Aug. 4 to X% on Tuesday. The rally has come despite the Federal Reserve reiterating its pledge to keep interest rates near zero through at least 2023.Valliere said he “wouldn’t be shocked” to see the 10-year yield reach 1.5% by the summer and warns the yield approaching 2% would be a “concern for the stock market,” which has seen a relentless bid fueled by the Fed’s promise to keep rates low and talk of additional fiscal stimulus from Congress.The S&P 500 price-to-earnings ratio is currently trading at 27.4 compared with its historic average of 17.6 going back to 2000, according to Dow Jones Market Data.The options market is “pointing to even higher prices,” said Anthony Saliba, CEO of the Chicago-based Matrix Execution Group, an executing broker-dealer that specializes in options and equities. ""There's more demand for the calls than there is supply.""CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESSThe preference of owning calls versus puts indicates investors are choosing not to buy protection which is typically done to guard against a downside move.Saliba, who has been betting against the market since the week after the election while trading into and out of the positions, concedes there is nothing pointing to an imminent reversal in the stock market, yet he is still looking for a sharp move lower. “I think you get through inauguration, you see the infighting among the Democratic Party and then I think people say, ‘Maybe I better take some profits,’” Saliba said.","{'neg': 0.213, 'neu': 0.787, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.4019}",12,33.0,0.045399999999999996,0.8817999999999999,0.0728,0.31715000000000004,0.04,0.886,0.074,0.9706,3.8058000000000005,-18.26625686813187,118.0,-0.15479878701806668

""They were provoked by the president and other powerful people.""INAUGURATION SECURITY AROUND US CAPITOL TIGHTENS AS HUNT FOR DC PIPE BOMB SUSPECT CONTINUES""...But we pressed on.

Since his election defeat, Trump has refused to concede, claimed he won the election in a landslide and spread allegations of extensive election fraud despite courts repeatedly rejecting his claims.The culmination of his efforts to stop Biden from taking office came when he called his supporters to Washington on Jan. 6 and whipped up the crowd before they marched to the Capitol to try to stop Congress from certifying Biden's win.The insurrection forced Congress to abruptly recess and take shelter.

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta) McConnell is seen as the lynchpin to any chance Trump would be convicted in the Senate. Unlike some of his GOP colleagues, McConnell has not rejected impeachment outright and said he'd carefully weigh the evidence during a trial. If McConnell joins with Democrats in convicting Trump, he may clear the way for 16 other Republicans to join him to reach the two-thirds vote threshold.McConnell and GOP Senate leadership have not been whipping their colleagues to hold the line and protect Trump.

Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., the incoming majority leader, met with McConnell later Tuesday afternoon for about 30 minutes to discuss a new power-sharing agreement, Biden cabinet nominations and how to proceed on impeachment.

Trump had signed the executive order on Jan. 28, 2017 — just eight days after he was sworn in as president — as part of his broader campaign pledge to ""drain the swamp.""The measure, known as ""Ethics Commitments by Executive Branch Appointees,"" barred political appointees from any lobbying related to their agency for five years and also imposed a lifetime ban on lobbying on behalf of a foreign government. Every Trump appointee was required to sign a pledge agreeing to the rules. TRUMP ISSUES 73 PARDONS, 70 COMMUTATIONS; READ THE FULL LIST But early Wednesday, on the final day of his presidency, Trump lifted the executive order, effectively allowing his former aides to become lobbyists or work for foreign governments.President-elect Joe Biden is reportedly planning to issue his own executive order addressing ethics standards at the White House shortly after he's inaugurated on Wednesday.His plan, first reported by The Washington Post, is to prohibit officials who leave the administration from lobbying the White House for Biden's duration in office. Employees who leave toward the end of Biden's tenure will be prohibited from lobbying the White House for at least two years. Another provision will prohibit incoming administration officials from accepting “golden parachute” payments from their former employers for taking a government job.TRUMP RELEASES FAREWELL MESSAGE ON EVE OF WHITE HOUSE DEPARTUREThe new rules seek to strengthen Obama-era practices intending to minimize ethics complications posed by the so-called revolving door.

John Roberts reports from the White House.President Trump's attorney on Monday said the president and his legal team were ""disappointed"" that Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger ""secretly recorded and released"" what he described as a ""confidential settlement discussion"" about the Georgia election results. The attorney's comments come after audio of Trump's Saturday phone call with Raffensperger was obtained by The Washington Post, and published in full, in which the president urged the secretary of state to ""find"" enough votes to reverse the state's election results. ""We are disappointed that the secretary of state and his staff secretly recorded and released a confidential settlement discussion to settle the two pending lawsuits,"" Trump attorney Kurt Hilbert said Monday. ""While they may think that behavior is appropriate, we do not,"" Hilbert continued. ""Consequently, we will not be commenting on settlement discussions."" Meanwhile, a Georgia government source told Fox News on Monday that Trump tried to contact Raffensperger 18 previous times before Saturday's call. TRUMP URGED GEORGIA ELECTION OFFICIALS TO 'FIND' VOTES IN PHONE CALL, INSISTING HE WONDuring the call, according to audio obtained by The Washington Post, the president said: ""All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have. Because we won the state.""According to the Post, Trump later added: ""So what are we going to do here, folks? I only need 11,000 votes. Fellas, I need 11,000 votes. Give me a break.""Georgia certified election results show that Trump’s Democratic opponent Joe Biden won the state’s Nov. 3 election by 11,779 votes.Meanwhile, the president confirmed Sunday morning that he had spoken with Raffensperger on Saturday about ""voter fraud in Georgia.""""He was unwilling, or unable, to answer questions such as the ‘ballots under table’ scam, ballot destruction, out of state ‘voters’, dead voters, and more,"" Trump tweeted. ""He has no clue!""Raffensperger replied Sunday morning, stating: ""Respectfully, President Trump: What you’re saying is not true. The truth will come out.""In an interview with Fox News on Sunday, Raffensperger confirmed that the phone call took place on Saturday, and added that he told the president that he would have to turn to other states to find enough voter irregularities to overturn the 2020 presidential race, because there was not enough in the state of Georgia to do so. VideoDemocrats are blasting the president for his conduct on the call, with Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., saying that ""his disgraceful effort to intimidate an elected official into deliberately changing and misrepresenting the legally confirmed vote totals in his state strikes at the heart of our democracy and merits nothing less than a criminal investigation.""On Monday, Democratic Reps. Ted Lieu of California and Kathleen Rice of New York sent a criminal referral to the FBI, claiming the president solicited election fraud during the call.The FBI confirmed to Fox News that they received the letter from Lieu and Rice, but declined to comment further.Trump’s call with Raffensperger came just days before the state’s Tuesday, Jan. 5, Senate runoffs, pitting Sen. Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga., against Democrat Raphael Warnock and Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., against Democrat Jon Ossoff.President Trump has refused to concede to President-elect Joe Biden, and his campaign has launched a number of legal challenges. The president, himself, has urged states with Republican governors and legislatures to overturn Biden’s victories.  But while the Trump campaign has challenged the results in dozens of lawsuits, judges in multiple states have shot them down. Attorney General William Barr told the Associated Press last month that ""to date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election.""Meanwhile, on Wednesday, Jan. 6, Congress is slated to vote to certify the Electoral College results.But over the weekend, a group of GOP senators led by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said they would object to the certification unless there was an emergency 10-day audit of the results by an electoral commission; and Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., last month said he would object to, at least, the results in Pennsylvania.It is unclear, at this point, which states, if any, the group of GOP senators led by Cruz will object to.Meanwhile, two House Republican officials told Fox News that more than 100 GOP House members will object to the election results in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada and Wisconsin.Fox News' John Roberts, Kathleen Reuschle, Jake Gibson and The Associated Press contributed to this report.   Brooke Singman is a Fox News Digital politics reporter.

Rand Paul calls Trump impeachment trial 'dead on arrival' after 45 ...,2021-01-26 23:56:00," close      Video Sen. Rand Paul: Trump impeachment trial 'dead on arrival' in Senate Kentucky Republican joins 'Fox News Primetime' to discuss his objection to the 'unconstitutional' Trump impeachment.U.S. Sen. Rand Paul declared former President Trump’s Senate impeachment trial ""dead on arrival"" on Tuesday after 45 Senate Republicans voted against holding the proceeding, viewing it as unconstitutional.Rand, a Kentucky Republican, had called for a procedural vote regarding holding a trial, claiming the Senate shouldn’t address the article of impeachment against Trump filed by the House this month because Trump is now out of office. FORTY-FIVE REPUBLICANS VOTE AGAINST PROCEEDING WITH SENATE IMPEACHMENT TRIALIf a trial were to proceed, Trump would become the first former president to face an impeachment trial.In Paul’s view, the votes of 45 Republicans against holding a trial proved his point – and likely rendered any upcoming trial to be moot.SEN. RAND PAUL CLASHES WITH ABC'S GEORGE STEPHANOPOLOUS: 'YOU'RE FORGETTING WHO YOU ARE AS A JOURNALIST!'""If you voted that it was unconstitutional, how in the world would you ever vote to convict somebody for this?"" Paul told reporters after the vote, according to Politico. ""This vote indicates it’s over. The trial is all over."" VideoPaul added in a Twitter message that the vote showed the House’s impeachment case – charging Trump with ""inciting an insurrection"" in connection with the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol – was ""dead on arrival.""On Tuesday night, during an appearance on ""FOX News Primetime"" with Maria Bartiromo,"" Paul addressed what he saw as a double standard by Democrats.""One of Bernie Sanders' supporters came to the ballfield, nearly killed Steve Scalise ... but nobody talked about impeaching Bernie Sanders. Maxine Waters has said, 'Get up in their face' -- so has Cory Booker -- 'Become a mob, we want you to mob them at restaurants and cause mayhem.' That sounds like an incitement to violence but nobody's talking about impeaching Maxine Waters, nobody's talking about impeaching Bernie Sanders or Cory Booker for saying 'Get up in their face.'""So it's a significant hypocrisy and double standard that they're putting forward and they should be called out on it. Nobody should be shy about calling them out on their hypocrisy.""The only five GOP senators who supported placing Trump on trial were longtime critics of Trump -- Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Mitt Romney of Utah. They voted along with 50 Democrats in the 55-45 tally.In floor marks ahead of the vote, Paul also claimed that the absence of the chief justice of the Supreme Court also made a Senate impeachment trial unconstitutional. Chief Justice John Roberts said he would not preside over the trial because Trump was no longer president.RAND PAUL TO TRIGGER SENATE VOTE ON WHETHER TRUMP IMPEACHMENT TRIAL IS CONSTITUTIONAL""Impeachment is for removal from office and the accused here has already left office,"" Paul had argued prior to the procedural vote. ""Hyper-partisan Democrats are about to drag our great country into the gutter of rancor and vitriol the likes of which has never been seen in our nation’s history.""He also claimed a Senate impeachment trial would be ""the antithesis of unity"" in a nation seeking healing after years of partisan division.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., argued that Paul’s assessment of the situation was ""flat-out wrong,"" claiming it had already been ""completely debunked by constitutional scholars all across the political spectrum."" Article 1 Section 3 of the Constitution states that officials can be barred from holding office ever again through impeachment, Schumer said. The House voted to impeach Trump on Jan. 13, one week after rioters stormed the Capitol following a nearby Trump rally on the day that Congress was gathering to certify Democrat Joe Biden’s Dec. 14 Electoral College victory.

"GOP sours on Trump, but many cling to election hoax | Fox News",2021-01-15 16:15:00," close      Video Baier: More concern about possible state capital protests next week 'Special Report' anchor provides insight to Capitol Hill riot investigation on 'Bill Hemmer Reports'**Want FOX News Halftime Report in your inbox every day? Sign up here.** On the roster: GOP sours on Trump, but many cling to election hoax - Feds probe riot failures, prepare for more unrest - Many in Senate GOP look for way around impeachment - Biden taps team to solve vaccine struggle - Feathered follow up: Watch for pigeon fraud GOP SOURS ON TRUMP, BUT MANY CLING TO ELECTION HOAXPresident Trump’s post-election conduct, especially as it relates to the sacking of the Capitol, is driving down his support among Republicans.A new survey from the Pew Research Center found that Republican disapproval of Trump’s conduct has reached 20 percent, double what it was in the immediate wake of the election.More than half – 52 percent – of Republicans said that Trump bears at least some of the responsibility for the Capitol attack. One in five Republicans said Trump should be removed from office before the end of his term.Just a quarter of Republicans still back Trump across the board, saying that he has behaved well since the election, bears no responsibility for the attack, actually won a second term and should continue to be ""a major political figure for many years to come.""Those numbers, coupled with an overall job approval rating of 29 percent, seems like a snapshot of a party engaged in a messy but inevitable breakup with a partner in a turbulent relationship. Trump’s approval among Republicans is down to 60 percent from a high of 85 percent last year.With President-elect Joe Biden enjoying the beginnings of a real honeymoon – 64 percent of voters have a positive view of how Biden is conducting himself – it’s possible to see how in just a matter of months Trump, who has consumed the national consciousness at such length like no political figure since perhaps Richard Nixon, could fade from view.But even as Republicans begin the process of moving on, one number stands out among Republican attitudes about this presidency: 64 percent of Republicans said that Trump either definitely or probably was the actual winner of the 2020 election. Seventy percent of Trump voters said that fraud was a major reason for the election result.As the Georgia Senate runoffs demonstrated, these opinions may be of serious long-term consequences of Republican ambitions. If you had convinced your core supporters that elections are rigged it tends to make turnout efforts far more complicated.Georgia’s government, which has a well-run, secure elections system, was not able to convince a significant number of Trump’s core supporters that elections in the Peach State are free and fair. If the extraordinary efforts these officials took to prove the validity of their system was not enough, what would convince such skeptics?The consequences of Trump’s sustained effort to convince people, even before the election took place, that he would be cheated may have other lasting consequences for Republicans and the nation.While election fraud is certainly real, as examples from both parties in recent electoral history prove, it is no good when a majority of one of the major parties is inclined not to respect the results of elections that are overwhelmingly properly conducted in most of the country.We are managing the peaceful transfer of power by the skin of our teeth this time, but if 64 percent of Republicans have been duped into believing that Trump actually won in what he calls a ""landslide"" it is sadly possible to imagine the day that this long, invaluable continuum may come to an end.Certainly the more Republicans bleat about stolen elections to cater to a political base that holds such an outlandish belief the more likely it will be that Democrats who assail our elections system on the grounds of disenfranchisement through voter identification etc. will escalate their efforts to hit the kill switch on the American system.The false belief in a stolen election has another consequence for Republicans: If you pretend Trump did not really lose, you will not be able to learn the correct lessons from his loss.In the months and years to come, there will be a brutal fight within the GOP on how to proceed. While Trump certainly opened many political doors for Republicans with working-class voters and his populist appeals definitely increased intensity, a worthwhile assessment of his political acumen and approach cannot take place if nearly two thirds of Republicans are still snowed under Trump’s election deception.It is certainly important for Congress as a whole and Republicans in both chambers to sort out how to respond to the events of Jan. 6, but it would seem the crucial work of the party for its long term health would relate to disenchanting its voters from the magical thinking that the loser really won.Many of those voters may not like it, but a lie that damaging will do far more harm if left to fester.THE RULEBOOK: WHAT IT IS ""What, then, are the distinctive characters of the republican form?

The band suggested the bird found in a Melbourne backyard on Dec. 26 was a racing pigeon that had left the U.S. state of Oregon, 13,000 kilometers (8,000 miles) away, two months earlier. On that basis, Australian authorities on Thursday said they considered the bird a disease risk and planned to kill it. But Deone Roberts, sport development manager for the Oklahoma-based American Racing Pigeon Union, said on Friday the band was fake. The band number belongs to a blue bar pigeon in the United States which is not the bird pictured in Australia, she said. ‘The bird band in Australia is counterfeit and not traceable,’ Roberts said. ‘They do not need to kill him.’ Australia’s Agriculture Department, which is responsible for biosecurity, agreed that the pigeon dubbed Joe, after U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, was wearing a ‘fraudulent copy’ leg band.""AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…""In speed (‘blitz’) chess, you’ve got five or 10 minutes to play your entire game.

It is not clear at this point whether McConnell would vote to convict.One source told Fox News that McConnell has not made up his mind about what to do about impeachment, and does not see this as a partisan exercise like the previous impeachment effort against Trump. Another source told Fox News that McConnell told associates that impeachment will help rid the Republican Party of Trump and his movement.The New York Times first reported that McConnell was pleased that House Democrats introduced an article of impeachment against Trump.A source close to McConnell told Fox News that ""nobody is pleased by anything."" Meanwhile, other sources told Fox News that there is ""no love lost there.""Part of McConnell’s anger, according to sources, is that the Senate Majority was lost to the Democrats just last Tuesday in the Georgia Senate runoffs, but sources said that McConnell is extremely upset about the president’s actions Wednesday leading up to the riot at the Capitol.McConnell’s office did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.Last week, after the Capitol riot, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, McConnell’s wife, resigned from her post, citing the president’s conduct.Meanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., vowed to bring articles of impeachment to the House floor for consideration on Wednesday morning.Democratic Reps. Ted Lieu, David Cicilline, Jamie Raskin and Jerrold Nadler this week introduced the articles of impeachment against Trump, charging the president with violating his oath of office. Democrats on Tuesday are also pushing a resolution calling on Vice President Mike Pence to use the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office.""In his conduct while President of the United States -- and in violation of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the office of President of the United States, and to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in violation of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, Donald John Trump engaged in high Crimes and Misdemeanors by inciting violence against the Government of the United States,"" the article reads.The article alleges that before Jan. 6, the joint session of Congress to certify the presidential election results, Trump ""repeatedly issued false statements asserting that the presidential election results were the product of widespread fraud and should not be accepted by the American people or certified by State or Federal officials.""The article claims that before the Jan. 6 joint session the president addressed a crowd in Washington where he ""reiterated false claims that 'we won this election, and we won it by a landslide,' and ""willfully made statements that, in context, encouraged -- and foreseeably resulted in --lawless action at the Capitol.""The article refers to Trump's statement: ""If you don't fight like hell you're not going to have a country anymore."" ""Thus incited by President Trump, members of the crowd he had addressed, in an attempt to, among other objectives, interfere with the Joint Session's solemn constitutional duty to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election, unlawfully breached and vandalized the Capitol, injured and killed law enforcement personnel, menaced Members of Congress, the Vice President and Congressional personnel, and engaged in other violent, deadly, destructive, and seditious acts,"" the article states.The article adds that Trump's conduct ""followed his prior efforts to subvert and obstruct the certification of the 2020 Presidential election,"" referring to his phone call earlier this month with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, where he pressured him to ""find"" enough votes to overturn the state's election results. ""In all this, President Trump gravely endangered the security of the United States and its institutions of Government,"" the article states. ""He threatened the integrity of the democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power, and imperiled a coequal branch of Government."" The article adds that he ""betrayed his trust as President, to the manifest injury of the people of the United States."" ""Donald John Trump thus warrants impeachment and trial, removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States,"" it said. The calls for Trump’s removal come after the president spoke at a rally Wednesday, telling supporters that he would ""never concede,"" and repeated unsubstantiated claims that the election was ""stolen"" from him and that he won in a ""landslide.""During Trump's remarks, he renewed pressure on Pence to swing the vote back toward himself. He claimed that Pence should decertify the results of the presidential election and send it ""back to the states,"" claiming that if he did that, Trump would be president for another four years.Trump’s remarks came ahead of a joint session of Congress to certify the results of the presidential election. As members of the House and Senate raised objections to certain electoral votes, both chambers called for a recess and left their chambers as pro-Trump protesters breached the Capitol building.Washington Metro police said the security breach at the Capitol resulted in four deaths – including a woman who had been shot inside the building – and at least 70 arrests.Congress later returned and certified the Electoral College vote early Thursday, in favor of President-elect Joe Biden.White House deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino posted a statement from the president on Twitter early Thursday morning: ""Even though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on January 20th.""""I have always said we would continue our fight to ensure that only legal votes were counted,"" Trump said. ""While this represents the end of the greatest first term in presidential history, it's only the beginning of our fight to Make America Great Again!""Meanwhile, President Trump acknowledged that he bears some blame for the Capitol riot last week during a conversation with House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, a source familiar told Fox News.Two sources say McCarthy, R-Calif., relayed the president’s sentiment on a call Monday with the House GOP Conference.McCarthy, on the call Monday with Republicans, agreed that Trump bore blame for the unrest, which sent Congress into lockdown as they tried to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election last week.The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The House voted to impeach Trump in December 2019, but the Senate acquitted him on both articles of impeachment – abuse of power and obstruction of Congress – in February 2020.The House impeachment inquiry began after the president pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a phone call in July 2019 to look into Biden’s role pressing for the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor who had been investigating the founder of Burisma Holdings – a Ukrainian natural gas firm where his son, Hunter, sat on the board.CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APPTrump's pressure campaign against Ukraine prompted a whistleblower complaint which resulted in the impeachment inquiry.The president’s request came after millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been frozen, which Democrats cited as a quid pro quo arrangement.Fox News' Chad Pergram and Jacqui Heinrich contributed to this report.   Brooke Singman is a Fox News Digital politics reporter.

Kennedy once said. A hundred years hence, history books will recall President Trump for his two impeachments and detail the deadly U.S. Capitol riot that he is accused of fomenting — never mind that he told his supporters at a rally near the White House: ""I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard."" [Emphasis added.]Regardless, historians will dwell on the ensuing mayhem.Pity.ARI FLEISCHER: TRUMP IS A POLITICAL WRECKING BALL — BUT WITH REMARKABLE ACCOMPLISHMENTSOne hundred years from now, a fair-minded assessment of Trump’s presidency will recognize his abundant domestic and international accomplishments. Liberals unborn may be appalled. Conservatives unconceived may applaud. But both should agree that Trump was a consequential president whose sleeplessness achieved significant things, often while astonishing foes and friends alike.—The $1.5 trillion Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a globally competitive 21% corporate tax rate, immediate deduction of business expenses, eight regulations junked for every new one inflicted, and Washington’s overall pro-business tone helped generate the most robust economy in U.S. history.—Total employment (peaking at 158,803,000 working Americans in December 2019) never was higher. Black and Hispanic unemployment sank to their lowest levels ever, with female unemployment the lowest since President Dwight Eisenhower. Median household income in 2019 hit a record $68,703 — up 6.8% from 2018. Wages grew a healthy 3.6% that year, even as the left’s favorite adult toy, income inequality, slid for the second consecutive year under Trump, after rising under President Barack Obama.—America’s poverty rate fell to 10.5% in 2019, a record low, with Black poverty at 18.8%, its first year ever below 20 %.—Stock markets soared, thanks to Trumponomics. Since January 20, 2017, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed from 19,732 to 30,814 Friday — up 56.2%. On Trump’s watch, the S&P 500 has rocketed from 2,263 to 3,768 — a 66.5 % boost. And the NASDAQ has grown from 5,540 to 12,998 — 134.6% higher. This is spectacular news for billionaires on yachts and, more important, some 78 million Americans with IRAs, 401(k)s, traditional pensions, and other workplace retirement plans.—Trump’s approval of the Keystone XL Pipeline, oil exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, fracking projects, and other initiatives have made America energy independent. The U.S. is now a net energy exporter, to OPEC’s regret and the frustration of Russian President Vladimir Putin — Trump’s ""boss,"" according to four years of baseless, unsubstantiated, evidence-free Democratic lies.—For those who care, expanded natural gas production under Trump helped cut U.S. carbon dioxide emissions to their lowest level since 1985.—Trump and the GOP Senate placed 231 constitutionalist jurists on the federal bench: Three Supreme Court justices, 54 appellate judges, and 174 trial-court appointees. The 2nd (New York City), 3rd (Philadelphia), and 11th (Atlanta) circuit courts of appeals all had Democratic-nominated majorities in 2017. Trump’s designees have turned these into Republican-majority appellate bodies.—Trump’s signature on the First Step Act criminal-justice reform ended mass-incarceration and let some 3,100 largely Black, non-violent offenders begin new, mainstream lives in fiscal year 2019. FSA's inmate releases are expected to increase in FY 2021 by 8,700.  —The president pushed school choice, expanded educational savings accounts to cover K-12 students, reauthorized the DC Voucher Program with $85 million in funds, stabilized assistance to Historically Black Colleges and Universities, conditioned federal assistance to colleges on their defense of campus free speech, and (by shredding Obama’s Title IX guidance letter) restored due process for college students (mainly men) often falsely accused of sexual misconduct.—Trump vastly improved Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals, launched veterans medical choice, strengthened health savings accounts, required medical price transparency, and secured for terminally ill patients the right to try experimental drugs. —Trump was the first president to address the National March for Life in person, rather than literally phoning in his remarks. He blocked Title X funds to Planned Parenthood and halted subsidies for abortions overseas.—The president fought for a southern border wall, to stop entry by illegal immigrants, gang members, drug smugglers, terrorists and others who break into America without permission. Overcoming relentless Democratic objections, Trump ultimately prevailed. In fact, the president Tuesday celebrated 452 miles of steel and concrete wall along the southern frontier. This distance roughly separates Manhattan from Greensboro, N.C., and connects San Diego and San Francisco. Consequently, federal apprehensions and encounters on the U.S.-Mexico border have plunged from 977,509 in fiscal year 2019 to 458,088 in fiscal year 2020 — down 53.1%.  —Trump dumped the cost-rich, benefit-poor Paris Climate Accord.—Unlike the last three presidents, Trump finally obeyed the 1995 Jerusalem Embassy Act and moved America’s diplomatic mission to Israel’s capital.—Trump scrapped Obama-Biden administration’s absurd, ayatollah-friendly Iran-nuclear deal.—Trump flushed Obama-Biden’s asphyxiating rules of engagement and sicced U.S. and friendly forces on ISIS in early 2017. By year’s end, the bloodthirsty, primitive, Islamic-extremist caliphate — which Obama-Biden let swell to the size of two New Jerseys — was blasted clean off the map.—ISIS founder Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and Iranian terror master Qasem Soleimani both were killed via American force. Video—Under Trump’s guidance, Israel signed the Abraham Accords — four peace agreements (and the first since 1996) between Jerusalem and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco.—The president confronted China. He applied trade sanctions for its cheating and intellectual property theft, locked up its spy-choked Houston consulate, slapped travel bans on top officials, and more.—While Trump’s diplomacy with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un did not denuclearize that country, the North halted the underground nuclear bomb tests and long-range missile flights that chilled the Obama-Biden years.—The president harangued America’s NATO allies to keep their word and spend at least 2% of GDP on common defense. While four nations complied in 2016, today 10 pay their fair share. Through 2024, an extra $400 billion will fund NATO, not at the expense of U.S. taxpayers. This also aggravates Trump’s supposed ""employer,"" Putin.In short, like FedEx on steroids, President Trump delivered on the right’s economic, cultural, and national security agendas.The COVID-19 pandemicOf course, the Chinese virus arrived a year ago and ruined everything. The pandemic, ensuing lockdowns, and economic devastation lobbed a sledgehammer into Trump’s prosperity machine. Still, the economy recovered with unexpected briskness, although winter infections, clampdowns, and deaths are slowing things anew.Even as Trump ordered hospital ships to New York City and Los Angeles and erected pop-up hospitals across America, he pressed government and industry to produce ventilators, masks, gowns, and other medical gear.Incredibly, Operation Warp Speed yielded two COVID-19 vaccines within nine months of the March 13 national-emergency declaration. That’s five times faster than the quickest vaccine previously developed. The 1967 anti-mumps inoculation took four years to produce.Unfortunately, some governors are injecting these vaccines in slow motion. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, D-N.Y., has failed so extravagantly that expired vials have landed in the trash.Sick.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTERThanks to these triumphs, countless promises made and promises kept, and a parade of late-campaign rallies with at least 25,000 people each, Trump scored 74.2 million votes, the most for an incumbent president seeking reelection.

Trump exits White House with drop in approval ratings | Fox News,2021-01-19 10:40:00," close      Video Trump ‘gave a voice’ to disillusioned voters, spoke to American values: Gerry Baker WSJ Editor-at-Large Gerry Baker discusses whether President Trump will have a lasting influence on the Republican Party.President Trump’s one-term tenure in the White House is ending amid sinking public opinion approval ratings in the wake of this month’s attack on the U.S. Capitol.Only 34% of Americans say they approve of the job Trump’s doing steering the country in the final Gallup national poll of his presidency. That’s down five points from Gallup’s December poll. And Trump’s final approval rating is the lowest of his presidency in Gallup surveys.FOUR UNFORGETTABLE INAUGURATION MOMENTS IN HISTORYThe longtime polling organization noted that ""the 34% job approval rating for Trump in Gallup's Jan. 4-15 poll is one point lower than his prior lowest single rating, registered on several occasions in late 2017.""

Bush and Jimmy Carter also stood at 34% when they exited the White House in 1993 and 1981, respectively. Only President Harry Truman – at 32% in 1953 – ended his presidency at a lower polling mark.Gallup also highlighted that Trump’s average approval rating during his four-year term was 41%, which they say is ""four points lower than for any of his predecessors in Gallup's polling era.""Trump never cracked 50% in Gallup polling. His highest approval rating – reached a couple of times early last year – was 49%.Gallup also spotlighted that ""Trump's ratings showed a record 81-percentage-point average gap between Republicans and Democrats – 11 points wider than the prior record.""LIVE UPDATES FROM FOX NEWS ON THE BIDEN INAUGURATION Other national polls gave Trump slightly better marks as he leaves the White House. Among them are a 43% approval rating in the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll and 41% in a USA Today/Suffolk University survey. In other live telephone operator national surveys, Trump was at 38% in an ABC News/Washington Post poll and 34% in CNN and Quinnipiac University surveys. One of the few polling organizations that the president’s praised – the automated surveys by Rasmussen Reports – put his approval rating at 51%.Trump’s final presidential approval rating stood at 40% in an average of the final surveys compiled by Real Clear Politics.The president leaves office on Wednesday in a precarious situation.He was impeached last week by the House and is awaiting the start of a Senate trial over his encouragement of this month’s deadly insurrection at the Capitol by far-right extremists and Trump supporters aiming to disrupt congressional certification of President-elect Joe Biden’s election victory.   WASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 06: Protesters supporting U.S. President Donald Trump gather near the east front door of the U.S. Capitol after groups breached the building's security on January 06, 2021 in Washington, DC. Pro-Trump protesters entered the U.S. Capitol building during demonstrations in the nation's capital. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images) (Getty Images)All of the latest polls were conducted in the wake of the storming of the Capitol, which resulted in the deaths of five people, including a Capitol Police officer, and widespread vandalism of the building.Trump’s numbers among Republicans remain highWhile the latest polling indicates Trump’s approval ratings have taken a hit among Americans and specifically Republicans, his sway over the party he reshaped and ruled over with near-absolute authority during his four years in the White House remains immense.""Trump still retains incredible support from those who voted for him, but his credibility has collapsed among everyone else,"" veteran Republican pollster Frank Luntz told Fox News.HOW TO WATCH WEDNESDAY'S INAUGURATION While Trump’s numbers among GOP voters have taken a hit, they still remain very healthy.Trump’s approval rating among Republicans stands at a sky-high 87% in the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, down just two points from October. But other polls show a bigger drop among Republicans. Trump’s at 82% in the Gallup poll, down five points from last month. He’s at 73% approval in the Quinnipiac survey, down from 89% last month. CNN puts the outgoing president’s approval rating at 80%, down 14 points from three months ago. Trump’s approval rating among Republicans in the ABC News/Washington Post survey stands at 79%, a drop of nine points from October. And the president’s approval rating in a Pew Research poll stands at 60%, down from 77% in August of last year.Luntz noted that ""Republicans have always been the 'law and order' party. Their opinions of Trump have taken a hit because of continued focus on the events of Jan. 6 and their embarrassment about the violence and destruction. ""The attack on the Capitol came soon after the president urged a large crowd of supporters he addressed at a rally near the White House to march to the Capitol and show strength in protesting the certification of an election he’s repeatedly and falsely claimed was ""rigged.""  President Donald Trump arrives to speak at a rally Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021, in Washington. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) But two-thirds of Republicans questioned in the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll said Trump’s words and actions related to the storming of the Capitol have not changed how they feel about their vote in November for Trump, with nearly three in 10 Republicans saying it reinforces their vote for Trump,  and only 5% say it makes them regret their vote.PENCE FRONT AND CENTER IN DAYS FOLLOWING CAPITOL ATTACKThose sentiments seem to be reflected in the actions of GOP members of Congress. Nearly two-thirds of House Republicans – even after the joint session of Congress was delayed six hours after the attack on the Capitol – objected to certifying the Electoral College results in two states that Biden narrowly edged over Trump in the presidential election. And 197 House Republicans voted last Wednesday against impeaching Trump, with just 10 GOP lawmakers joining all 222 Democrats in voting for impeachment.Ahead of the insurrection, Trump had vowed to play an influential role in the party going forward, threatening to back primary challenges to Republicans up for reelection in 2022 who didn’t support the president’s unsuccessful push to upend his election defeat to Biden. Trump was also flirting with a 2024 presidential run to try and win back the White House.Now, with the possibility of being barred from running for federal office ever again if he’s convicted in the Senate impeachment trial, Trump’s future political ambitions are in a precarious state.According to the Pew Research poll, 57% of Republicans want Trump to remain a major political figure for years to come. Four in 10 Republicans questioned in the survey disagreed.And 55% of Republicans surveyed in the USA Today/Suffolk University poll said they would definitely vote for Trump again if he ran for president in 2024. While that’s a very strong number, it’s down from 71% of Republicans who said the same thing in December.

Had Trump been convicted, the Senate would have moved to bar the 45th president from holding federal office ever again.The seven GOP senators who joined with all Democrats in finding Trump guilty were: Sens. Richard Burr of North Carolina, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah, Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania.Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who presided over the trial announced the vote fell short of the two-thirds majority needed and therefore Trump is ""hereby acquitted of the charge.""The acquittal means that as of now Trump can leave the door open to another White House bid in 2024, though senators have hinted they may still try to bar him from office in a separate 14th Amendment measure. SCHUMER LEAVES DOOR OPEN TO 14TH AMENDMENT MEASURE TO BAR TRUMP FROM OFFICETrump praised the victory, thanked his supporters and promised he'd soon emerge with a ""vision for a bright, radiant, and limitless American future."" The former president, who has largely stayed silent since his impeachment, also took aim at his opponents.TRUMP CELEBRATES ACQUITTAL IN SENATE TRIAL, FORESHADOWS POLITICAL FUTURE: 'MUCH TO SHARE'""This has been yet another phase of the greatest witch hunt in the history of our country,"" Trump said in a statement. ""No president has ever gone through anything like it, and it continues because our opponents cannot forget the almost 75 million people, the highest number ever for a sitting president, who voted for us just a few short months ago.""Trump's second impeachment trial arguments lasted just five days, making it the shortest in presidential history. The previous record was held by Trump in 2020 when his trial related to inviting foreign interference into the election spanned 21 days. The trial surrounded the Jan. 6 riot when pro-Trump supporters stormed the Capitol, beat police officers, chanted ""Hang Mike Pence"" and forced lawmakers to take shelter. The mayhem temporarily stopped Congress' certification of President Biden's Electoral College win.   FILE - In this Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021 file photo, Trump supporters try to break through a police barrier at the Capitol in Washington. Right-wing extremism has previously mostly played out in isolated pockets of America or in smaller cities. In contrast, the deadly attack by rioters on the U.S. Capitol targeted the very heart of government. It brought together members of disparate groups, creating the opportunity for extremists to establish links with each other. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez, File) House impeachment managers accused Trump of inciting the insurrection by spreading a ""big lie"" the election was stolen from him, summoning his supporters to Washington on Jan. 6, telling them to ""fight like hell"" and then refusing to call off the attack once the mob violently took over the Capitol.""He named the date. He named the time. He brought them here, and now he must pay the price,"" lead impeachment manager Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., said in his closing remarks to the Senate. Trump legal's team denounced the proceedings as an unconstitutional ""sham impeachment"" against a private citizen, driven by Democrats' ""hatred"" for Trump and desire to silence a political opponent. Trump lawyers also argued the former president's political speech is protected by the First Amendment and his words on Jan. 6 to his supporters to ""fight like hell"" were not meant literally. To drive home that point during the trial, Trump's defense played an 11-minute video of nearly every Democrat in the chamber using the words ""fight"" in their past speeches and interviews.  In this image from video, House impeachment manager Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., speaks during the second impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump in the Senate at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, Thursday, Feb. 11, 2021. (Senate Television via AP) The vote capped a wild Saturday in Washington with numerous plot twists.In a curveball move, the Senate Saturday morning voted 55-45 to allow witnesses at the trial after Raskin said they wanted to hear from GOP Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler.Raskin cited the ""breaking news"" overnight about details Beutler revealed of a heated phone call that Trump had with House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy during the middle of the Capitol attack.Beutler, who was one of 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Trump in House, released her account of the call late Friday, confirming a CNN report that Trump dismissed McCarthy's pleas to call off the riot and instead told McCarthy that the rioters were ""more upset about the election"" than the House leader.MCCONNELL WILL VOTE TO ACQUIT TRUMP IN SECOND IMPEACHMENT TRIAL, AS DAY FIVE GETS UNDERWAY""When McCarthy finally reached the president on January 6 and asked him to publicly and forcefully call off the riot, the president initially repeated the falsehood that it was antifa that had breached the Capitol,"" Beutler said in her statement. ""McCarthy refuted that and told the president that these were Trump supporters. That's when, according to McCarthy, the president said, 'Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are.'""Trump's legal team blasted the decision to call witnesses and threatened to depose 100 people if the door is open. A visibly angry and animated Michael van der Veen said that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Vice President Kamala Harris would ""absolutely"" need to be deposed, too, but not by Zoom.""These depositions should be done in person in my office in Philadelphia,"" van der Veen told the senators, which drew audible laughter from the Senate chamber. ANOTHER TRUMP IMPEACHMENT TWIST: SENATE SIDESTEPS WITNESSES DESPITE VOTE ALLOWING THEMVan deer Veen shot back: ""I haven't laughed at any of you. And there's nothing laughable here.""  Lawyer Michael T. van der Veen speaks during Trump impeachment trial on Friday, Feb. 12. The surprise vote on witnesses shook Washington and seemed to even catch senators off guard.Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said the move set off ""chaos"" in the chamber. He speculated the trial could last until April with witnesses.""At this point, it's pandemonium,"" Cruz told pool reporters.But just as quickly as the Senate went down the path of witnesses, lawyers then reversed course on Saturday. After a recess where lawyers huddled, Trump's legal team agreed to allow the damaging statement from Beutler to be entered into the trial as evidence. Armed with her statement, House prosecutors then abandoned their demand for witnesses altogether and moved to closing arguments. House managers said the revelations about McCarthy's call with Trump show that Trump abdicated his oath of office by showing support for the rioters and disregard for the security of members of Congress and Pence, who was targeted by the mob for assassination.""He chose retaining his own power over the safety of Americans,"" said Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I. ""I can't imagine more damning evidence of his state of mind.""The arguments, however, weren't enough to sway the 17 GOP senators needed for conviction. MCCONNELL RIPS TRUMP, SAYS ACTIONS 'UNCONSCIONABLE' BUT TRIAL WAS UNCONSTITUTIONALGOP Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., was very critical of Trump's conduct surrounding the Jan. 6 riot and his wife -- former Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao -- even resigned from the administration in the aftermath of the attack that left at least five people dead, including a Capitol Police officer. ""There's no question... that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day,"" McConnell said in a speech after the vote Saturday. Still, McConnell found Trump ""not guilty,"" saying he believes convicting the former president is unconstitutional. ""We have no power to convict and disqualify a former office holder who is now a private citizen,"" McConnell said in a speech.   WASHINGTON, DC - DECEMBER 15: U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) takes questions as he speaks during a news conference with other Senate Republicans at the U.S. Capitol on December 15, 2020 in Washington, DC.

How much will Trump impeachment trial cost? | Fox Business,2021-02-13 18:20:00,"   Video The Trump impeachment trial drew to a close Saturday with no conviction. As lawmakers close out their dramatic arguments for and against impeaching former President Trump for incitement of an insurrection, some are left wondering: how much did the trial cost taxpayers? How much did it cost Trump? It turns out it isn’t entirely clear, and estimates vary widely. Roll Call estimates the first impeachment trial in January 2020 cost $1.83 million. Another estimate, from the Heritage Foundation, put the price tag at $3.06 million, including the salaries of not only lawmakers but 106 congressional staffers and six lawyers.While the figure doesn't include the Senate trial, the tab through December is sharply lower than the one for the impeachment investigation and trial of President Bill Clinton two decades ago. According to CNN, the independent probe into Clinton cost taxpayers $80 million in 1994. But the first Trump impeachment trial was much longer than the second-- the Senate debated impeaching Trump for two weeks and six days in 2020, but only five days in 2021. FIRST TRUMP IMPEACHMENT TRIAL'S AD BONANZA NOT BEING REPEATED Yahoo! Finance estimated the first Trump impeachment at $11.5 million.They calculated that for every dollar of 2019 taxes, the cost is $0.0000026 in the context of the $4.4 trillion spent in 2019 by the federal government.Heightened security around the Capitol in light of the Jan. 6 attack has reportedly cost another $519 million.Meanwhile, the cost of Trump’s current defense could not be confirmed, but it won’t be paid by tax dollars. Through November 2020, the Republican Party paid $225,000 to the law firms of Jay Sekulow and Jane Raskin since 2017, when they were named to Trump’s legal team.CLICK HERE FOR LIVE UPDATES FROM FOX NEWS ON THE TRUMP IMPEACHMENT TRIALThe RNC is likely to pay the duo through February amid the second impeachment trial, people familiar told The Washington Post.GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HEREBecause Trump is on trial as a result of his status as an officeholder or candidate, election law allows him to dip into campaign or party funds for his legal bills. “We are more than happy to cover some of the costs of defending the president from this partisan impeachment sham,” said Mike Reed, RNC deputy chief of staff for communications.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",10,63.0,0.04916666666666667,0.9303333333333333,0.020833333333333332,-0.0013249999999999929,0.03,0.912,0.058,0.9103,-0.013249999999999929,13.743492107843139,152.0,0.09041771123581012
Trump's impeachment trial: Everything you need to know | Fox News,2021-02-10 06:22:00," close      Video Fox News Go Former President Donald Trump's second impeachment trial continues in the Senate on Wednesday after senators voted that they can constitutionally proceed with the affair. Arguments on the merits of the impeachment article are set to begin at 12 p.m. after the Senate on Tuesday voted 56-44 that the trial could move forward after a highly criticized performance from Trump's impeachment lawyers. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., was the only Republican who voted to move ahead with the trial after previously voting that it was unconstitutional on a vote last month. He said that vote ""is not a prejudgment on the final vote to convict.""WHEN DOES THE TRUMP IMPEACHMENT TRIAL START AND HOW DO I WATCH?""If anyone disagrees with my vote and would like an explanation, I ask them to listen to the arguments presented by the House managers and former President Trump’s lawyers. The House managers had much stronger constitutional arguments. The president’s team did not,"" Cassidy said.   President Donald Trump arrives to speak at a rally Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021, in Washington. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) Meanwhile, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said of the Trump legal team's case: ""I don't think it was very persuasive."" ""I thought I knew where he was going, and I really didn't know where he was going,"" Sen Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said of Trump attorney Bruce Castor.""I'm puzzled by the presentation by the first attorney,"" Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said of Castor.""I thought the president's lawyer the first lawyer just rambled on and on and on and didn't really address the constitutional argument,"" added Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. Trump himself was reportedly ""furious"" and ""beyond angry"" with his lawyers' performance Tuesday, sources tell Fox News. ""I'm sorry he felt that way -- have to do better next time,"" Trump lawyer David Schoen said in response to Cassidy's criticisms of the Trump legal team. The former president was impeached on Jan. 13, just one week after a pro-Trump mob overtook the Capitol as Congress and former Vice President Mike Pence were certifying the results of President Biden's win in the 2020 election. TRUMP 'BEYOND ANGRY' WITH IMPEACHMENT DEFENSE TEAM'S SHOWING: SOURCESDemocrats in Congress, and even some Republicans, were outraged that the former president had gathered a rally in Washington, D.C., that day where he repeated his false claims that he won the presidential election and said he did not do enough to stop the attack once his supporters began to breach the Capitol about one hour after his rally's conclusion. But Trump's defenders say he is not responsible for the actions of the criminals that menaced lawmakers and attacked police, and note that later in the day he told his supporters in a Twitter video to go home. As the arguments on the merits of the impeachment begin, Trump's lawyers are expected to say that Trump's words did not equate to incitement and that those who breached the Capitol are the ones fundamentally responsible for their own actions. Meanwhile, the House impeachment managers are expected to argue that Trump's false claims that the election was stolen were at the base of the mob's motivation, so therefore he is the one responsible for the attack on the Capitol.Here's what you need to know about Trump's impeachment trial.What's Trump accused of? Incitement of insurrection is the fundamental charge behind the impeachment article. But that assertion is backed up by the impeachment managers with a litany of other charges about what actions from Trump incited the insurrection and why.  In this Jan. 6, 2021, file photo, violent rioters, loyal to President Donald Trump, storm the Capitol in Washington. (AP Photo/John Minchillo, File) Those include that Trump lied about the results of the presidential election; that he tried to subvert the accurate and fair result of the election; and that he sent the mob of his supporters to the Capitol. HOUSE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS SLAM TRUMP IN FINAL PRE-TRIAL BRIEF: 'MOST GRIEVOUS CONSTITUTIONAL CRIME EVER'""He also willfully made statements that, in context, encouraged – and foreseeably resulted in – lawless action at the Capitol, such as: 'if you don’t fight like hell you’re not going to have a country anymore,'"" the impeachment article says of the Jan. 6 ""Save America Rally"" Trump organized. ""Thus incited by President Trump, members of the crowd he had addressed ... unlawfully breached and vandalized the Capitol, injured and killed law enforcement personnel, menaced members of Congress, the vice president, and congressional personnel, and engaged in other violent, deadly, destructive and seditious acts,"" it continues. The article says the mob aimed to ""interfere with the joint session’s solemn constitutional duty to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election.""Trump's defense team argues the impeachment article is improperly written and should have been split into several articles. The impeachment managers say the individual actions are all part of one ""course of impeachable conduct.""

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta, File) Read more about the accusations against Trump and his team's answer to those charges HERE. How does it work?The trial gaveled in at 1 p.m. on Tuesday with Vermont Democrat Sen. Patrick Leahy, the chamber's president pro tempore, presiding in place of Chief Justice John Roberts. The chief justice is constitutionally required to oversee impeachments of presidents, but Roberts chose not to in this case as Trump is no longer commander-in-chief.  Vice President Harris also could have potentially presided over the trial, although senators have historically presided over impeachment proceedings when the person being tried is not the sitting president. The person overseeing the trial is not expected to substantially affect the outcome. WHO IS SENATE PRO TEMPORE PATRICK LEAHY AND WHY IS HE PRESIDING OVER TRUMP IMPEACHMENT TRIAL?Tuesday saw four hours of debate total, divided between the House impeachment managers and Trump's counsel about whether the impeachment trial is constitutional. The Senate voted 56-44 that the trial can move ahead, with Cassidy switching his vote from last month, when Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., forced a vote on a point of order alleging the trial is constitutional. The sides will then have until 9 a.m. Wednesday to file any motions, and 11 a.m. Wednesday to file responses to those motions, before the arguments on the merits of the impeachment begin at noon Wednesday. The House will present its case first, and it will be allowed up to 16 total hours of argument over the course of two days. Then Trump's lawyers will present their case, also up to 16 hours over two days. Per an agreement between the two sides in the Senate and both parties, the trial will continue through the weekend on both Saturday and Sunday, even though impeachment trials typically take Sundays off. This followed a request from Schoen to have the trial pause on Saturday for the Jewish Sabbath, which was granted but he later withdrew, citing other defense team members' ability to work that day. CAN THE SENATE STOP TRUMP RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AGAIN?After the opening arguments, senators will have four total hours to question the lawyers for each side, then there will be two hours of arguments per party on whether the Senate should bring in any witnesses, which will be followed by a simple majority vote. If the senators do not hear witnesses, it is likely the trial would wrap up by some time next week. If senators do vote to hear witnesses, then that will open up the possibility that the trial could drag on for much longer than anticipated.Both sides would be allowed depositions and ""discovery."" The Senate would then decide which witnesses to hear testimony from. No witnesses can testify until they are first deposed, which would likely happen outside of the Senate floor.The Senate will also take a vote as to whether it should consider evidence.After the evidence and witnesses process, there will be two hours for each party to present closing arguments. Then there will be a vote on whether to convict the former president, which would require a two-thirds supermajority. If Trump is convicted, which is not expected to happen, there would be a subsequent simple-majority vote on whether to bar him from office in the future. Who are the impeachment managers? Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., leads a team of House impeachment managers that also includes Reps. Diana DeGette, D-Colo.; David Cicilline, D-R.I.; Joaquin Castro, D-Texas; Eric Swalwell, D-Calif.; Ted Lieu, D-Calif.; Joe Neguse, D-Colo.; Madeleine Dean, D-Pa.; and nonvoting Delegate Stacey Plaskett of the Virgin Islands. Raskin is a member of the House Oversight Committee, the House Rules Committee and the House Judiciary Committee.  Impeachment manager Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., walks on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, Jan. 13, 2021. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) He penned a letter to Trump’s legal team this week urging him to testify before, or as part of, his Senate trial. Trump’s legal team denied the request, saying they would not take part in an ""unconstitutional"" process.Swalwell, meanwhile, has run into controversy recently over his past relationship with a Chinese spy. TRUMP LAWYERS RAIL AGAINST IMPEACHMENT TRIAL AS 'POLITICAL THEATER' ON EVE OF PROCEEDINGSLearn more about the impeachment managers prosecuting the case against Trump HERE.Who is on Trumps' defense team? The two lead lawyers on Trump's defense team are Bruce Castor, the former district attorney for Montgomery County, Pa., and David Schoen, a longtime civil rights attorney who is the chairman of the American Bar Association's (ABA) Criminal Justice Subcommittee. Schoen was also honored for his pro bono work in 1995 by the ABA and was honored for public interest litigation in 2018 by Boston College Law School, his alma mater. Schoen has ties to former Trump associate Roger Stone, who he represented as he was sentenced to 40 months in prison for witness tampering and other charges in early 2020. And he was one of the final people to meet with Jeffrey Epstein before his death. Schoen said that Epstein planned to bring him onto his legal team and that he does not believe Epstein killed himself. ""I saw him a few days earlier,"" said Schoen on Fox Nation's ""Deep Dive"" last year. ""The reason I say I don't believe it was suicide is for my interaction with him that day. The purpose of asking me to come there that day and over the past previous couple of weeks was to ask me to take over his defense.""  Attorney David Schoen speaks to the media, Wednesday, Jan. 6, Schoen is a civil rights lawyer who is on former President Trump's legal team for his impeachment trial. (Joe Cavaretta/South Florida Sun-Sentinel via AP) MAGS OUT (AP)Castor, according to NBC Philadelphia, recently joined the personal injury firm van der Veen, O'Neill, Hartshorn, and Levin, and joined Trump's team after getting the permission of the firm's founding partner, Michael T. van der Veen. DEM SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY ON TRUMP TRIAL: NOT 'RIDICULOUS' FOR GOP TO ARGUE IT'S UNCONSTITUTIONALVan der Veen then joined the Trump legal team as well, signing on to the Trump pretrial brief submitted Monday. He will play a presenting role this week. Learn more about Schoen HERE.Learn more about Castor HERE.Learn more about van der Veen HERE.Is the impeachment trial constitutional? It depends on who you ask. Republicans tend to say that the trial is unconstitutional, citing the fact that Trump is now out of office and that impeachment trials for presidents need the chief justice of the United States to preside -- and Chief Justice John Roberts is not there. Democrats say the trial is constitutional, citing the 1876 trial of former Secretary of War William Belknap, which occurred after he left office. Belknap was acquitted. They also say that a trial is constitutional because there is still a consequence the Senate can level even if it can no longer remove Trump from office -- a ban on holding office in the future.  VideoEither way, most scholars, regardless of their opinion, say whether the trial is constitutional is still an open question, as there's never before been a trial of a former president, and no court has ruled on the issue. ""I admit this is, of course, a matter of first impression and so I don't think the case that Sen. Paul is making is a ridiculous one,"" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said on ""Fox News Sunday"" of Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul's argument that the trial is unconstitutional. And even if Trump's defense team asked the federal courts for a ruling on this issue, it's extraordinarily unlikely any court would step in to tell the Senate how to run its business. So the decision of whether the trial is constitutional is basically up to senators -- and they said it is on Tuesday, by a 56-44 vote. What are the chances Trump is convicted? Extraordinarily slim. Paul's point of order in the Senate claiming that an impeachment trial of a former president is unconstitutional failed 45-55.That means the trial was upheld as constitutional, but it also means 12 Republicans would have to change their minds about whether the trial is even allowed to happen for the Senate to have any shot of convicting Trump. Cassidy's vote Tuesday that the trial is constitutional moves Democrats marginally closer to their goal, but they still have a long way to go.Besides that, there are political calculations at play. A vote to convict Trump is essentially an invitation for a Trump-backed primary challenge for any Republican. And the general perception within the GOP is that even if Republican elected officials have a distaste for Trump -- as shown by Wyoming GOP Rep. Liz Cheney's resounding victory in a vote of confidence under secret ballot last week -- that the party base is still loyal to the former president.  VideoGoing on the record against Trump is a massive political risk for any Republican. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPWhat happens if Trump is convicted? However unlikely a conviction is at this point, it could still carry some consequences for the former president. Though the main point of impeachment is to remove a person from office if convicted, a person can also be barred from holding office in the future. If Democrats do get the 67 votes they need to convict Trump of inciting an insurrection, then they plan to hold a subsequent vote on barring Trump from office in the future. That would only need a simple majority to pass. If this does happen, Trump could theoretically challenge the constitutionality of the Senate trial in court in the future, aiming to get back his right to run for office. An after-the-fact challenge to the consequences of conviction is likely the only way a court would weigh in on this impeachment. Fox News' Brooke Singman, Kristen Fisher Jason Donner, Chad Pergram and Ronn Blitzer contributed to this report.   Tyler Olson is a for Capitol Hill Producer for Fox News in Washington, D.C.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",94,64.0,0.07619565217391304,0.8639347826086956,0.05989130434782607,-0.14813243243243243,0.091,0.844,0.064,-0.9981,-13.92444864864865,-10.174856540805509,204.0,-0.049876747749046615

When pressed, Irving said he took a call from Sund before while on the Congress floor.Sund and Irving disagreed on when the National Guard was called and on requests for the guard beforehand. Sund said he spoke to both Stenger and Irving about requesting the National Guard in the days before the riot, and that Irving said he was concerned about the ""optics"" of having them present. Irving denied that, saying Sund’s account was ""categorically false.""Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told Fox News earlier this month that he is in favor of a 9/11-style commission to examine key details that contributed to last month’s deadly riot at the Capitol.Republicans have signaled that evidence could show that Democrat leaders were aware of the threat and did little to prevent the Jan. 6 attack.Pelosi said the commission will ""investigate and report on the facts and causes relating to the January 6, 2021, domestic terrorist attack upon the United States Capitol Complex … and relating to the interference with the peaceful transfer of power.""Earlier this month, Mark Meadows, the former White House chief of staff, told Fox News’ ""Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo"" that Trump issued a ""direct order"" to have up to 10,000 troops ready. Trump told Hilton that contrary to reports that have been circulating, he was not watching the riot in real-time and only began following the events later on when he heard about the chaos.Trump said he hated to see the riot but compared it to unrest that occurred in cities like Portland and Seattle.""I hate to see any of that, but it is a double standard,"" he said.The Associated Press contributed to this report  Edmund DeMarche is a senior news editor for FoxNews.com.

The success propelled Parscale to a role as Trump’s campaign manager in 2020.But Parscale’s relationship with Trump soured ahead of the 2020 election amid lukewarm polling numbers and a series of campaign events that failed to draw large crowds. Parscale was removed as Trump’s campaign manager last July and reassigned to his old role as head of digital outreach. VideoThe longtime Trump loyalist left the campaign entirely last September following an altercation at his home in Fort Lauderdale. Police responded after Parscale's wife, Candice Blount, reported that he had barricaded himself inside their home and was threatening to harm himself.After a short standoff with police, Parscale was detained and involuntarily hospitalized. Parscale later attributed the incident to personal and professional stress.""I got to a bad place,"" Parscale said of the incident in an interview with Fox News last December. ""My wife was worried about me. And she helped. And she was there every day by my side, and I love her for it. Despite his exit from Trump’s campaign, Parscale has remained a vocal defender of his former benefactor.

The ongoing investigation the records are part of could also become an issue for Trump in his life after the presidency.

Scott Applewhite, File) The court offered no explanation for the delay, and the legal issue before the justices did not involve whether Trump was due any special deference because he was president.The court's order is a win for Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., who has been seeking Trump's tax records since 2019 as part of an investigation. Vance, a Democrat, had subpoenaed the records from the Mazars accounting firm that has long done work for Trump and his businesses. Mazars has said it would comply with the subpoena, but Trump, a Republican, sued to block the records' release.BIDEN TO GET ANOTHER JUDICIAL APPOINTMENT TO A KEY FEDERAL APPEALS COURTVance's office had said it would be free to enforce the subpoena and obtain the records in the event the Supreme Court declined to step in and halt the records' turnover, but it was unclear when that might happen.The case the high court ruled in involves a grand jury subpoena for more than eight years of Trump's personal and corporate tax records. Vance has disclosed little about what prompted him to request the records. In one court filing last year, however, prosecutors said they were justified in demanding the records because of public reports of ""possibly extensive and protracted criminal conduct at the Trump Organization.""Part of the probe involves payments to two women — porn actress Stormy Daniels and model Karen McDougal — to keep them quiet during the 2016 presidential campaign about alleged extramarital affairs with Trump. Trump has denied the affairs.In July, the justices in a 7-2 ruling rejected Trump's argument that the president is immune from investigation while he holds office or that a prosecutor must show a greater need than normal to obtain the tax records.BIDEN ADMIN TELLS SUPREME COURT OBAMACARE IS CONSTITUTIONAL, A REVERSAL OF TRUMP'S DOJ STANCE IN PENDING CASEJustices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, whom Trump nominated to the high court, joined that decision. It was issued before Trump's third nominee, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, replaced the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the court.As part of its July decision, the high court returned the Vance case and a similar case involving records sought by Congress to lower courts. And the court prevented the records from being turned over while the cases proceeded.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPSince the high court's ruling, in the Vance case, Trump's attorneys made additional arguments that his tax records should not be turned over, but they lost again in federal court in New York and on appeal. It was those rulings that Trump had sought to put on hold.

But McConnell voted to acquit.McConnell's vote had been closely watched since he's been very critical of Trump's role in inciting the Jan. 6 riot, and his wife -- former Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao -- resigned from the administration in the aftermath of the attack that left at least five people dead, including a Capitol Police officer.TRUMP CELEBRATES ACQUITTAL IN SENATE TRIAL, FORESHADOWS POLITICAL FUTURE: 'MUCH TO SHARE'McConnell alerted colleagues of his decision Saturday morning via email before the Senate convened for what could have been the final day of Trump's trial for ""incitement of insurrection.""Conviction was always going to be an uphill climb, since 17 GOP senators would need to join all 50 Democrats to meet the supermajority threshold.Fox News' Sally Persons, Kelly Phares and Caroline McKee contributed to this report.

Mike Lee's objection to 'false' Trump impeachment evidence causes ...,2021-02-11 07:56:00," close      Video Impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump continues Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Wednesday night that the Senate may ""relitigate"" the brouhaha between Sen. Mike Lee and the impeachment managers after Lee objected to how the managers characterized a report about a call former President Donald Trump made to Lee's phone during the Capitol riot.After making their argument over the last two days that Trump should be convicted of inciting an insurrection on the Capitol, the House impeachment managers will continue their case on Thursday. They may take up to eight hours, starting at noon, but it's unclear if they will use all of their allotted time. TRUMP'S IMPEACHMENT TRIAL: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW VideoThe managers are expected to continue to argue that Trump had planted the seeds of the attack on the Capitol for months by saying he could not have lost the presidential election unless there was voter fraud; failing to condemn violence from his supporters; inviting a mass of his supporters to Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6; telling them to go to the Capitol; and failing to make efforts to stop the mob once the riot began. Trump's defense could technically start making their arguments Thursday if the House managers end their opening statements early, but they are more likely to begin on Friday. Trump's defense team is arguing that he was within his First Amendment rights in making his claims about the election and he cannot be held responsible for the actions of the criminals that stormed the Capitol. They also say the impeachment managers are taking Trump's comments out of context.   Jenny Louise Cudd inside the Capitol on Jan. 6. The impeachment trial into former President Donald Trump for allegedly inciting the attack on the Capitol continues on Thursday.  (Criminal complaint.)WILL IMPEACHMENT WITNESSES BE CALLED IN TRUMP TRIAL? HOW THE DECISION COULD IMPACT THE PROCEEDINGSThe impeachment managers have tried to preempt some of Trump's anticipated defenses early in the trial while also maintaining a solemn tone, playing gruesome video of rioters attacking Capitol Police, seeking out lawmakers and their staffs and calling for the death of former Vice President Mike Pence, among others. They've particularly leaned on security footage from the Capitol showing the number of close calls lawmakers had where they could have been swept up and potentially injured or killed by the mob. ""Obviously very troubling to see the great violence that our Capitol Police and others are subjected to,"" Sen Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said when asked about video showing Officer Eugene Goodman, lauded as a hero for his actions in the riot, guiding the senator to safety. ""It tears you at your heart and brings tears to your eyes, that was overwhelmingly distressing and emotional.""But the solemn tone was broken Wednesday during a spat between Lee, R-Utah, and the impeachment managers -- and it could escalate Thursday if the impeachment managers try to ""relitigate"" the point as Schumer, D-N.Y., said may happen. WHO ARE THE DEMOCRATIC TRUMP IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS?As lead impeachment manager Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., was preparing to close down the House's arguments for the day, Lee requested to be recognized and said that the impeachment managers had incorrectly described what happened when Trump called his phone on Jan. 6. He asked that the statement, made by Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., be removed from the record of the trial.   Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, Wednesday got into a spat with House impeachment managers over a phone call former President Trump made to his phone on Jan. 6. LIVE UPDATES: TRUMP IMPEACHMENT TRIAL CONTINUES AS SWALWELL SHARES CAPITOL FOOTAGE""Statements were attributed to me moments ago by the House impeachment managers... relating to the content of conversations between ... President Trump and Senator Tuberville. They were not made by me. They're not accurate and they're contrary to fact,"" Lee said. ""I move... that they be stricken from the record,"" Lee continued. Senate President Pro Tempore Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who is presiding over the impeachment trial, said that Lee's motion was not provided in the rules. Lee then appealed the ruling and requested a roll call vote. But Leahy's statement on what the rule was was not clear and prompted minutes of conversations about what exactly the Senate was about to vote on. Schumer put the Senate into a quorum call ""while we work this out.""It appears that what Lee was objecting to was related to a call that was reportedly made by Trump to Lee's phone during the Capitol riot. The call was actually meant for Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., and Lee handed his phone to the Tuberville so he could speak with Trump. THESE ATTORNEYS ARE DEFENDING TRUMP IN THE IMPEACHMENT TRIALCicilline claimed that Lee said the content of the call was Trump asking Tuberville to further delay the certification of the election results. But Lee claimed that he had never said such a thing.

(AP Photo/Butch Dill, File) WARREN SAYS REPUBLICANS WHO STAND WITH TRUMP 'MUST BE STOPPED'The story in the Utah-based Deseret News from Jan. 7 that broke the news of the Trump call to Lee that was meant for Tuberville cites Lee as explaining that the call happened. But it does not reveal the content of the call between Trump and Tuberville. A CNN story published the next day claims that Trump was trying to convince Tuberville to make further Electoral College objections, but does not cite that information to either Lee or Tuberville. Notably, however, Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani also during the riot left a voicemail with Lee in which he was explicitly asking Tuberville to delay the certification of the election results. The recording of that voicemail has been widely reported, but there is no such record of the conversation between Tuberville and Trump.  ""Tonight the House impeachment managers made false statements mischaracterizing Sen. Lee’s account of a phone conversation between President Trump and Senator Tuberville,"" a spokesperson for Lee said Wednesday. ""Sen. Lee objected and asked that the false statements be stricken from the record. The House managers agreed to withdraw those statements.""Tuberville told Politico Wednesday that there was not much to his conversation with Trump.""I don’t know if you’ve ever talked to President Trump – you don’t get many words in. But he didn’t get a chance to say a whole lot because I said ‘Mr. President, they just took the Vice President out, I’ve got to go,'"" Tuberville said. ""That’s pretty much what it was.""After several minutes, the senators came to an agreement that would allow them to end the hearing for the night. Lee withdrew his request for a vote appealing Leahy's ruling and Schumer withdrew his quorum call, asking Raskin to make a statement.    In this image from video, House impeachment manager Rep.

Andrew McCarthy: Trump impeachment trial – what you need to ...,2021-02-08 06:00:00," close      Video Andy McCarthy: Trump impeachment exercise in 'political judgement’ Former federal prosecutor, FOX News contributor reacts to assertion by Trump attorney that Senate trial is unconstitutional.So … what exactly is going to happen when the Senate impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump begins on Tuesday? Well, we don’t know for sure. And that’s just the point. See, we are calling the proceeding a ""trial."" Technically speaking, that’s accurate. The Constitution (in Article I, Section 3) instructs that ""The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments."" The House, which has sole power to move for impeachment, has done so, charging the former president with ""incitement to insurrection."" Ergo, it falls to the Senate to try that case. But let’s pause on that. In this extraordinary case, it falls to the Senate to conduct the trial. This notion is largely alien to us. Thousands of trials occur throughout the United States on a daily basis. Yet, those are judicial trials. They are the ones we know. We are very familiar with the high standards of due process to which they must adhere, developed over centuries of Anglo-American law.  JONATHAN TURLEY: IMPEACHING TRUMP – HOUSE THREATENS TO TRASH THIS CORE PRINCIPLE TO ENSURE CONVICTIONIn a criminal case, which is what an impeachment most resembles, the court is the independent institution, ensuring that the accused will not be overwhelmed by the government’s awesome power and resources. A neutral judge presides. The defendant is presumed innocent and need do nothing to prove he is not guilty. The prosecution bears fully the burden of proof. To further even the playing field, the defendant is entitled to counsel, and to discovery of the government’s case, including exculpatory evidence in its files.  Perhaps most significantly for present purposes, the accused is entitled to a fair and impartial jury, and may not be found guilty unless the jury unanimously finds the prosecutor has proved the charge beyond a reasonable doubt. And even if that happens, federal law entitles the accused to multiple rounds of appeal – and if prosecution has somehow transgressed the Constitution or other federal law as they have been interpreted by the federal courts, the conviction will be reversed. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERAll that said, if this is your idea of a trial, and you were to wander into the United States Senate on Tuesday, you could be forgiven for gasping, ""Toto, I have a feeling we’re not in Kansas anymore."" Except, from a due process standpoint, you would not have arrived in a wonderland but a dystopia. It is not enough to say that Donald Trump is not presumed innocent. The word ""presumed"" is utterly out of place. It suggests that there is some set of settled assumptions, similar to judicial due process, that governs a Senate trial. There is not. Again, we can’t be sure what will happen.  More from Opinion Dr. Robert Jeffress: Impeachment -- why America must let go of bitterness to healJason Miller: Trump impeachment trial is unconstitutional – here's why Senate must dismiss itGregg Jarrett: Democrats' impeachment of Trump – here's why this is a lost causeIn fact, until a couple of weeks ago, we did not even know who would preside over this trial. There was speculation about whether it would be Chief Justice John Roberts, who last year sat on the Senate’s first Trump impeachment trial. But there will be no sequel for him. The Constitution only calls for a judicial officer – the highest ranking one in the land – for impeachment of an incumbent president. Trump is out of office ... so we have a trial without a real judge.  Not only does that raise profound questions about the integrity of the proceedings. It also provokes a serious constitutional issue about whether the Senate trial is permissible – in fact, 45 Republican senators contend that it is not.  The main point of impeachment is to remove an official, and Trump is already a former president who obviously cannot be removed. Democrats and some Republicans point out that the Constitution also makes disqualification from holding office in the future a penalty for impeachment, and thus the insist the trial is valid. But if that penalty were intended to apply to former presidents, the Trump legal team counters, the Framers would have mandated that a real, impartial judge preside over the Senate trial. In any event, the ""presiding officer"" will now be Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., one of the chamber’s most notoriously partisan Democrats. If you have a vague memory from civics classes that the vice president of the United States is supposed to preside over Senate proceedings, you’re recalling correctly. But in this instance, Vice President Kamala Harris opted out because the Biden administration is worried that the Senate trial of a president from the opposition party – a trial that, with Trump already out of office, is overwhelmingly opposed by Republicans across the country – already has the appearance of a vindictive, partisan kangaroo court.  You’re thinking that because the proceeding is a ""trial,"" then fairness must be an absolute requirement. But it is not. Having Leahy fill the void in his capacity as the Senate’s president pro tempore is not exactly reassuring from the standpoint of fairness. Ah, but there’s the rub. You’re thinking that because the proceeding is a ""trial,"" then fairness must be an absolute requirement. But it is not. Impeachment is not meant to be fair. It is meant to be political.  That’s not a bug, it’s a feature. Trump’s liberty and property are not at stake – which is when due process requires a judicial trial with all the due process trimmings. Impeachment is a political power the Constitution gives to Congress, a political branch, in order to strip political authority, by removing it or denying it in the future.  Public office is not an individual right; it is a political trust. Depriving a person of eligibility for that trust is a political determination. In our system, it is not something that calls for political judgment, not judicial due process.  VideoLet’s descend from the abstractions of high principle to concrete political reality. In a Senate trial, there is never an impartial jury. Even when the chief justice presides over such trials, his role is merely ministerial. The Senate retains the power to overrule any decision the chief justice makes. Judicial rules and precedent do not control. The presence of a high-ranking judge would simply camouflage the brute fact that the proceeding is political, not legal.  Trump was impeached because Democrats control the House. He will be acquitted because there are not enough Republican votes to convict him. It’s got nothing to do with any legal analysis.  On impeachment, the Framers did not put their trust in law. They relied on politics. They considered assigning impeachment trials to a judicial court; but they opted instead for the Senate – i.e., for the judgment of seasoned statesmen (they were all men back then), who would not ignore legal principles but who would never forget that they were accountable to voters and that, because impeachment is anti-democratic in the sense that it deprives voters of their choice for president, it must be reserved for true emergencies driven by heinous misconduct. Even if Trump’s misconduct was egregious, is this truly an emergency?  The former president’s prospects of returning to power are highly doubtful. Democrats are determined to conduct the trial now, but the Senate could hold it in abeyance until such time, if ever, that Trump mounts a campaign to return to office. That possibility might do more to discourage a 2024 Trump campaign than an immediate trial that will end in a certain acquittal.   VideoNevertheless, the trial will proceed. Because it’s a political process, it is easier to predict the outcome than the process. Maybe there will be a full-blown trial in the well of the Senate. Under the chamber’s impeachment procedures, however, Leahy could assign the matter to a committee – perhaps a body formed ad hoc, or perhaps a standing committee, most likely Judiciary – which could effectively conduct a trial, in which witnesses are called and evidence is presented, but without effectively shutting down the Senate’s work.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIf that happened, the committee would certify the record of its proceedings and disseminate it to the full Senate. At that point, the Senate could decide to supplement the record with additional testimony, or it could just deliberate on a verdict. All of this will unfold starting Tuesday. What it will look like, we can’t be sure. We know only that, though it will be called a ""trial,"" what we’ll be watching won’t be due process. It will be political process. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM ANDREW McCARTHY  Andrew C. McCarthy is a senior fellow at the National Review Institute and a contributing editor of National Review.

The Constitution stipulates that a two-thirds majority must vote for the measure to convict.The Senate is conducting its impeachment trial against Donald Trump on the charge of inciting the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol. The Senate impeachment trial began Tuesday. The House’s Jan. 13 vote impeached Trump 232 to 197 on the charge, with 10 Republicans joining all Democrats. The vote in the House only required a simple majority or 218 votes. CAN THE SENATE STOP TRUMP FROM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AGAIN? In the Senate, it would take 17 Republicans joining all 50 Senate Democrats to convict Trump on the impeachment article, an outcome that is highly unlikely.Last week, Sen. Rand Paul introduced a point of order claiming that it is unconstitutional for the Senate to hold an impeachment trial of a former president.  It was defeated by a 55-45 vote, with five Republicans joining all 50 Senate Democrats, meaning 12 additional Republicans would have to change their position in order for the conviction to succeed. The five Republicans siding with Democrats were Sens.

Proponents say the policy ended a key pull factor that brought migrants north, while critics say it is cruel and puts migrants in danger by leaving them in Mexico.Meanwhile, the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) facilities have been operating far beyond capacity amid a troubling surge in border crossers.

""The last administration left us a dismantled and unworkable system and, like any other problem, we are going to do all we can to solve it."" Asked if the Biden administration has a handle on the unprecedented amount of migrants arriving at the U.S. southern border, Psaki insisted that ""we certainly do.""MCCARTHY, GOP DELEGATION VISITING US-MEXICO BORDER MONDAY AMID MIGRATION SURGE UNDER BIDENDuring Monday’s briefing, Psaki did not say exactly what the previous administration had done to dismantle the system at the border, but she did detail steps the Biden administration is taking to address the influx.She noted that the CDC is rescinding COVID protocols to accommodate the number of migrants at ""full capacity.""""This will help expand capacity to move children more quickly out of CBP facilities,"" she said.Further, it was previously announced that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has been activated to assist with Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) to help with the important task of processing these migrant children to get them out of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CPB) facilities.""There's now an embedding at the president’s ask of HHS and ORR staff with CBP, which will allow [the] government to more quickly ID, vet, confirm sponsors and family members of the unaccompanied minors and will lead to quicker placement,"" she said.  VideoBORDER ENCOUNTERS TOP 100,000 IN FEBRUARY AS MIGRANT CRISIS SPIRALSThe rationale for expediting this process is because ""none of these border patrol facilities are made for children and we want to move them as quickly as possible to shelters and then into homes,"" Psaki said. When asked about messaging aimed at the incoming migrants Psaki responded, ""It's a complicated problem, no doubt about it, we are sending the message clearly in the region, now is not the time to come, but also we want to ensure that people are treated with humanity.""Her comments come as the Biden administration has refused to call the situation a crisis.""It doesn’t matter what you call it. It is an enormous challenge,"" Psaki said last Thursday, before adding: ""We don’t feel the need to, you know, play games with what it’s called.""THE WORD THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WON'T USE WHEN IT COMES TO THE BORDER? 'CRISIS'While numbers have been increasing at the border for months, particularly of unaccompanied children (UACs) and family units, they have spiked since Biden took office. The number of UACs in custody has tripled in recent weeks, while there were more than 100,000 migrant encounters in February.Critics have blamed the dramatic liberalizing of immigration policy and rollback of Trump-era border protections for encouraging the flow and removing the tools that allow migrants to be kept out or returned to their home countries.The Biden administration has claimed it is moving to replace the ""cruelty"" of the prior administration with a more ""humane"" system and warned that will take time. But it has refused to acknowledge that there is in fact a ""crisis"" -- preferring instead to describe it as a ""challenge.""""I think that the -- the answer is no. I think there is a challenge at the border that we are managing, and we have our resources dedicated to managing it,"" DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said last week.Fox News’ Adam Shaw contributed to this report.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.Rep. Elise Stefanik, the favorite to replace Rep. Liz Cheney as the House GOP conference chair, voted with former President Donald Trump less than Cheney and has lower voting scores from top conservative organizations. According to a tool on the FiveThirtyEight website on ""Tracking Congress In The Age Of Trump,"" Cheney, R-Wyo., voted with Trump 92.9% of the time compared to 77.7% for Stefanik, R-N.Y.The conservative group Heritage Action, meanwhile, gave Cheney a 91% score compared to just 56% for Stefanik during the most recent Congress. And the American Conservative Union, which hosted the extraordinarily pro-Trump Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) earlier this year, gives Cheney a 78% rating compared to just 44% for Stefanik. Stefanik, notably, lives in a more moderate district in New York than Cheney, who represents bright-red Wyoming. But Stefanik has still won by more than double-digits every election since 2014, when she first went to Congress.   Rep.

And it reached a boiling point earlier this week when Trump called the 2020 election ""Fraudulent"" in a statement, prompting Cheney to hit back in a tweet. ""The 2020 presidential election was not stolen,"" she said. ""Anyone who claims it was is spreading THE BIG LIE, turning their back on the rule of law, and poisoning our democratic system."" After that, more Republicans began to publicly call for Cheney's ouster and Stefanik eventually began making calls to build support for a potential challenge to Cheney. ""Liz will have more to say in the coming days. This moment is about much more than a House leadership fight,"" Cheney spokesperson Jeremy Adler told Fox News Wedneday.  In this image from video, Rep.

(House Television via AP) TRUMP SUPPORTS ELISE STEFANIK FOR HOUSE GOP CONFERENCE CHAIR AMID LIZ CHENEY FEUD: SOURCESStefanik is highly popular in the Republican conference, as she has a history of helping raise money for other incumbents. She notably also helped a number of House freshman Republican women in the 2020 elections. Stefanik gained notoriety in the past few years as a fierce defender of Trump during the House impeachment hearings in the fall of 2019. She was eventually named the honorary New York chair of Trump's reelection campaign in early 2020, despite her voting record that didn't always align with the former president. But she's stood strongly with Trump in recent months, as the president repeated false claims that he won the presidential election and backed a barrage of failed lawsuits challenging the election results. Stefanik voted with most House Republicans against impeaching Trump for his alleged role in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. Stefanik voted to object to Pennsylvania's Electoral College slate, but did not vote to object to Arizona's electors. Stefanik's office did not return a request for comment from Fox News for this story. Cheney objected to neither slate of electors and then voted to impeach Trump over the Jan. 6 attack. The reason many of Cheney's opponents cite for the fact she should no longer be the conference chair is that she is out of step with most rank-and-file Republicans.   Former President Donald Trump walks on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, Sunday, Nov. 29, 2020, after stepping off Marine One.

""Her role is to lead House Republican messaging, but she is totally unaligned with the majority of our party. We cannot fight for the America First agenda with her in a leadership position.""REP. ELISE STEFANIK BUILDING SUPPORT TO SUCCEED LIZ CHENEY IN GOP LEADERSHIP: SOURCESBut Gooden's 94.5% alignment with Trump, according to FiveThirtyEight, is far closer to Cheney's score than Stefanik's. Gooden, meanwhile, has a 100% score from Heritage and a 71% score from the American Conservative Union. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., told CNN that Cheney is ""really out of step with GOP voters and members."" Hawley has an 83% rating from Heritage, 78% from the American Conservative Union and voted with Trump 86.7% of the time, according to FiveThirtyEight. Others, however, said the increase in sentiment against Cheney was less about votes and more about messaging and Cheney's regular barbs against Trump. ""There's no concern about how she voted on impeachment, that decision has been made. I have heard from members concerned about her ability to carry out the job as conference chair to carry out the message,"" McCarthy said on ""Fox & Friends"" Tuesday. ""We all need to be working as one if we're able to win the majority. Remember, majorities are not given. They are earned. And that's about the message about going forward, combating Joe Biden.""McCarthy continued to say that Republicans should ""all work together instead of attacking one another.""One source told Fox News, ""She continues to raise issues with the former president"" and added that ""if you're out of sync with Trump,"" you're not in sync with the Republican conference.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.Nine of the 10 Republicans who voted to impeach former President Donald Trump over the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol are already facing primary challenges – and some of them may have a very hard time holding on to their seats. Trump vows to work against those Republicans as they run for reelection in 2022, and has already endorsed one primary challenger and signaled there are more to come. ""Instead of attacking me and, more importantly, the voters of our movement, top establishment Republicans in Washington should be spending their energy in opposing Biden, Pelosi, Schumer and the Democrats,"" Trump said in his February CPAC speech. ""Get rid of them all,"" he said of the Republicans who voted to impeach him.   Former President Donald Trump speaks at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), Sunday, Feb. 28, 2021, in Orlando, Fla.

Liz Cheney, R-Wyo.Cheney, the highest-profile Republican favoring impeachment, was the House Republican conference chair when she cast her vote. Cheney, at the urging of Trump and his allies, was eventually deposed from her leadership post but still faces a horde of at least eight primary challengers aiming to remove her from office. State Sen. Anthony Bouchard has raised the most money so far, recently eclipsing $500,000. Bouchard told Fox News that Cheney's impeachment vote ""made it obvious … to everyone"" that ""she has not had a conservative vote in Washington."" Cheney, for her part, has been defiant amid the harsh criticism of her opposition to Trump.   Rep.

""As I said, if they think that they are going to come into Wyoming and make the argument that the people of Wyoming should vote for someone who is loyal to Donald Trump over somebody who is loyal to the Constitution, I welcome that debate.""Other candidates running against Cheney include veteran Denton Knapp, Wyoming state Rep. Chuck Gray and lawyer Darin Smith. Rep. Tom Rice, R-S.C.Rice is also facing a bevy of pro-Trump Republicans gunning for his job. Among the announced candidates are former Myrtle Beach Mayor Mark McBride and state Rep. William Bailey. One of the more unique candidates in the race is Graham Allen, who gained prominence as a right-leaning influencer rather than through holding office. ""I think that President Trump showed the world that you don't have to be a politician to become a politician,"" Allen told Fox News. ""President Trump showed the world that you don't have to be a politician to become a politician."" — Graham Allen, GOP primary opponent to Rep. Tom Rice, R-S.C.""Tom Rice forgot his place,"" Allen added. ""It's Tom Rice's job to be the conduit – that is the voice – of the people that he represents. He did not do that.""Rice told Fox News that he's ""faced challengers in every election. I welcome the opportunity to discuss how I’ve been working every day in Congress on behalf of my constituents.""From broadband investment, infrastructure investment, beachfront renourishment and federal disaster relief, to ensuring our pro-life values and the Second Amendment remain protected from House Democrats, I’m proud to represent the interests of the people of the 7th District,"" Rice added. FORMER GREEN BERET RUNNING FOR CONGRESS GIVES BIDEN AN ‘F’ IN MIDDLE EAST POLICYRep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, R-Wash.Herrera Beutler faces challenges from at least four candidates, including former Green Beret Joe Kent.""Rep. Beutler voted for the impeachment of President Trump based on a false narrative that Trump inspired an armed insurrection against the Capitol,"" Kent told Fox News in an email. ""But the facts don’t matter to the left or Rep. Beutler.""Kent said in an interview with Fox News that part of the reason he supports Trump is because the former president took steps to remove American troops from Syria. He experienced the personal tragedy of America's involvement in the Middle East when his wife, Navy Senior Chief Petty Officer Shannon Kent, was killed in Syria on Jan. 16, 2019.   In this Thursday, Jan. 7, 2021 file photo image taken from video, Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, R-Wash., speaks as the House debates the objection to confirm the Electoral College vote from Pennsylvania, at the U.S. Capitol. On Tuesday, Jan. 12 Herrera Beutler came out in favor of impeaching President Donald Trump over the riot at the Capitol.  (House Television via AP, File) ""I started speaking out in support of what President Trump was doing in the war on terror,"" Kent said. Craig Wheeler, a spokesperson for Herrera Beutler, told Fox News the Republican Party ""needs to focus on presenting conservative solutions to the American people in order to win back the White House, the Senate and the House. That won’t happen if we’re constantly looking backwards, fighting each other and shrinking the tent.""""Jaime continues to be the same conservative, pro-life, pro-strong-border leader who ardently defends the Second Amendment and has opposed every tax increase that’s come before her,"" Wheeler added. ""She remains focused on solving problems for southwest Washington.""Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill.Kinzinger has positioned himself as one of Cheney's closest allies in the fight to de-Trumpify the GOP. It's paid off for him in massive fundraising hauls – he pulled in $2.2 million via his leadership PAC and campaign in the first quarter of this year. Kinzinger's top challenger is Catalina Lauf, 27, who worked in the Trump administration in the Commerce Department. ""I have always understood the tremendous promise of this nation – which is why I proudly served in the Trump White House working to advance President Trump’s pro-jobs, pro-family agenda that delivered historic prosperity and progress for communities across this country,"" Lauf said in a statement. She added that Kinzinger is a ""career politician… warhawk, votes with Democrats on spending and refuses to stand up to the radical left.""Lauf said that as a member of Congress her background in business would lead her to focus on ""pro-growth, pro-business and pro-worker policies."" She also said that her family's background in Latin America makes her appreciate the ""American Dream that has made all of our lives possible is under attack today by radical progressives.""Kinzinger's office did not return a request for comment. Rep. Dan Newhouse, R-Wash.Newhouse came under fire for his impeachment vote and faced calls to resign from Republicans in his district. He has at least three candidates running against him so far, led by state Rep. Brad Klippert and former GOP candidate for governor, Loren Culp. Rep. Anthony Gonzalez, R-OhioGonzalez faces the most well-financed challenger to date in former Trump aide Max Miller, who got the former president's endorsement shortly after announcing his candidacy. KINZINGER CHARGES THAT MCCARTHY ‘FAILED TO TELL THE TRUTH’Miller told Fox News that ""weak Republicans"" like Gonzalez ""need to see the door and have an exit."" Miller said Trump endorsed him because ""he knows that I am not ever going to fold or take a knee, and I will continue to fight for the people and the America First agenda no matter at what cost.""   Former President Donald Trump talks with former Deputy Campaign Manager for Presidential Operations Max Miller, left before his speech to the Republican National Convention on the South Lawn of the White House, Thursday, Aug. 27, 2020, in Washington.

Fred Upton, R-Mich.Upton faced a common form of retribution against the GOP representatives who voted for impeachment – censure by local parties. He's drawn at least five challengers so far, including two sitting officeholders – state Rep. Steve Carra and Berrien County Commissioner Ezra Scott. But unlike some other House members like Cheney, who have been largely marginalized after their impeachment votes, Upton has gained some influence as a vice chair of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus.Rep. Peter Meijer, R-Mich.Meijer is an Iraq veteran who replaced former Rep. Justin Amash in 2020 after Amash left the Republican Party. During his campaign, Meijer racked up endorsements from a number of high-profile Republicans, including Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La. But Meijer's short time in Congress has been largely defined by his impeachment vote, and he's now facing primary challenges from at least three people, including Audra Johnson, known as the ""MAGA bride"" for her pro-Trump wedding dress, and former Sand Lake Village President Tom Norton. Norton said Meijer's impeachment vote ""was a violation of the Constitution"" because it lacked ""due process."" ""If you can violate due process of law for a sitting president of the United States,"" Norton added, those rights could be violated for ""every American."" ""The GOP needs to focus on presenting conservative solutions to the American people in order to win back the White House, the Senate and the House. That won’t happen if we’re constantly looking backwards, fighting each other and shrinking the tent."" — Craig Wheeler, spokesman for Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, R-Wash.Norton noted that he finished in a ""strong"" third place in the 2020 GOP primary for Meijer's seat and believes name recognition could help him win in 2022. ""I was born and raised in the district. I know this district. It's my home,"" Norton said. Meijer and Johnson did not respond to requests for comment. Rep. David Valadao, R-Calif.Valadao was first elected to Congress in 2012 but lost his 2018 race to former Rep. TJ Cox, D-Calif. Valadao ran again in 2020, however, and won back his former seat even as President Biden beat Trump in the district by more than 10 points. But following his vote for impeachment, Valadao is facing a primary challenge from Chris Mathys, an Army veteran and former member of the Fresno City Council. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP""When David Valadao decided to not only vote to impeach President Trump, but he called President Trump un-American and unfit for office, to me it was an act that you just don't do as a conservative Republican,"" Mathys said. Mathys added that his top focus in Congress would be on securing water for his drought-stricken California district. ""The state and federal government have cut us to less than 5 percent,"" Mathys said. ""And some people are getting no water."" Valadao's campaign did not return a request for comment. Rep. John Katko, R-N.Y.Katko is the only Republican who voted to impeach Trump who does not yet have an announced primary challenger. Katko, the ranking member of the House Homeland Security Committee, appeared to get back into good graces with GOP leadership quickly after his impeachment vote. He was one of the faces of a border trip McCarthy took with a group of House Republicans earlier this year. Fox News' Paul Steinhauser, Andrew Murray, Evie Fordham and Joseph. A.

Greg Abbott of Texas and Lone Star State law enforcement and border officials.And slamming Biden, who reversed key immigration policies implemented during the Trump administration, the former president charged that ""now we have an open, really dangerous, border. More dangerous than it’s ever been in the history of our country, and we better go back fast.""ABBOTT JOINS TRUMP AT SOUTHERN BORDER AS HE BECOMES A MAJOR THORN IN BIDEN'S SIDE  Texas Gov. Greg Abbott addresses former President Donald Trump during a border security briefing to discuss further plans in securing the southern border wall on Wednesday, June 30, 2021, in Weslaco, Texas. (Brandon Bell/Pool via AP) Biden has ended many of the restrictive immigration polices implemented by Trump, who repeatedly pledged during his successful 2016 campaign for the White House to build a border wall and make Mexico pay for the construction. Trump made border security a top policy during his administration and in 2019 declared a state of emergency in order to divert federal funds heading to the military to pay for the border wall.Besides halting construction of Trump’s wall, Biden also ended a program that forced migrants to stay in Mexico as they waited for resolution to their U.S. asylum cases, as he aims to follow through on his 2020 campaign pledge for a more humane immigration system.FOX NEWS POLL: HALF SUPPORT BUILDING BORDER WALL Arrests along the southern border with Mexico have surged this year to their highest monthly averages in two decades, with Republicans blaming Biden’s immigration policies for the influx.""We had all these great polices going and they were ended. One day, they were all ended. This didn’t take place over three months or five months. This took place in the first week, they were ended. It was almost like they were ended because I did it,"" Trump argued as he spoke at the briefing in Weslaco, near the southern tip of Texas.""We’re going to admire the wall and how it works,"" Trump said at the end of the briefing as he and Abbott headed out to tour an unfinished part of the border wall.Abbott has pledged to finish construction of the wall in his state. The governor announced a couple of weeks ago steps to stem the flow of migrants illegally crossing the border into Texas – among them are temporary fencing along the border as he pledges to finish construction of the border wall, beefing up the presence of state police at the border, and arresting and jailing people caught illegally trespassing on private property.FOX NEWS POLL: BIDEN APPROVAL HEALTHY BUT UNDERWATER ON IMMIGRATIONSpeaking ahead of Trump, Abbott called the former president ""a great friend to Texas"" who ""stepped up and he secured our border and kept Texas and America safe.""Abbott charged that ""things have changed so quickly and so dramatically under the Biden administration. It has been amazing and disastrous.""""The people of Texas have been pleading for us to be able to step up and help restore safety and security in their lives and is exactly why Texas is stepping up and doing a job that is truly the federal government’s job – a job that you did but a job that the Biden administration is completely failing us on,"" the governor emphasized.

After heavy criticism from Republicans and even a few Democrats, Vice President Kamala Harris – who’s been tasked to steer aspects of the administration’s handling of the immigration crisis – toured the southern border last week.TEXAS SHERIFF REVEALS WHAT HE'LL TELL TRUMP DURING BORDER VISIT""There is one place to solve all the problems on the border and that is on the border and that’s exactly where the Biden administration needs to devote their resources to get the job done,"" Abbott stressed as he jabbed at the White House.After their visit to the border, both Trump and Abbott will join Fox News’ Sean Hannity for a town hall, which will run on Fox News Channel at 9pm ET on ""Hannity.""  Republicans have signaled that they hope to make border security and the wider issue of immigration a key issue in next year’s midterms, as they aim to win back majorities in both the House and Senate.Support for building the U.S.-Mexico border wall is up – and now matches a previous high, according to the results of a Fox News national poll conducted in May. While voters had mixed views on the wall, the 50% who favored it in May matched the record set in 2015 – and the 46% opposed was a new low. The results marked a reversal from a Fox News poll in December 2019, when 44% favored it and 52% were opposed.Border security also appears to be an issue that the current president is struggling with when it comes to public opinion.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPBiden stood at 56% approval and 42% disapproval in a Fox News poll released last week.

"Trump to sue Facebook, Twitter, Google over alleged censorship ...",2021-07-07 11:40:00," close      Video Former President Donald Trump delivers remarks on the First Amendment from New Jersey Former President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced that he will lead a lawsuit over alleged censorship against Twitter, Facebook and Google – three tech companies that removed him from their platforms after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol by a mob of his supporters. The lawsuit will be a class-action, with Trump as the lead plaintiff, claiming that he's been censored by the companies. He spoke about the legal action from his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. ""I stand before you this morning to announce a very important... development for our freedom and freedom of speech,"" Trump said. ""In conjunction with the America First Policy Institute, I'm filing, as the lead class-action representative, a major class-action lawsuit against the big tech giants, including Facebook, Google and Twitter, as well as their CEOs.""""There is no better evidence that big tech is out of control than the fact that they banned the sitting president of the United States earlier this year,"" Trump added. ""If they can do it to me they can do it to anyone."" Twitter, YouTube and Facebook each barred Trump over his false claims that the presidential election was stolen, alleging that he contributed to the violence at the Capitol on Jan. 6.

There were three separate complaints filed in Miami federal court under Trump's name Wednesday, one against each of the social media giants. ""While the social media companies are officially private entities, in recent years they have ceased to be private with the enactment and their historical use of Section 230, which profoundly protects them from liability,"" Trump said. ""It is in effect a massive government subsidy, these companies have been co-opted, coerced and weaponized by government actors to become the enforcers of illegal, unconstitutional censorship."" Trump called social media companies ""the de facto censorship arm of the U.S. government.""He added that ""this was especially clear during the pandemic,"" citing policies against contradicting health experts and the fact that those companies suppressed information alleging that the coronavirus originated in the Wuhan Institute of Virology.   Former President Donald Trump speaks to supporters from The Ellipse near the White House on January 6, 2021, in Washington, DC.

DESANTIS' BIG TECH LAW STRUCK DOWN BY JUDGEShoshana Weissmann of the libertarian R Street Institute, which supports a robust reading of Section 230 to provide broad protections to tech companies, pushed back on Trump's comments. Weissmann said the idea that tech companies ""benefiting from a law prevents them from being private is asinine.""""Government cannot wave a wand and say 'you're public now,'"" she added. ""The idea that this is a subsidy is also nowhere near the truth… And finally, government pressuring companies or companies taking cues from government entities also does not magically turn them into government actors.""""This is a full misunderstanding of how the law works,"" Weissmann said. Trump's lawsuit is going to be led by the America First Policy Institute (AFPI), a nonprofit run by several allies and alumni from the Trump administration.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Good Sunday morning, everyone. Welcome to ""Sunday Morning Futures."" I'm Maria Bartiromo.Today, breaking news, with President Trump still fighting back and rallying back. The 45th president of the United States will join me coming up in an exclusive on his lawsuit against big tech, battling detractors and the questions that will not go away about election 2020.Then, constitutional attorney Alan Dershowitz and Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk on the double standard against Trump and company.Plus, the new timeline out of Afghanistan has communist China waiting in the wings.

We will take you there as more becomes available.More questions, meanwhile, this morning about President Biden's foreign policy agenda, after his surprise announcement on Thursday that the United States will withdraw troops from Afghanistan on August 31, instead of September 11.Joining me right now is former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, also a FOX News contributor.Secretary, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thank you so much for being here.We're waiting on this launch out of the -- Afghanistan. We're looking at the pictures of the Afghanistan base, while we await the launch of the Virgin Galactic.Your thoughts on all of this? I know that you and President Trump created the first space team, the first new military arm since 1947.MIKE POMPEO, FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: So, it's exciting to see what's happening this morning. I wish them well. I hope everybody gets up and gets back and does so safely.What's really going on here is to see American innovation, private sector work. This is all good stuff, creativity. I'm sure they will learn a lot from their continued efforts, not just his company, but others who will come compete for space tourism, and to continue to expand the limits of man's knowledge. That's all good stuff.The really important things that are happening in space are about American national security. And we worked hard on that, not only creating the Space Force, but building out intelligence capabilities and all the tools that America will need in space to be able to defend itself in the next century.BARTIROMO: And now we see our troops coming home by August 31.I want to get your take on how President Biden is approaching this, initially, a September 11 deadline. Now he is taking the troops home. It's not how he's -- that he's leaving, but how he's doing it, the U.S. abandoning its biggest airfield in the country in the dead of night without notifying the base's new Afghan commander.Your reaction?POMPEO: Well, Maria, you hit it on the head.Our mission was twofold. The president gave me a bite -- two pieces of the puzzle. One was to get our kids home. It's the right thing to do. We worked diligently to do that. We went from 10,000, 12,000, 14,000 down to just a fraction of that.But, importantly, we had a diplomatic mission there. And that diplomatic mission was to make sure that America was never attacked from Afghanistan again. And so that was the work. I met many times with Mullah Baradar and his team of the Taliban trying to convince them the right path forward.To move this date around is an odd thing, it seems to me. Maybe it's just they moved out faster. That's all fine. But the devil is in the details. You have to get this right. You have to have the intelligence capabilities.President Trump made clear. He spoke with the Taliban a couple times as well. He made clear to them, if you kill an American, there will be an enormous cost. We will do whatever it takes. We will come back in with the forces we need to come back in with.And it was clear. From the moment we began our conversations with the Taliban in a serious way, we didn't have a single American killed. Indeed, there was only a single attack on an American. It looks like it was a rogue actor. We had the policy right. It's one thing to get out. It's how you do it, how you execute it, and how you implement our global counterterrorism mission in the aftermath of that departure that will make all the difference in whether this ends up being something that President Biden can say, yes, he did it well.BARTIROMO: So, Biden says that he's going to go with his gut, despite military opposition on his plans and credible -- and credible warnings, apparently, according to the military, that Kabul could fall within a few months.Tell me your thoughts on what happens now, as we now understand that China is waiting in the wings to go into Afghanistan.POMPEO: Well, Maria, look, the civilians are in charge. And President Trump had the same kind of resistance from the military as well to reducing our footprint in Afghanistan.It was ultimately his decision, as the leader, to begin this march towards having fewer and fewer troops there in Afghanistan. It's all about how you execute it. Your point about the Chinese is well-taken.Frankly, we provided security for the Chinese for 20 years. Today, there's fewer than 200 Al Qaeda there. That benefits the Chinese enormously. Their interests in Afghanistan are commercial. They're loath to commit their own troops, I expect.And so Afghanistan needs to begin to stand up on its own. I saw some clips last night of fighting-age males who are saying, it's really unsafe, I need to get out. When I see that, Maria, the Afghan people need to decide their nation is worth fighting for and making the case. They need to create a political system and political institutions.You have got Afghan leaders with beautiful homes all over the Middle East, in Europe. There's corruption everywhere. It's time for the Afghan people to do the hard work, the heavy lifting, and demand that they push back against the Taliban, not just militarily, but politically, exercise their own rights, secure their own freedom.We have provided all the resources the Afghan National Security Forces could possibly ever have dreamed of and all the training over two decades. It's time to come back. And it's time to make sure that we do this right with few American troops and making sure that we're never attacked from this place again.BARTIROMO: Well, look, this offers China a portal for the Chinese Communist Party to access the Arabian Sea via Iran, Pakistan. It may very well become an even more dangerous neighborhood, if you will.I want to get your thoughts on what has taken place regarding China this last two weeks, as the CCP celebrates its 100-year anniversary. And Xi Jinping said that China's enemies will have their heads cracked and bleeding in any future conflict.And he vowed to take Taiwan back. Your thoughts in where we are with China, as I am yet to see any policy out of the Biden administration that has any teeth against the CCP?POMPEO: Maria, I haven't seen it either. I truly hope that the Biden administration will pick up the cudgel where the Trump administration left off.After 50 years of the idea of constructive engagement, that we could just sell some more trinkets or manage some Chinese wealth or allow them to come operate here inside America, that they would get political freedoms, it's just failed. The Trump administration turned this around. We began to protect American jobs and create American technology and military force posture in a way that would push back against the very language you saw from Xi Jinping.He is serious about this. We shouldn't take that as bluster. The Chinese Communist Party presents the single greatest threat to the United States of America from external forces, bar none. And we need to mount a sustained, serious campaign to push back against them.This is doable. We have done it with the Soviet Union. We know exactly how to build coalitions around the world. We did it with the Indians, with the Japanese, with the Australians, our good friends and allies. We were beginning to put together a coalition to protect the West.We don't want to live in a world dominated by the Chinese Communist Party. And when you hear Xi Jinping make threats like that, threats to the people on Taiwan, this requires resolve, strength, deterrence from America. And American leadership has to be there.And I hope President Biden will take that up.BARTIROMO: Yes, but you have to wonder if, in fact, the U.S. is there should Xi Jinping invade Taiwan.Look at the response as he invaded Hong Kong and started throwing everybody in jail. The freedom fighters are now in jail.Just this week, communist China seized control of Britain's largest microchip factory. And they also -- the Biden administration announced that more companies will be added to the blacklist over the Xinjiang disaster, where they have Uyghurs locked up.And yet a lot of people are questioning that blacklist, because while he's putting some companies on the blacklist, the companies that are actually doing anything and the subsidiaries of those companies are not on that list.What do you make of these moves this week from the CCP?POMPEO: Yes, the CCP is serious.The moves that you described there this past week are serious, where there were -- there was actions that we saw disclosed about how they're continuing to cover up for the virus as well. We have seen the work they're doing with genetics. They're doing testing on mothers who are pregnant. They're collecting their DNA samples.This is a machine. This is a machine that is intent on dominating the world in technology and commerce and militarily. The responses have to be equally serious. I saw the blacklist that you're referring to. It's pretty technical. It's hard to tell exactly what's in it and what's not.But, in the end, if it doesn't impact a Chinese Communist Party company, if it doesn't impact their capacity to put Americans at risk, then putting their name on a piece of paper is not of any value. They need to do more. The administration needs to do more than just respond to the genocide that we declared.They need to begin to confront them in a serious way and impose real costs on a Communist Party that celebrated its 100th anniversary. And if they're able to celebrate their 200th anniversary, we will live in a very, very different world.BARTIROMO: A very, very different world, as corporate America is yet to get the memo.Two weeks ago, we heard the CEO of Nike say that Nike is of China and for China. Pretty extraordinary stuff.Secretary Pompeo, it's always a pleasure. Thank you, sir.POMPEO: Thank you, Maria. Have a good day.BARTIROMO: And to you.We will take a break and come back and look at the crime wave sweeping the country. Congressman Lee Zeldin is here. He's running for governor of New York. We will find out his platform and get his thoughts on the movement to defund the police, open borders, and put prisoners back on the streets.Stay with us. We have got breaking numbers coming up this morning on the June border apprehensions you will only see here. Back in a minute.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Breaking news this morning.We have brand-new apprehension numbers for the month of June from our source, Brandon Judd, the president of the National Border Patrol Council.Here are the unofficial numbers. They will probably go higher, because this is just up until today.June border encounters nationwide, 174,000 in the month of June, 39,000- plus got-aways. In other words, those people were seen on surveillance. They got away. We have no idea what their intentions are. They are now in America. according to Brandon, these people are going everywhere, Little Rock, Charlotte, Des Moines, and New York City, and Miami both major hot spots for got-aways, Tucson, Arizona, also a real hot spot for got-aways.Joining me right now is Congressman Lee Zeldin. He's a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. He's also running for governor of New York right now.And good morning to you, Congressman.Your reaction to these new numbers, as we expect some of them to go to New York? What can you tell us?REP. LEE ZELDIN (R-NY): It's a staggering crisis at our border right now, reality setting in.We have, as members of Congress, an oath that -- provide for the common defense. We should be funding Department of Homeland Security and ICE and Customs and Border Patrol. We should be strengthening our borders, enforcing our rule of law.And we talk about people who come across our border, but, as you look at those numbers, we also have to take account for the things that come across, the drug trafficking, the arms trafficking, the story behind these numbers. Oftentimes, we're talking about labor trafficking and sex trafficking as well.So it's important for those in government to provide all the resources to law enforcement to do their jobs safely, effectively, because this is not just something that crosses a border, but it's something that quickly spreads to cities and communities all across our country.BARTIROMO: Yes.And, of course, President Trump cleaned all of this up, but the Biden administration overturned it. We're going to speak with the president in just about 30 seconds' time here.But, real quick, what is your plan to turn around what's taking place in New York? You have got murder rates skyrocketing in U.S. cities, 35 percent up in Atlanta, 24 percent up in L.A., Minneapolis up 45 percent, crime also skyrocketing in New York.What is the plan?ZELDIN: Support law enforcement more, not less.Reverse cashless bail here in New York. Keep qualified immunity. Enact a bill of rights for law enforcement that recognizes their inherent right to self-defense, that gives them the resources they need, to ensure they aren't unfairly targeted.I was raised in a law enforcement household. I'm hearing it from all across our state from people from all walks of life.BARTIROMO: OK.ZELDIN: They want to strengthen public safety in our state.BARTIROMO: All right, Lee Zeldin, it's great to see you this morning. Thanks very much.A little abbreviated interview there. We appreciate your time this morning, Congressman. We will keep watching, Congressman Lee Zeldin.And now joining me right now is the 45th president of the United States, Donald J. Trump, on the telephone.And, Mr. President, thank you very much for joining me this morning.DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Well, thank you very much.BARTIROMO: We have been looking at the border numbers and the crime statistics.But I want to get right to your pushback on big tech, Mr. President. You wrote an op-ed after you launched a lawsuit against these major big tech companies.Tell me why this is different. We have been told that social media cannot be sued. So, why is it that you are able to launch this lawsuit against Twitter, Google and Facebook and their CEOs, sir?TRUMP: Well, we're working with the America First Policy Institute, brilliant people, great lawyers. Everybody's so enthused.People are joining because it's a class action. It's not about me. It's about everybody. And people are joining left and right. They're joining at a level that nobody -- I guess they -- I could say this on your show. It's takeonbigtech.com, takeonbigtech.com.And they're joining like -- like, I don't know, I guess probably most of these class actions have never seen before.And what it is, is, they're taking away your freedom of speech. They are taking away your right to speak. They're taking away everything. And they get powers. They have a Section 230, it's called, and that gives them immunity. That gives them protection.But once they have that, they no longer have that kind of a power where you can't go after it. This is a private company. Well, now they're not private companies. They're getting the biggest subsidy. And you can call it that. They're getting the biggest subsidy that any company has ever gotten from a government.I mean, they -- they're immune from so many different things. But they're not immune from this lawsuit, because what they have done is such a violation of the Constitution, a violation like we have never seen before. You look at -- they take me down. They take all conservative voices down, or most of them. If they find them, they take them down.It's a disgrace.BARTIROMO: Now, Mr. President, your lawsuit argues that big tech companies are being used to impose illegal and unconstitutional government censorship. In other words, they are working as agents of the government.We do have information and evidence to show that there was a real conversation going on between Mark Zuckerberg and Dr. Anthony Fauci, for example, during the pandemic. They did censor key information.We had Dr. Kory and Senator Ron Johnson last week to discuss ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, which may very well have been very important treatments for COVID-19. And yet social media censored them.So, tell me about that, because you have got social media working hand in glove with the Democrat Party. Is that what gives you the opening to sue these companies, even though they do have that 230 immunity?TRUMP: Well, that's one of the many reasons.But when you say they work with government, they work with Democrats within government and, frankly, outside of government. They work with the Democrats. It's a Democrat machine. It should be a campaign contribution, the largest ever made.And even on the election, how they helped rig the election, the 2020 presidential election, they have lockboxes all over the place. They bring them in late. They bring them in whenever they want. The boxes are open. Trump has some -- in some cases, virtually no votes within the boxes, like we got no votes.We got 12 million more votes than I got the first time. And they have a lockbox. And people are looking at that left and right.By the way, the investigation going on right now from different states is massive concerning the rigged election of 2020. It was a disgrace. But a big part of that rigging was done by these companies, these very companies that we're suing, on different grounds and on other grounds.BARTIROMO: Yes, I want to get back to that in a moment.But you said these companies are pushing back. And yet I had a list on this program two weeks ago about the biggest lies of all. That includes the Russia hoax, the phony dossier, impeachment with no crime, Hunter Biden's laptop, business deals, the origins and treatment of COVID-19, voting laws in 14 states are Jim Crow.And, of course, they call the armed insurrection -- they called it an armed insurrection, and yet no guns were seized, all of this misinformation to the public. And yet Twitter has restricted the account of a Chinese scholar who dared to mock Xi Jinping.Also, Twitter allows The Global Times, which is Chinese Communist Party propaganda, to come out with a story the other day and recommend that the CCP bomb Australia.How is it possible that these companies that have enriched themselves because of the liberty and freedoms of America to go on and cancel a former president, a sitting president at the time, and allow propaganda from the CCP to run wild and Iranians run wild on Twitter?I don't understand what this motivation is.TRUMP: Well, the motivation is a sick motivation.And, when you look at it, they allow Hamas. They allow countries and dictators that want to destroy everything and everybody and that are doing tremendous harm to their countries, killing people by the thousands. They're allowed.But a president of the United States that has a following like nobody's seen before, we're not allowed to do that. And so we have to use other methods, until this lawsuit is -- it's going to wind its way through the courts. I think it's going to be very successful.It's been -- as you know, it's been very well-received, very popular. A lot of legal scholars are saying, it's about time. So, we look forward to that.BARTIROMO: Mr. President, it is being also reported, though, that this was filed in Miami -- in Florida, rather, and yet the jurisdiction is not right because the terms of service for these social media companies are in California.So, explain that. You filed this lawsuit, class-action lawsuit, in Florida, and yet their terms of service say that this can only be done in California.TRUMP: Well, I filed the lawsuit, and I live in Florida. Florida is my home state. And we filed it, therefore, in Florida.And they would probably like to get it out of Florida. Maybe they will try and bring it into an area where they feel they have total control of everything. And they will try. And our lawyers will be fighting.The fact is, I live in Florida. So it's the obvious place to file it. And we will see what happens on that. But we should be successful.BARTIROMO: Mr. President, you just referred to the 2020 election.I want to refer you to an article in The Federalist over the weekend. And it says new evidence indicates enough illegal votes in Georgia to tip the 2020 results. This is from The Federalist.I want to get your thoughts on what's taking place right now in Arizona and in Georgia with regard to that, as you continue to post and discuss election 2020.TRUMP: That's right.Well, the Federalist, they have 35,000 votes. And that's far more, numerous times more than we need to win that state. But there are many other things in Georgia. Georgia was so corrupt. It was so incredibly corrupt. Frankly, nobody's seen anything like it.And you have a secretary of state, you have a governor that does nothing about it. And they have to get on the ball. But that -- 35,000 votes was -- and this is just one category.If you look at what's going on in Arizona, Arizona has been incredible. The state senators in Arizona have taken it to heart. They're doing an audit, a forensic audit, like you haven't seen really in this country. They're going to be announcing the results. That's done by them. It's not done by me. These are great patriots.They're going to be announcing the results of that audit, Maria, I hear, over the next two or three weeks. And I would imagine it would be horrendous. But we will see. Maybe it'll be wonderful. But we're going to see. It's a very big deal.And this is, again, done by the Senate, the state Senate of a state that looked and they watched, and they saw, wow, we're being scammed. Take a look at Pennsylvania. They're now starting an audit. So many areas. In New Hampshire, they found horrible things in New Hampshire with respect to voting.And we're talking about all determinative. The word is determinative, in other words, things that would overturn. I'm not saying, if you lost by 10,000 votes, and you found three votes of dead people as an example. No, I'm talking about many times the 10,000 votes necessary.We won this election in a landslide. We got 12 million more votes, Maria...BARTIROMO: Yes.TRUMP: ... 12 million more than I got the last time...BARTIROMO: Yes.TRUMP: ... the last time I won.This was a rigged election. And the people aren't standing for it. So, we will go forward.BARTIROMO: Mr...TRUMP: And let's see what happens.BARTIROMO: Mr. President, you know that the Supreme Court would not take any of this up.And, today, we are facing a situation where you're not even allowed to discuss any of this. You get attacked on social media if you raise any irregularities.I want to get your take on where we go from here, because there are 14 states that have come up with new voting laws. Do you think that the current laws on the books and these new laws will ensure a fair and free election in 2022 and 2024?TRUMP: That's right.States like Texas and others have taken it to heart. They saw what happened. They saw the travesty of the election. They know what happened. They were very strong during the election. And we won Texas very easily. But they know exactly what happened.And they have drawn up new laws, many states. I think that you have -- I think it's going to be 41 states are looking at it very strongly, because they saw the travesty of the 2020 election. And we can't have that, where a large percentage of our population and 78 percent of the Republican Party thinks the election was rigged and stolen.We can't have that as a country. We were known for great elections, for honest elections. These elections were so corrupt with the mail-in ballots, and by the thousands, and people getting three, four and five mail-in ballots, just like in New York. Look what happened in New York. And look what happened previously in New York with a congressional race. They never had any idea who won that race.So, this was a terrible blot on our country and our country's history and our country as a free and fair place. This -- you can't allow this to happen. We were very disappointed by the Supreme Court, because they didn't have the courage to take it up. They didn't want anything to do with it.BARTIROMO: Yes.TRUMP: Too controversial.BARTIROMO: That's right.TRUMP: They didn't want anything.The Supreme Court didn't have the courage to take it up. And they should be ashamed of themselves.BARTIROMO: Mr. President, let me move on.The fencing around the Capitol is beginning to come down this week and this weekend. And I know that you have had some time to reflect on what took place on that day, January 6.Talk to us about what you're thinking about as you reflect. What happened that day, from your standpoint?TRUMP: So, there was a big rally called. And, actually, when I say big, who knew? But there was a rally called.And a tremendous number of people, the largest one I have ever spoken before, is called by people, by patriots. And they asked me if I'd speak. And I did. And it was a very mild-mannered speech, as I think has been -- in fact, they just came out with a report in Congress, and they didn't mention my name, literally.But what they were complaining about and the reason, in my opinion, you had over a million people there, which the press doesn't like to report at all, because it shows too much -- too much activity, too much -- too much spirit and faith and love. There was such love at that rally.You had over a million people there. They were there for one reason, the rigged election. They felt the election was rigged. That's why they were there. And they were peaceful people. These were great people.The crowd was unbelievable. And I mentioned the word love. The love -- the love in the air, I have never seen anything like it.And that's why they went to Washington.BARTIROMO: You know, Mr...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: And, by the way, I can tell you that I thought -- because I was hearing from a lot of people there are going to be a lot of people coming there, much bigger than anybody ever anticipated by many times.And I had suggested to the secretary of defense, perhaps we should have 10,000 National Guardsmen standing by. And he reported that, as you know, but I -- we should have -- and he was turned down. I said, it's subject to Congress. They run it. Nancy Pelosi runs it. So, it would be subject to the Capitol Police and the other things, whatever they need.But I said, perhaps you need 10,000, because I think the crowd is going to be very large. Who knows? Maybe two people will show up. But I think it's going to be very large.Anyway, he had that. He went to them. They said it won't be necessary. They were the ones that were responsible. They were the ones. And this came out very loudly in the report.BARTIROMO: Yes, that report showed FBI operatives potentially aware.But there are unanswered questions here. What did the FBI know? Why weren't your Cabinet secretaries briefed? What did Speaker Pelosi know, Chuck Schumer, McConnell?Do you have any answers to that? They continue to call this an armed insurrection.TRUMP: Oh, I think they knew plenty.BARTIROMO: And yet no guns were seized, Mr. President.TRUMP: Right. There were no guns whatsoever.And yet Antifa, which went into Portland and went into so many other places, Seattle -- they took over a big part of Seattle. People died. And there were plenty of guns there, by the way -- and in Minnesota, in Minneapolis. They got -- there was no repercussions for them. And yet they have people still in jail. There were no guns. There were no guns.And, by the way, while you're at it, who shot Ashli Babbitt? Why are they keeping that secret? Who is the person that shot...BARTIROMO: Well...TRUMP: ... an innocent, wonderful, incredible woman, a military woman, right in the head? And there's no repercussions.If that were on the other side, it would be the biggest story in this country. Who shot Ashli Babbitt? People want to know, and why.BARTIROMO: Well, that's right.And I want to talk about that, because Ashli Babbitt, a wonderful woman, fatally shot on January 6 as she tried to climb out of a broken window.Her family has spoken out. Her family has been on ""Tucker Carlson."" And they want answers as far as why this wonderful woman, young woman who went to peaceful protests was shot.Do you have any information? There is speculation that this was a security detail in a leading member of Congress' security detail, a Democrat.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: What can you tell us in terms of who shot Ashli Babbitt? What do you know, Mr. President?TRUMP: So -- so, I have heard that.I will tell you they know who shot Ashli Babbitt. They're protecting that person. I have heard also that it was the head of security for a certain high official, a Democrat.And we will see, because it's going to come out. It's going to come out. What happened to Ashli Babbitt and what's happening currently to people that are incarcerated -- and, you know, it would be one thing if you did that, but why isn't BLM, the death and that destruction that they have caused in Manhattan, in New York, in Chicago, if you take a look at the kind -- in L.A.And look at Minnesota. Look what they did in Seattle. They're not paying a price. In New York, they released 400 people who practically burned down Fifth Avenue and burned down our stores and killed people. And they're all released. They were released. Don't worry about it. We -- you just leave. It was just announced.And yet you have people with no guns that walked down. And, frankly, the doors were open, and the police, in many cases, you know, they have -- they have hundreds of hours of tape, and they're not releasing the tape. They ought to release the tape to see what really happened. But there was also a lovefest between the police, the Capitol Police, and the people that walked down to the Capitol.BARTIROMO: Well...TRUMP: So, I think it's going to all come out.But you have to find out. And you can do it perhaps better than most. And I think I know the answer.BARTIROMO: Well...TRUMP: But who shot Ashli Babbitt? And why are they holding that information back?BARTIROMO: Ashli...TRUMP: And they have to release the people that are incarcerated.They won't do it to the other side.BARTIROMO: It's -- yes, it's actually quite extraordinary.I want you to know that my team reached out to Senator Chuck Schumer's office to check on what he may know about who shot Ashli Babbitt.TRUMP: Right.BARTIROMO: We have not heard back from Chuck Schumer's office.We did send a note and call.TRUMP: I wonder why.BARTIROMO: Yes.What do you think? Do you know who it is, Mr. President?TRUMP: Well, I wonder why. I wonder why.You know, they -- they talk big, and they're real law and order people when it comes to a certain group. But, with another group, they can do whatever they want.Hey, I was in Washington, and I saw what happened. And the repercussions to these people was, like, the people that did damage in these various Democrat-run -- in all cases, Democrat-run cities, there was no repercussion whatsoever. There was nothing. Nothing happened to them.And yet they have people who walked with no guns, with no nothing. They're currently incarcerated. And there's large numbers of them. And it's not right. And they're military people, and they're police officers, and they're construction workers.BARTIROMO: Yes.TRUMP: And they're tremendous, in many cases, tremendous people, tremendous people.Now, we have to find out, why is there a double standard? Why is Antifa, vicious killers, why is Antifa and BLM, which is a scam of the system, why are they set free all the time, never even arrested, never even arrested? Why is it?BARTIROMO: Well, Mr. President, on that day, January 6, you did speak with Kevin McCarthy.Let me just point out that Nancy Pelosi is going forth with a commission to investigate all of this. It may very well be that Kevin McCarthy is called to testify under oath.Do you want to tell us what took place on that phone call?TRUMP: No, I don't have to, because Kevin will speak. And I'm sure Kevin will be very good from that standpoint.But I will tell you this.BARTIROMO: OK.TRUMP: If they're going to do this very partisan investigation, because they couldn't get support to do a straight investigation, a big part of that investigation is the reason that people went to Washington.And that's because of the fraudulent presidential election of 2020. And that has to be a part of it.BARTIROMO: Yes.TRUMP: And everybody that got there, I think, on the one side, those people want to talk about the reason they were there, because, to me, that's the biggest crime of all.We had a corrupt election. We had a rigged election. We had a stolen election. And that's why you had over a million people march to Washington.BARTIROMO: Yes.Mr. President, we are watching on the side of the screen the Virgin Galactic launch about to take place. This is the first crewed spaceflight.I want to point out that, in 2019, you created the first Space Force. This was pretty extraordinary. When you first announced it, you were mocked, of course, by the mainstream media.What do you say as you watch this historic moment, with Richard Branson going into space? You said at the time space is the world's newest warfighting domain, when you created that U.S. armed services unit, a sixth branch of the U.S. armed services, and the first new military service since the Air Force was created in 1947, sir.TRUMP: So, we're very proud of that.It was close to 75 years. It was the Air Force. And now we did Space Force, which is going to be so vital. And we not only did it. I mean, it's up and running and really great. And, as you know, Biden wanted to cancel it. And he was hit so hard that he said, well, we won't cancel it, because this is what we need.Russia has it. And China has it. And they were way advanced over us. And I got it started. The other thing I did is, I opened up NASA again. That was closed. There was grass growing in the cracks of the runway. They were all broken-up runways. There was grass growing through those cracks.And now it's a vibrant, incredible place, which it has to be if we're going to go forward. So, I'm very proud of NASA. And I'm very -- because that was a closed, dead deal. And I'm very, very proud of the Space Force.BARTIROMO: Well, you should be.It's pretty incredible that now you have got Richard Branson going up to space, trying to beat the other billionaire who wants to get there first. And that's Jeff Bezos. Jeff Bezos stepping down as CEO of Amazon recently to focus on these things.Your thoughts on why this is so important to some of these big billionaires, who, of course, have their hands in every other business. Amazon is everything from cloud computing to delivery, to -- of course, Bezos also owning The Washington Post.TRUMP: So, I just say, better them than me.I would rather see Richard in the plane today than me, in the spaceship. But, if -- Richard loves it, and Bezos loves it. And a lot of rich guys love space, OK? You will explain that someday. But they do love space.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: Yes. Well...TRUMP: They love sending rocket ships up.And I made it possible for them to do this. I actually said to my people, let private -- let the private sector do it. These guys want to come in with billions of dollars. Let's lease them facilities, because, you know, you need certain facilities to send up rockets, and we have those facilities. We have the greatest facilities.And I reopened them, because they were -- as I told you, they were dead. They were closed, or essentially closed, for the most part.So, I said, hey, look, if Elon wants to send up a rocket, let him do it. We will get charge him some rent. Let him do it. Let these guys do it.And we're seeing advancement now that I don't believe we would have ever seen had we done it the way -- the old-fashioned way, which we're also using. We're planning on Mars, to go to Mars. You land on the moon, and then you have your pad going to Mars. And all of that's being worked on. And it's very exciting. And a lot of good things are happening.But we also need it for military and for military protection. So, we're doing it for that. I mean, to me, that might be number one, because, when you look at what China is doing, when you look at what Russia is doing.And now, because of what I did, we are leading the pack in space by far.BARTIROMO: We sure are.And the blastoff has happened. Richard Branson now up in the air in his first trip into space, an incredible accomplishment. We are watching this closely. And we, of course, will be reporting on this all day.Mr. President, let me turn now to that double standard that you mentioned a moment ago. Of course, we are watching the news from the Trump Organization and your CFO indicted. Of course, we also see the elements around Hunter Biden doing this new business on selling art, and we're not allowed to know who is buying that art.We don't know if it's a Chinese company tied to the Chinese Communist Party, if it's a Ukrainian company, after he was on the board. And yet your family is under pressure. There are stories this weekend that, given the indictment of the CFO, perhaps your children are also being fingered.What can you tell us about the current state of affairs, sir?TRUMP: I think it's a shame. I think it's a horrible thing that's happening in our country.I have been under investigation since the day I came down the escalator. Between Russia, Russia, and Mueller, and all of these different things I have been under heavy. And they failed totally, no collusion. There was never any collusion. There was never any conversation.The collusion was, frankly, between the Democrats and Russia. And, frankly, it's too bad, when you look at what happens. They use -- they have weaponized this. They have weaponized so many different things. They have weaponized the IRS. They have weaponized things against Republicans, and Republicans haven't done it to them.And what it leads to is, it'll be a big attack the other way also, I guess. Look, how much can Republicans stand? What they are doing, where Hunter Biden gets a billion-and-a-half from China to manage, he gets all of this money from Ukraine, hundreds of thousands of dollars a month to sit on an energy board -- he never had anything to do with energy. He knows nothing.The great one is $3.5 million from Russia from the wife of the mayor of Moscow. What was that? I mentioned that in debate. Your friend -- your friend Chris Wallace would not let me ask that question. He said, that's irrelevant.Well, it's not irrelevant.But the beauty of them all is, he's going to get a half-a-million dollars a painting. And he never painted before. He's not an artist. He's never painted. This is just the payoff. And, already, they're trying to say, well, isn't it lovely? He's a painter.There is such a difference, such an incredible difference. I was president. I took no salary. It cost me a lot of money being president. And I always knew it would. But all of those things that they have done -- and the whole deal is very simple.I got 75 million votes, the most of any sitting president. Polls today show me way ahead of everybody, not only Republicans, against any Democrat.BARTIROMO: Yes.TRUMP: They want to do anything they can to stop that.These are dirty players. And it shouldn't happen. It's a disgrace.BARTIROMO: All right, so, the question is, will you make the run again?You said that you know your answer, but you're not revealing it yet. You ready to get back in that ring and run for president again, sir?TRUMP: Well, I do know my answer, but I can't reveal it yet, and -- because that has to do with campaign financing and everything else. You know that.So, I can't reveal it yet. But I absolutely know my answer. And we're going to do very well. And people are going to be very happy.And, look, I look at cable ratings. I look at the ratings of CNN. They're down 79 percent.BARTIROMO: Yes.TRUMP: MSDNC is down 64 percent.I mean, what's going on?BARTIROMO: Yes. All right.TRUMP: I think they're going to come out and endorse me. They will endorse Donald Trump pretty soon, I think.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: Mr. President, it's good to catch up with you this morning, sir. Thanks very much.TRUMP: Thank you, Maria. Thank you very much. Bye.BARTIROMO: All right, we will see you soon.President Trump joining us there live.We're going to take a break and come back with Charlie Kirk and Alan Dershowitz to respond.Back in a moment.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back to a jam-packed ""Sunday Morning Futures"" this morning.Joining me right now with reaction to what we just heard from President Trump are constitutional scholar Alan Dershowitz, the author of ""Cancel Culture: The Latest Attack on Free Speech and Due Process."" Also here is Charlie Kirk, the president and founder of Turning Point USA.Gentlemen, it is a pleasure to see you.Alan, kicking it off with you, let me get your thoughts on the merits of President Trump's case against big tech.ALAN DERSHOWITZ, ATTORNEY: Well, it's always uphill to try to sue private companies.But here you have private companies that are trying to suppress freedom of speech. So you have private companies using the First Amendment as not a shield to protect the marketplace of ideas, but as a sword to close the marketplace of ideas.I anticipated this problem six months ago. And I wrote another book called ""The New Censorship, "" the case against the new censorship.What's the new censorship? The old censorship was the government suppressing free speech. That was easy to defeat. I won the Pentagon Papers case, the Chicago Seven case, the Hair case, all of the cases involving the old censorship.The new censorship is when private companies that have the benefit of Section 230 use their power, their monopoly power, their duopoly power, their triopoly power to try to close the marketplace of ideas to different ideas.So, this is an important case. It was a very important case to see how the Supreme Court will resolve the conflict between using the First Amendment to suppress speech and free speech itself.Justice Thomas has already indicated that he might well regard these giant companies in a way that permits regulation. And so we will see if there are other justices as well.But what no one can deny is, this is an important matter in America, big companies using the First Amendment to suppress free speech. And the radicals on the left who say this is not an important case simply don't know what they're talking about.BARTIROMO: Charlie, real quick on this story before we move on.CHARLIE KIRK, FOUNDER, TURNING POINT USA: Yes, with the big tech issue, I'm very pleased to see the president play offense on that.And we have been saying for quite a while that if we do not have the ability to speak online, then many of the promises of the First Amendment and our government's promise to protect our right to speech are completely invalidated.We have a parallel government in Menlo Park, California, and it's time that we start to hold them accountable.BARTIROMO: And how about the right for privacy and freedom?I'm going to take a break and then get your take on Tucker Carlson's revelation that the NSA has been spying on him, reading his private e- mails. How many others are getting their constitutional rights violated?We will be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back.We're with Charlie Kirk and Alan Dershowitz.Charlie, I want to get your take on who fatally shot Ashli Babbitt. What do you know?KIRK: Yes, we're still in the allegedly phase, but, according to RealClearPolitics and RealClearInvestigations, it looks that -- it looks like it's -- we're pretty certain to believe that it's a man by the name of Lieutenant Byrd, Michael Byrd.And there's more information that's going to come out around this, I think, in the coming weeks and months.But isn't it interesting, Maria, about every single one of these nationalized and politicized tragic police incidents, almost within days, we know the police officer involved, we have body camera footage, we know the history behind it. And all the activist groups call for the resignation of that person, and possibly even charges around that person.And, here, you have an unarmed veteran that went into the Capitol and got fatally shot. And a lot of people talk about January 6 as saying that it was a tragic day where people died. The only death that we know of that day where someone was murdered was the death of Ashli Babbitt.It is time that we get answers from our government. And the fact that they are remaining silent on this is very, very suspicious. And if Nancy Pelosi is actually serious about finding the truth of January 6, why doesn't she find the truth of the one murder that we know that happened of an unarmed veteran that went into the Capitol?BARTIROMO: So the one fatality happens at the hands of a security detail of a leading Democrat?KIRK: That's what it looks like.Again, I want to say allegedly, because we don't want to jump to anything, but it's pointing that way. The investigative work from RealClearPolitics is very convincing. And the fact that the government is not flat out denying it and they're almost avoiding the question goes to show that it's all but certain that it is this person.We're going to wait until we're 100 percent sure. But, again, we need to get an answer of who killed Ashli Babbitt, an unarmed veteran who went into our Capitol Building and was murdered by her own government.BARTIROMO: Again, we reached out to Chuck Schumer's office. We have not heard back.Real quick on the NSA reading Tucker Carlson's e-mails, Alan Dershowitz, your reaction real quick?DERSHOWITZ: It's unconstitutional for the government to read people's e- mails without a FISA warrant.We need to get information to see whether or not they got a FISA warrant, whether the FISA warrant was based on accurate information. Any time an American has his e-mails read without due process, there's a problem, under the Fourth Amendment.BARTIROMO: Yes.DERSHOWITZ: So, let's get to the bottom of it.BARTIROMO: All right.And, again, we have not confirmed the name of the shooter, but we are investigating.Thank you, gentlemen. Extraordinary times we are living on. And I am honored to cover it with you.I will see you this week on ""Mornings With Maria"" on FOX Business.Content and Programming Copyright 2021 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Trump easily wins CPAC 2024 GOP presidential nomination straw ...,2021-07-12 02:35:00," close      Video Former President Trump to speak at CPAC GoPac Chairman David Avella and former DNC deputy press secretary Jose Aristimuno share their expectations for the president's speech.DALLAS – Former President Donald Trump easily won the 2024 GOP presidential nomination poll at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) gathering this weekend in Texas.Trump, who’s repeatedly flirted with making another presidential run in 2024 to try and return to the White House, captured 70% of ballots cast in the anonymous straw poll, according to results announced by CPAC on Sunday afternoon.That's a boost from the 55% support he won in the hypothetical 2024 Republican primary matchup straw poll at CPAC Orlando in late February.""I want to personally thank each and every one of you for your incredible support,"" Trump said as he gave the Dallas event's keynote address minutes later.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis came in a distant second, at 21%. No one else among the 19 potential 2024 Republican White House contenders topped 1%. TRUMP SPEECH, STRAW POLL RESULTS, PUT 2024 GOP PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION IN CPAC SPOTLIGHT  The results of the 2024 GOP presidential nomination straw poll at CPAC Dallas, which were announced on July 11, 2021 in Dallas, Texas. DeSantis, a first-term governor and Trump ally who soared in popularity among conservatives nationwide for his resistance to lockdowns and COVID restrictions amid the coronavirus pandemic, easily topped a second 2024 ballot question – without Trump on the hypothetical ballot.DeSantis grabbed 68% support on that question, with former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at 5%. Donald Trump Jr. and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas were both at 4%, with South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem at 3%. No one else topped 2%.The straw poll results, along with the former president’s headliner speech on Sunday, were the most anticipated moments at the three-day gathering of conservative activists and leaders from across the country.Trump’s strong performance comes as no surprise. CPAC, long the largest and most influential gathering of conservatives, has become a Trump-fest since his 2016 presidential election victory.

Among the topics on the secret ballot, which organizers say will give them a sense of the pulse of the conservative movement, are critical race theory, cancel culture and border security. But the 2024 straw poll questions, without a doubt, generated the most interest.At the straw poll at CPAC in Orlando, DeSantis, who finished in second place with 21% support, was the only other Republican to reach double digits.DeSantis topped the second straw poll question in Orlando, which didn’t include Trump, finishing with 43% support in the hypothetical nomination showdown, with Noem second at 11%.CLICK HERE TO FOR A 30 DAY FREE TRIAL OF FOX NATION WITH CODE 'CPAC'Fox Nation is a sponsor of CPAC and will be streaming live speeches from the most influential conservatives at CPAC 2021: America Uncanceled.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.EXCLUSIVE: Karoline Leavitt, the 23-year-old former spokeswoman for House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik and former assistant press secretary for former President Trump, is running for Congress in the First Congressional District of New Hampshire, vowing to serve as the ""conservative firewall"" between the Granite State and Democrats in Washington.Leavitt, who was born and raised in Atkinson, N.H., returned to the Granite State last month from Washington, D.C., to ""step into the arena and fight.""She's one of several Republicans aiming to unseat Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas, who has represented the district since 2019. Pappas won reelection in 2020 by five points in a battleground district that could see an infusion of GOP voters after once-in-a-decade redistricting, which the Republicans control in New Hampshire.Republicans Tim Baxter, a first-term member of the New Hampshire House, Gilead Towne, and Julian Acciard have also announced their candidacies. Matt Mowers, who unsuccessfully challenged Pappas in 2020, is reportedly mulling running for the seat again.The First Congressional District covers some of the southern and eastern portions of the state and includes Manchester, the state's most populous city. HOUSE DEMS UNLOAD ON BIPARTISAN INFRASTRUCTURE NEGOTIATIONS IN PRIVATE CALL: REPORT""I’ve been spending every day criss-crossing the state and the district and listening to voters who are my friends, my family and my community who I grew up with,"" Leavitt told Fox News.

Across our country, conservatives don’t feel like their voices are being heard. It drove me to run.

Who is Adam Kinzinger? Conservative congressman turned anti ...,2021-07-25 15:03:00," close      Video Kinzinger slams McCarthy for failing 'to tell the truth' about Jan. 6 attack on Capitol Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., argues House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy lied to Americans regarding details of the January 6 attack on the CapitolThe news on Sunday that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will appoint Rep. Adam Kinzinger as the second Republican representative on the special House committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol is once again putting the congressman from Illinois in the national spotlight.Kinzinger made headlines at the beginning of this year as one of the most high profile of the 10 House Republicans to vote to impeach then-President Trump for his role in inciting the deadly attack on the Capitol by right wing extremists and other Trump supporters bent on disrupting congressional certification of now-President Biden’s Electoral College victory.PELOSI TAPS KINZINGER TO SERVE AS SECOND REPUBLICAN ON JAN. 6 INVESTIGATION PANELBut Kinzinger, one of the most well-known Republican critics of Trump on Capitol Hill, has been making headlines for over a decade.Kinzinger joined the Air Force after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, serving in both the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. He’s currently a lieutenant colonel in the Air National Guard. As a 32 year old, he was first elected to Congress in the Tea Party wave election of 2010, beating a Democratic incumbent by nearly 15 points in a north central and north eastern Illinois district, thanks in part to Sarah Palin’s endorsement. Two years later, after redistricting, he took down 10-term GOP Rep. Don Manzullo in the primary before winning the general election.While he’s drawn praise from Democrats for his anti-Trump language, Kinzinger doesn’t come close to aligning with the Democrats on policy. He’s long opposed the Affordable Care Act, best known as Obamacare, opposes increasing taxes, and advocates against abortion rights. Kinzinger was never a Trump loyalist, but the attack on the Capitol magnified his opposition to the then-president.KINZINGER HAULS IN BIG BUCKS AFTER FACING TRUMP'S WRATH OVER IMPEACHMENTThe storming of the Capitol occurred soon after Trump urged a large crowd of supporters he addressed at a rally near the White House to march to the Capitol and show strength in protesting the certification of the election.The then-president was impeached by the House a week later on one count of inciting an insurrection. Ten Republicans – including Kinzinger – joined all 222 Democrats in voting to impeach Trump, with 197 Republicans voting against impeachment. In February, after leaving the White House, Trump was acquitted in a Senate trial, with 7 GOP senators joining all 50 Democrats in the chamber to vote to convict the former president.In an interview with Fox News earlier this year, Kinzinger lamented that ""today's Republican Party is not the one I joined.""KINZINGER CHARGES THAT HOUSE GOP LEADER MCCARTHY ‘FAILED TO TELL THE TRUTH’""The party that always spoke about a brighter tomorrow no longer does. It talks about a dark future instead. Hope has given way to fear. Outrage has replaced opportunity. And worst of all, our deep convictions are ignored. They've been replaced by poisonous conspiracies and lies. This is not the Republican road and now we know exactly where new and dangerous road leads. It leads to insurrection and an armed attack on the Capitol,"" he argued.Trump reshaped the Republican Party during his four years in the White House and ruled over it with an iron fist. And six months removed from his presidency, Trump’s sway over the GOP hasn’t diminished.Kinzinger stressed that ""Republicans must say enough is enough. It's time to unplug the outrage machine, reject the politics of personality and cast aside the conspiracy theories and rage.""""The future of the GOP is on the line,"" he emphasized. ""Let's take back our party.""  Representative Adam Kinzinger, a Republican from Illinois, speaks during a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Wednesday, Sept. 16, 2020. Photographer: Kevin Dietsch/UPI/Bloomberg via Getty Images The now 43-year-old Kinzinger, who was easily reelected last November, is facing half a dozen primary challenges, including one from a Republican who named his campaign committee ""Impeach Adam Kinzinger 2022.""CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPBut Kinzinger’s stance against Trump has boosted his fundraising. His reelection campaign’s hauled in nearly $2 million during the first half of this year, and he has more than $3 million cash on hand. And the Country First Leadership PAC, which he formed earlier this year to support other anti-Trump Republicans, is also bringing in big bucks.Kinzinger will join Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming as the two Republicans on the panel investigating the insurrection. Cheney, the most high profile House Republican to vote to impeach the then-president, was stripped of her House GOP leadership position in the spring for her anti-Trump sentiments.

  A little less than a year ago, a significant number of independent and Republican voters decided to trade bad tweets for bad policy. Today, your Twitter feed is void of President Trump's tweets. But the price was high.  Gone are the good policies that drove the Trump economy and made the world a safer place. In their place are policies antithetical to prosperity, freedom and security. You traded energy efficiency for dependency on the Middle East. Whereas a year ago you enjoyed inexpensive gas, high paying energy jobs, and fewer incentives to entangle ourselves in Middle Eastern politics, today President Biden is begging OPEC to produce more oil. Apparently, his climate agenda can handle more oil production as long as Americans aren't the ones profiting from it. SEN. JONI ERNST: CRISIS IN AFGHANISTAN – BIDEN MUST BE CLEAR ABOUT THREAT, NEVER FORGET US TROOPS' SACRIFICESYou traded an energy pipeline out of Canada for a crime pipeline out of Mexico. Instead of creating jobs for skilled American workers, Biden is creating opportunities for cartels, traffickers and COVID-positive migrants. By the end of 2021, according to New Mexico Rep. Yvette Herrell, the number of undocumented and illegal migrants welcomed across our borders by the Biden administration will be equivalent to the population of her whole state – about 2 million people.   Trump said no to federally funding abortion.

  The progressive crusade to bring down Donald Trump by any means necessary continues to damage the Office of the President and the Constitution’s separation of powers. New York prosecutors succeeded in subpoenaing a sitting president — and thereby interfering with his ability to carry out his duties — all for the sake of indicting a single Trump Organization official for under-reporting taxes.  Now the Biden administration has inflicted even more damage on the Presidency by waiving Trump’s constitutional right to confidential communications with his closest aides.On January 23, 2021, Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats sent a letter to the Department of Justice demanding production of documents concerning meetings and communications between Trump and high-ranking Justice Department officials regarding election fraud.  House and the Senate committees subsequently followed up with subpoenas for a slew of top former Justice Department officials, such as Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, assistant attorney general Jeffrey Clark, and U.S. Attorneys in Georgia and New York.   VideoIn normal times, the Justice Department would immediately reject these demands.  Article II of the Constitution specifies, after all, that the President ""may require the Opinion"" from his principal officers ""upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective offices."" TRUMP FORESHADOWS EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE FIGHT IN ELECTION INVESTIGATIONS, BUT WON'T TRY TO BLOCK TESTIMONY YETEver since President George Washington refused to share documents with the House about the Jay Treaty, the Executive Branch has asserted the need to keep confidential documents and information that reflect presidential decision-making and deliberation. In Nixon v. United States, the Supreme Court recognized that the President must enjoy an executive privilege in order to receive the full and frank advice of top officials in order to effectively discharge his constitutional duties.More recently, the D.C. federal court has recognized that ""history and legal precedent teach that documents from a former or an incumbent President are presumptively privileged.""  The Supreme Court has only recognized an exception when a criminal defendant’s own constitutional right to information conflicts with the President’s right to confidentiality. Then—and only then—has the Court sought to balance the two competing rights by intruding only as necessary on the claim of privilege. VideoCongress’s demands for documents and subpoenas for testimony are more far-reaching and much more destructive to the separation of powers.  While Congress has a right to investigate the events leading to the terrible riot of January 6, it does not have a right to override the constitutional prerogatives of an independent branch of government.  KEVIN MCCARTHY: BIDEN EVICTION MORATORIUM WAGING WAR ON SMALL BUSINESSES AND 'BREAKING THE CONSTITUTION'If Congress has the right to demand presidential documents and discussions at will, it could just as easily force the Justices of the Supreme Court to reveal their deliberations about the electoral fraud cases brought after the November 3 elections, too.  Imagine the howls from Capitol Hill if the Trump Justice Department had issued subpoenas to Nancy Pelosi to obtain internal documents and communications between her and her top legislative advisors about threat assessments provided in the run-up to the January 6 joint meeting of Congress.  DOJ SUES TEXAS OVER ABBOTT ORDER ON COVID-CARRYING MIGRANTSTo make matters worse, the Biden administration has waived any claim of privilege enjoyed by Trump and his top advisors.  The privilege belongs to the incumbent President, it asserted, with barely a nod to the threat to the internal deliberations of all future presidents, and with little heed to the Supreme Court’s finding that the privilege extends to former as well as incumbent presidents.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERThe Department’s new position, which appears to be based on political animosity toward the former president, is a terrible (and in our view unconstitutional) idea. That privilege exists not for the personal benefit of a president as an individual but for the benefit of the Republic.  As the Carter administration argued in a 1977 case dealing with President Nixon’s presidential papers, ""Unless [the President] can give his advisers some assurance of confidentiality, a President could not expect to receive the full and frank submissions of facts and opinions upon which effective discharge of his duties depends."" The privilege must extend beyond a president’s tenure lest all future Presidents find their top advisors unwilling to provide the full and candid advice necessary for effective policymaking.More from Opinion Rep.

Bush (R).  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPShould the Department’s politically-motivated waiver of privilege go unchallenged, we can expect to see tit-for-tat waivers every time a new administration from a different political party comes into office.  Such political ""gotcha"" is hardly conducive to resolving our political divide, and will likely exacerbate it to the point of undermining our political institutions.The Department of Justice needs to withdraw its waiver of executive privilege, and if it does not, the former president needs to assert it himself and, if need be, litigate to protect the executive privilege not just for himself but for future presidents—the long-term good of the Republic demands no less.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JOHN YOO  John C.

Unemployment may not return to Trump lows: Fed official | Fox ...,2021-08-26 13:58:00,"   close      video KC Fed president on Jackson Hole, inflation, tapering measures Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George, in a wide-ranging exclusive interview, argued that tapering should happen 'sooner rather than later' and predicted 'high growth' for the U.S. economy this year. The U.S. unemployment rate may not return to the more than half-century lows recorded under former President Donald Trump, according to Esther George, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. The national unemployment rate is currently at 5.4%, a pandemic-era low, but remains elevated from the 3.5% that was reached under Trump. Many workers remain on the sidelines due to generous unemployment benefits, the closing of schools and day care, and fears over the virus. ""I'm not necessarily wedded to saying a pre-pandemic number will represent full employment because one of the things we know is that the pandemic shock could have had real impacts on the way we work,"" George told FOX Business’ Edward Lawrence.   The Federal Reserve’s dual mandate calls for the central bank to achieve maximum employment and price stability. However, the central bank last year said it would allow inflation to run above its 2% target ""for some time"" in order to achieve its employment objective.  FED'S GEORGE SAYS IT'S TIME TO START TAPERING ASSET PURCHASESThe Fed as recently as 2019 thought a 4.1% unemployment rate represented ""full employment."" That was until Trump’s tax cuts and deregulation helped the U.S. economy, before the pandemic, achieve its lowest unemployment rate since the 1950s. The policies helped achieve record low unemployment for Asians, Blacks and Hispanics.      Source: FactSetIn April 2020, the unemployment rate skyrocketed to a record high of 14.8% as nonessential businesses were forced to close their doors in order to help slow the spread of COVID-19. Workers have been returning to the labor market amid a reopening of the economy, but policies put in place by the Biden administration have limited job gains. Biden extended the extra $300 per week in supplemental unemployment benefits until September, something Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell admitted is having an impact on people returning to work.  He said at his press conference on July 27 that the rolling off of ""very generous unemployment benefits"" and other factors should result in ""strong job creation."" Other Biden policies, like the president’s assault on the oil industry, are also impacting the labor market. Oil-producing states like Texas (6.2%), New Mexico (7.6%) and Alaska (6.6%) all have unemployment rates well above the 5.4% national average as Biden’s policies have limited production and increased reliance on OPEC. GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HEREThose policies, and other factors, including the state of the reopening of schools and day care, the child tax credit, and proposed corporate tax hikes, could make it even more difficult for the Fed to achieve maximum employment as labor force participation is likely to remain uncertain. ""I think we should aim for trying to get that unemployment rate as low as we can,"" George said.

And Trump has issued a flurry of statements the past couple of days, going as far as arguing that it’s time for the president ""to resign in disgrace.""CLICK HERE FOR LIVE FOX NEWS UPDATES ON THE AFGHANISTAN EVACUATIONTrump struck a deal with the Taliban in February of last year that called for all U.S. troops to depart Afghanistan by May 2021. Trump, during his watch, reduced U.S. forces to their lowest level in Afghanistan in two decades. And last year the Afghan government released thousands of Taliban prisoners, many of whom likely once again took up arms against the U.S.-backed forces.But rather than reversing the Trump Afghanistan roadmap – as he did with plenty of other Trump policies – the president carried out the deal that was struck last year, overruling the opinions of his top military commanders.On Monday, Biden spotlighted that ""when I came into office, I inherited a deal that President Trump negotiated with the Taliban. Under his agreement, U.S. forces would be out of Afghanistan by May 1, 2021, just a little over three months after I took office.

Trump big tech suit lawyer predicts case headed to Supreme Court ...,2021-08-30 10:46:00," close      Video Fox News Flash top headlines for August 30 Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.EXCLUSIVE – The top lawyer for former President Donald Trump in his lawsuits against Twitter, Google and Facebook over his bans from those platforms says that multiple factors make them ""state actors,"" meaning they'd be legally vulnerable under standards normally applied only to governments, like prior restraint. In an exclusive interview with Fox News that lawyer, John Coale, argued that the government is essentially deputizing social media companies to censor Americans. And he predicted that the Supreme Court will eventually decide the case. ""The basis for all of this case is that private companies cannot be empowered by the government via Congress, via [Section] 230,"" to censor people, Coale said. ""The Biden administration and members of Congress can't delegate what they cannot do themselves.""He added: ""This issue will in the end be decided in the Supreme Court, it's that important.""  Attorney John Coale speaks next to former U.S. President Donald Trump at Trump golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, U.S., July 7, 2021.  REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz (REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz)READ IT: TRUMP LAWSUITS AGAINST TWITTER, FACEBOOK, GOOGLE OVER ALLEGED BIG TECH CENSORSHIPIn addition to the initial complaints, Coale and his legal team last week filed a motion for a preliminary injunction against Google – which owns YouTube – to force the company to allow Trump back on its platform. In all of those documents the main thrust of the Trump team's arguments is that the companies can be treated like the government in law because they are allegedly taking actions based on pressure, encouragement or willfully in concert with the government. They cite cases that allegedly support this, although they are not perfect fits for facts as the examples are mostly not in the context of speech rights. ""There's three tests and if they flunk one test, they're government actors,"" Coale said. ""The first is if ... government officials be they congressmen, senators or people in the executive branch threaten these companies – they did it at congressional hearings, they did it in the media and we show examples of that in the preliminary injunction.""""The other thing is, if the government encourages censorship that is unconstitutional,"" Coale added. ""The third test is if ... the private company is doing the bidding of the government, and they are. We had Biden’s press secretary confirm that last month when she said that they're working closely with Facebook to prevent misinformation on the virus.""Last week's motion for a preliminary injunction includes several examples of alleged pressure, encouragement and cooperation between the company and government officials.   Former President Donald Trump speaks at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., Wednesday, July 7, 2021. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig) (AP Photo/Seth Wenig)TRUMP TO SUE FACEBOOK, TWITTER, GOOGLE OVER ALLEGED CENSORSHIP, SAYS THEY'VE ‘CEASED TO BE PRIVATE’Among those examples are comments and proposed bills from members of Congress like Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., taking a touch stance against alleged social media misinformation. There are also examples of members of Congress calling for social media bans of the former president and lauding them after the fact. Trump's lawyers also say that the social media companies' allegedly inconsistent application of their standards reduces their protection under doctrines like Section 230. The motion highlights comments made by Democrats on social media platforms that Coale and his team argue are similar to or worse than comments by Trump, revealing an inconsistent application of standards. One of the examples is a June 2018 comment from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., asking why there ""aren't uprisings all over the country"" over the treatment of children on the southern border. Another is a 2020 comment from Vice President Harris, then a senator, condemning violent protests but saying that protests over police brutality are ""not going to let up – and they should not.""Despite the confidence from Coale that the Supreme Court will hear and decide the case, most experts believe Trump's case is legally dubious. They say it is simply impossible for a company to violate a person's constitutional rights because the Constitution does not apply to private entities – and by extension, a principle like prior restraint cannot be applied to private companies either. ""I don't think the lawsuit has much chance of success because it first and foremost accuses the companies of violating the U.S. Constitution, and the U.S. Constitution only restricts government,"" Vanderbilt Law School professor Brian Fitzpatrick told Fox News when Trump's lawsuits were first filed in July. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP""All of us benefit in some way from some law but that does not transform all of us into the government,"" Fitzpatrick added about arguments that the companies are state actors because of certain government actions, in particular their benefits from Section 230. ""It has zero chance of success. I think it's mainly for publicity, it's not to get real relief in a court.""""Government cannot wave a wand and say 'you're public now,'"" Shoshana Weissmann of the libertarian R Street Institute told Fox News at the time as well. ""[G]overnment pressuring companies or companies taking cues from government entities also does not magically turn them into government actors… This is a full misunderstanding of how the law works.""Coale told Fox News his team is likely to file motions for preliminary injunctions against Twitter and Facebook as well over their bans of the former president. Any appeals from the lawsuits, which are filed in district courts in Florida, would go to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. Then any emergency appeals from there would go to Justice Clarence Thomas based on geography. There is a strong chance that the litigation could drag on for years, especially as Trump continues to weigh a run for president in 2024.   Tyler Olson is a for Capitol Hill Producer for Fox News in Washington, D.C.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.753, 'pos': 0.247, 'compound': 0.5574}",34,152.0,0.08855555555555555,0.8248888888888889,0.08633333333333333,-0.0315375,0.076,0.836,0.088,0.9313,-1.072275,4.022002777777778,112.0,0.03591073908730159

The Trump administration in February of last year struck a deal with the Taliban that called for all U.S. troops to depart Afghanistan by May 2021. Trump, during his watch, reduced U.S. forces to their lowest level in Afghanistan in two decades. And last year the Afghan government released thousands of Taliban prisoners, many of whom likely once again took up arms against the U.S.-backed forces.NEW MISSION FOR AFGHANISTAN WAR VETS RUNNING FOR CONGRESS: EVACUATION AFGHANS WHO HELPED U.S.But Biden, who reversed many Trump polices upon taking office in January, didn’t scrap Trump’s agreement with the Taliban, although he extended the U.S. withdrawal deadline to the end of August. An email this weekend from the Save America PAC argues ""Make no mistake: this is Joe Biden’s failure and his alone.""TRUMP PLANNING IOWA STOPTrump says that he’ll return to Iowa for the first time since the 2020 election.A trip by Trump to the Hawkeye State, whose caucuses for half a century have kicked off the presidential nominating calendar, will fuel even more speculation over the likelihood of a third straight White House run by the former president.Trump indicated his intentions to return to Iowa during an interview last week on the ""Todd Starnes Show.""

Milley 'aided and abetted' the enemy if he back-channeled China 'Outnumbered' co-host reacts to reports Gen. Milley sought to undermined former President Trump on 'Fox News Primetime'EXCLUSIVE: Former acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller, who led the Pentagon from the period after the 2020 election through Inauguration Day, said that he ""did not and would not ever authorize"" Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley to have ""secret"" calls with his Chinese counterpart, describing the allegations as a ""disgraceful and unprecedented act of insubordination,"" and calling on him to resign ""immediately.""In a statement to Fox News, Miller said that the United States Armed Forces, from its inception, has ""operated under the inviolable principle of civilian control of the military."" MILLEY SPOKESMAN DEFENDS CALLS WITH CHINA AS 'VITAL' TO 'AVOIDING UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OR CONFLICT'""The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is the highest-ranking military officer whose sole role is providing military-specific advice to the president, and by law is prohibited from exercising executive authority to command forces,"" Miller said. ""The chain of command runs from the President to the Secretary of Defense, not through the Chairman."" Miller went on to reference the allegations, which are included in the book ""Peril,"" co-written by Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Robert Costa, that Milley made two secret phone calls, both to his Chinese counterpart, Gen. Li Zuocheng of the People’s Liberation Army. The book alleges that the phone calls took place prior to the 2020 presidential election, on Oct. 30, 2020, and then two days after the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, on Jan. 8, 2021.  The book claims Milley contacted Li after he had reviewed intelligence that suggested Chinese officials believed the United States was planning an attack on China amid military exercises in the South China Sea. The authors of the book also claim Milley contacted Li a second time to reassure him that the U.S. would not make any type of advances or attack China in any form, as Milley promised, ""We are 100% steady. Everything’s fine. But democracy can be sloppy sometimes.""But Fox News spoke with multiple individuals who were in the room during the two phone calls Milley had with Li. The calls, in October, were coordinated with then-Defense Secretary Mark Esper’s office. ""They were not secret,"" a U.S. official told Fox News about the calls, which took place over video teleconference. Fox News has learned there were about 15 people present for the calls. Sources told Fox News that there were multiple notetakers present, and said the calls were both conducted with full knowledge of then-Defense Secretary Mark Esper and then-acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller – something Miller denied. ""If the reporting in Woodward’s book is accurate, it represents a disgraceful and unprecedented act of insubordination by the Nation’s top military officer,"" Miller said, adding that if the story of Milley’s ""histrionic outbursts and unsanctioned, anti-Constitutional involvement in foreign policy prove true, he must resign immediately or be fired by the Secretary of Defense to guarantee the sanctity of the officer corps.""   National Counterterrorism Center Director Christopher Miller testifies at a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing on ""Threats to the Homeland"" on Capitol Hill on Sept. 24, 2020 in Washington, D.C.

""President Trump absolutely believed and advocated for a more aggressive approach to China, but he was elected to end our Nation’s wars, not start new ones.  I was proud to play a small role in achieving those goals."" Miller added: ""I look forward to a full, non-partisan investigation of the accusations made by Woodward to guarantee that the genius of our Founders and following generations that established a system and culture of the subservience of our military – the most powerful force in our Nation – to civilian control endures."" And former chief of staff for the Department of Defense Kash Patel told Fox News that ""the law governing the Joint Chiefs of Staff specifically forbids the chairman from exercising any operational command authority."" ""Congress put this in the statute because the U.S. military is to be led by a civilian, the commander-in-chief,"" Patel continued. ""Furthermore, by law, the national command authority goes from the president to the secretary of Defense to include anything relating troop deployments, operations in theaters of war, and nuclear command."" MILLEY CALLS WITH CHINESE COUNTERPART 'WERE NOT SECRET': US OFFICIALSPatel added that if the calls with China are true, Milley ""has violated the law regarding operational authority."" ""Calling a foreign counterpart and discussing operational capabilities against that enemy is literally treasonous,"" Patel said. ""The White House, nor the Office of the Secretary of Defense authorized the chairman to conduct any calls with Chinese officials regarding operations.""And deputy chief of staff to the Department of Defense Joe Francescon also told Fox News that it was ""the policy at the time that there was no senior government engagement with China, owing to their bad acts and efforts."" Francescon added that it was the ""blanket policy at the time not to have high-level engagement with the Chinese on matters like this,"" and added that Miller and his office were ""not told in advance of any call to the Chinese specifically."" ""At most, they were presented that Milley was calling foreign allies and partners to reassure them,"" he said. But spokesman for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Col. Dave Butler is defending allegations of ""secret"" calls with his Chinese counterpart, saying the conversations are ""vital"" to ""reducing tensions"" and ""avoiding unintended consequences or conflict,"" maintaining that the calls were coordinated with high-level defense officials. ""The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs regularly communicates with Chiefs of Defense across the world, including with China and Russia. These conversations remain vital to improving mutual understanding of U.S. national security interests, reducing tensions, providing clarity and avoiding unintended consequences or conflict,"" Milley spokesman Col. Dave Butler said in a statement Wednesday. Butler said that Milley's calls ""with the Chinese and others in October and January were in keeping with these duties and responsibilities conveying reassurance in order to maintain strategic stability."" ""All calls from the Chairman to his counterparts, including those reported, are staffed, coordinated and communicated with the Department of Defense and the interagency,"" Butler said.""Also in keeping with his responsibilities as senior military advisor to the President and Secretary of Defense, General Milley frequently conducts meetings with uniformed leaders across the Services to ensure all leaders are aware of current issues,"" Butler continued. ""The meeting regarding nuclear weapons protocols was to remind uniformed leaders in the Pentagon of the long-established and robust procedures in light of media reporting on the subject."" Butler added: ""General Milley continues to act and advise within his authority in the lawful tradition of civilian control of the military and his oath to the Constitution.""Meanwhile, a U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity, maintained that Milley routinely calls his Chinese and Russian counterparts, and explained that he has been speaking to Li for about five years. The source said this is normal for the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  VideoAccording to the official, there was full civilian oversight of the phone calls, including a representative of the State Department and Milley’s political adviser. Notes of the calls were taken and a summary note was sent to the Defense secretary and the intelligence community, the official said. ""This was not done like some sort of conspiratorial thing,"" another participant who overheard the conversation told Fox News. According to those familiar, the October phone call had several topics, one of which focused on the election. The Chinese, according to the sources, were concerned about, what they saw as, instability in the U.S. system. Milley, according to a source, reassured his counterpart that the U.S. is a stable democracy. Another source said the call was in the context of assuring adversaries that the United States were not planning any military action. Fox News has learned that Milley had up to 20 phone calls with Li and NATO allies in the wake of the Jan. 6 riot in an effort to reassure them that the U.S. government was stable, and to reassure China that the U.S. did not plan a surprise attack – all in an effort to lower tensions with China during the interim period between the election and inauguration, and to project stability so that adversaries of the U.S. did not take advantage of the domestic turmoil during that period. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe White House is also defending Milley, with White House press secretary Jen Psaki saying the President ""has worked side-by-side with Chairman Milley for almost eight months as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs has experienced with him has been that he is a patriot.""""He is somebody who is is has fidelity to the Constitution and he has confidence in his leadership. And the role he has played in his experience with him,"" Psaki said. ""I can't speak to Anonymous, unconfirmed reports about prior conversations during the last administration."" Psaki added that the president ""knows Gen.

House votes to hold Trump ally Steve Bannon in contempt | AP News,2021-10-21 17:13:00," close      Video Steve Bannon on fraud charges: ‘They’re not gonna shut me down’  Former White House adviser Steve Bannon on being charged with fraud, the upcoming presidential election and big tech’s political influence. The House voted Thursday to hold Steve Bannon, a longtime ally and aide to former President Donald Trump, in contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena from the committee investigating the violent Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection.In a rare show of bipartisanship on the House floor, the committee’s Democratic chairman, Mississippi Rep. Bennie Thompson, led the floor debate along with Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, one of two Republicans on the panel. Still, the vote was 229-202 with most GOP lawmakers voting ""no,"" despite the potential consequences for Congress if witnesses are allowed to ignore its demands.The House vote sends the matter to the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington, where it will now be up to prosecutors in that office to decide whether to present the case to a grand jury for possible criminal charges.The partisan split over Bannon’s subpoena — and over the committee’s investigation in general — is emblematic of the raw tensions that still grip Congress nine months after the Capitol attack. Democrats have vowed to comprehensively probe the assault in which hundreds of Trump’s supporters battered their way past police, injured dozens of officers and interrupted the electoral count certifying President Joe Biden’s victory.Lawmakers on the investigating committee say they will move swiftly and forcefully to punish anyone who won’t cooperate with the probe.""We will not allow anyone to derail our work, because our work is too important,"" Thompson said ahead of the vote.

The special congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection has set a vote for Tuesday to recommend criminal contempt charges against Bannon after he defied the panel's subpoena. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, file) Republicans call it a ""witch hunt,"" say it is a waste of time and argue that Congress should be focusing on more important matters.Indiana Rep. Jim Banks, leading the GOP opposition on the floor, called the probe an ""illicit criminal investigation into American citizens"" and said Bannon is a ""Democrat party boogeyman.""Cheney and Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger are the only two Republicans on the Jan. 6 panel. Both have openly criticized Trump and his role in fomenting the insurrection, even as other Republicans have mostly remained silent in the face of Trump’s falsehoods about massive fraud in the election. Trump’s claims were rejected by election officials, courts across the country and by his own attorney general.JAN 6. COMMITTEE RECOMMENDS BANNON FACE CRIMINAL CONTEMPT FOR DEFYING SUBPOENAThe Jan. 6 committee voted 9-0 Tuesday to recommend the contempt charges after Bannon missed a scheduled interview with the panel last week, citing a letter from Trump’s lawyer that directed him not to answer questions. The committee noted that Bannon did not work at the White House at the time of the attack, and that he not only spoke with Trump before it but also promoted the protests on his podcast and predicted there would be unrest. On Jan. 5, Bannon said that ""all hell is going to break loose.""Lawmakers on the panel said Bannon was alone in completely defying its subpoena, while more than a dozen other subpoenaed witnesses were at least negotiating with them.""Mr. Bannon’s own public statements make clear he knew what was going to happen before it did, and thus he must have been aware of -- and may well have been involved in -- the planning of everything that played out on that day,"" Cheney said ahead of the vote. ""The American people deserve to know what he knew and what he did.""  FILE - In this Jan. 6, 2021 file photo, violent protesters, loyal to President Donald Trump, storm the Capitol in Washington.

It’s a decision that will determine not only the effectiveness of the House investigation but also the strength of Congress’ power to call witnesses and demand information.While the department has historically been reluctant to use its prosecution power against witnesses found in contempt of Congress, the circumstances are exceptional as lawmakers investigate the worst attack on the U.S. Capitol in two centuries.Attorney General Merrick Garland gave no hints during a House hearing on Thursday.""If the House of Representatives votes for a referral of a contempt charge, the Department of Justice will do what it always does in such circumstances. It will apply the facts and the law and make a decision consistent with the principles of prosecution,"" he said.Democrats are pressuring Justice to take the case, arguing that nothing less than democracy is on the line.""The stakes are enormous,"" Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin said in an interview with The Associated Press.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIf the Justice Department doesn’t prosecute, the House has other options, including a civil lawsuit. That could also take years but would force Bannon and any other witnesses to defend themselves in court.Another option would be for Congress to try to imprison defiant witnesses — an unlikely, if not outlandish, scenario. Called ""inherent contempt,"" the process was used in the country’s early years but hasn’t been employed in almost a century.The lingering acrimony over the insurrection, and the Bannon subpoena, flared Wednesday at a House Rules Committee hearing held to set the parameters of Thursday’s debate. Under intense questioning from Raskin, Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Republican who defended Trump and opposed the Bannon contempt effort, said he accepted that Biden is the president but would not say that Biden won the election.Raskin said, ""I know that might work on Steve Bannon’s podcast, but that’s not going to work in the Rules Committee of the United States House of Representatives, Mr. Gaetz.

The book notes that Collins emailed Fauci in April of 2020 saying any claims of a laboratory leak of the virus was a conspiracy.""The email was titled ‘conspiracy gains momentum’ and it included a link to on-air comments by Fox News host Bret Baier that multiple sources had told him the virus may have originated in a Wuhan laboratory before accidentally escaping. Perhaps the leadership at the NIH viewed this as innocent international collaboration,"" the book states. WSJ BOARD HITS DEMS, MEDIA ON AVOIDING GAIN-OF-FUNCTION RESEARCH ACCOUNTABILITY: 'INEXCUSABLE'""​​If so, this was naive. The United States was well aware of the inherent risks of the type of dual-use research in which Xi Jinping was engaging. It seemed the health, science and even defence community turned a blind eye to these grave national security and biosafety concerns, along with China’s blatant theft of American intellectual property.""Markson also spoke to Trump-era Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who did not name Fauci in his comments but made clear he blamed the NIH and other U.S. health officials for funding going to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.   President Donald Trump and Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, listen as Larry Kudlow, White House chief economic adviser, speaks about the coronavirus in the James Brady Briefing Room, Tuesday, March 24, 2020, in Washington.

""It seems like that raises an awful lot of questions about the absence of oversight and the risks that pertain to that.""The book also details that senior White House officials were shocked to learn that Fauci had lifted the ban on gain-of-function research back in 2017, and ""they were even more astounded to discover he knew so much about the research in Wuhan, but never said a word as the pandemic unfolded.""Trump’s acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, who was present for all meetings during the early stages of the pandemic, ""said Fauci did not once mention the gain-of-function research that his agency had funded at the Wuhan Institute of Virology,"" according to the book. ""I do not recall him saying anything of the sort, and certainly not that he may have been involved with it,"" Mulvaney told Markson. ""I was surprised to recently learn of the connection. Honestly, I wish I had known about it, as it clearly would have registered as a possible source of bias in Fauci’s contributions to the debate. Put another way: I knew Navarro hated the Chinese, so I knew to take his input on, say, the travel ban, with a grain of salt. I did not know of Fauci’s involvement in the research in China. That certainly would have impacted the weight we gave to some of his contributions.""WAPO'S JOSH ROGIN: ‘FAUCI WAS WRONG’ ABOUT DENYING NIH FUNDED WUHAN ‘GAIN OF FUNCTION’ CORONAVIRUS RESEARCHWhile Fauci did not tell top Trump administration officials about funding gain-of-function research, emails released through a FOIA request showed Fauci was concerned about the NIH funding such projects, the book states. ""Fauci was clearly concerned in the very earliest days of the outbreak that his agency had funded gain-of-function work at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, maybe even funding the laboratory that caused the pandemic. He had cause to be extremely worried, given scientists were telling him Covid-19 may have been genetically altered,"" Markson writes. Fauci has denied funding such research that creates new deadly viruses and was even grilled by Sen. Rand Paul about the funding over the summer. ""You take an animal virus and you increase its transmissibility to humans. You’re saying that’s not gain-of-function?""

(Fox News )Duncan stressed that ""our job now as Republicans is to harness all of the good that we've done over the years, all of those great policy positions that make sense for a majority of Americans, and then self-evaluate the things that we need to improve. What can we do better.""""With just a few course adjustments…I believe the GOP can get back on track,"" Duncan predicted.The former college baseball star and minor league pitcher turned heath care executive - who served as a Georgia state lawmaker before his 2018 election as lieutenant governor - grabbed national attention in the weeks after the 2020 election for speaking out against then-President Trump’s unfounded claims of ""massive voter fraud."" MORE THAN THREE-QUARTERS OF REPUBLICANS WANT TRUMP TO RUN AGAIN IN 2024""I was doing all the due diligence that I could to figure out if there was any systemic fraud in that election, and the answer every day was no. We never could find any fraud.

Duncan, along with Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and GOP Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, resisted Trump’s requests to overturn the election results in the Peach State.""I was very aggressive early and often in speaking against the fraud,"" Duncan said. But his public push back in national interviews against Trump led to threats against him and his wife, which necessitated protection by state troopers.The path Duncan is currently taking is perilous, because nine months removed from the White House, Trump remains very popular with most Republican voters and extremely influential with GOP politicians. The former president continues to play a kingmaker’s role in party politics and teases another presidential run in 2024. But he also continues to re-litigate his 2020 loss to Biden and pushes for election audits in numerous states across the country.""The reality is that Donald Trump has a zero percent chance of ever being the president of the United States again,""  Duncan argued. ""It will continue to become more and more obvious to folks across the country that this is an unwinnable strategy, this divisive rancor, this divisive tone that alienates is not a winnable strategy.""Duncan predicted that ""there's not going to be this overwhelming groundswell for election fraud and conspiracy theories and divisive rancor. Republicans are going to wake up across this country and just simply want to win. And I think GOP 2.0 can do that. What we're seeing is a short term sugar high in Donald Trump. And I guarantee you beyond a shadow of doubt that Trump fever is going to break.""""Certainly we hope that this happens before 2024,"" Duncan stressed. And he said that ""GOP 2.0 wants to be there to pick up the pieces, to really take that leadership role in how we move forward, how we truly, genuinely go back to inspiring a nation instead of talking down to a nation.""While Duncan looks to a post-Trump GOP, there's no let up right now in the former president's immense clout over the Republican Party. Trump continues to headline major party functions and fundraisers, and at his large rally in Iowa earlier this month, the top leaders of that state's GOP establishment all attended and spoke in support of the former president.TRUMP CRITIC GEOFF DUNCAN DECIDES AGAINST 2022 REELECTION AS GEORGIA LIEUTENANT GOVERNORDuncan announced in May that he wouldn’t run for reelection next year. As Kemp and Raffensperger seek reelection in 2022, they’re facing Trump’s wrath. The former president has already endorsed a primary challenger against Raffensperger and has been seeking to recruit a candidate to take on Kemp. But Duncan said that the prospect of being on Trump’s most wanted list wasn’t his reason for not seeking a second term.""I want to have a much needed conversation with America and if I'm running for reelection and trying to do the things I need to do to win a primary and a general in Georgia, I can't have that conversation that needs to happen now,"" he explained.The location of Duncan’s kickoff event for GOP 2.0 raised eyebrows, as the New Hampshire Institute of Politics is a must stop for White House hopefuls in the state that for a century’s held the first primary in the presidential nominating calendar. Duncan touted that ""we intend for GOP 2.0 to play a significant role in shaping who the Republican nominee is.""But would the list of potential 2024 Republican presidential contenders include Duncan?""There's a lot of work to be done between here and 2024 to heal and rebuild the party.

The lease deal could ultimately fetch closer to $400 million, which would represent roughly a doubling of the money the Trump Organization spent to convert the government building into a luxury hotel, said one of the people familiar with the matter. KISS BASSIST GENE SIMMONS SELLS LOS ANGELES HOME FOR $16 MILLIONThe hotel sales talks have been heating up as Democratic-controlled House committees have been investigating and holding hearings on potential conflicts of interest and emoluments issues surrounding Mr. Trump.The House Committee on Oversight and Reform has been examining the lease terms between the Trump Organization and the federal government’s General Services Administration for use of the Old Post Office. The deal predates Mr. Trump’s entry into national politics, but the committee is probing how well Mr. Trump managed conflicts of interest while president.A Friday report from the House committee said the hotel lost more than $70 million between its opening in 2016 and last year, leading the company to inject at least $24 million in aid.The Trumps have disputed those findings, though their government filings show a slowdown in business. The hotel generated about $150 million in revenue over four years, according to Mr. Trump’s financial disclosures while president. His most recent disclosure, which covered all of 2020 and the first few weeks of 2021, showed the hotel’s revenue fell to $15 million, compared with $40 million in 2019.GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE The Washington, D.C., hotel has been a jewel in the Trump family portfolio. In 2012, the Trumps beat out some of the most experienced and deepest-pocketed names in the lodging business, including Marriott International Inc. and Hilton, for the rights to the lease.The family’s pledge to spend about $200 million renovating and converting the 19th century post office into a modern luxury hotel was the highest offer, say people familiar with the matter.About two years ago, the Trumps decided to test the sales market for the hotel’s lease. The family initially hoped it could sell the lease for close to $500 million, a person familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal at the time.During the Trump years in the White House, the hotel became something of a Republican clubhouse, attracting fans, lobbyists, lawmakers and others with business before the Trump administration.That business has fallen off since he left the White House, but hotel analysts suggest that the hotel’s prime location and 19th century architecture make it a unique destination.""It’s an older building that has undergone extensive renovations, but it has design characteristics and architectural detail you can’t replicate today,"" said Sean Hennessey, chief executive of Lodging Advisors, a New York hospitality consulting firm. ""If it becomes affiliated with a luxury brand, that brand can create a new identity for the property.""CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESSCGI Merchant Group was among roughly a dozen firms to express interest in the property, according to a person familiar with the matter, including pension funds, foreign government funds and high net-worth individuals.The GSA, which manages the government’s real estate holdings, would be involved in the approval process for any sale of the lease, according to its contract with the Trump Organization.The Miami-based CGI is part of a new breed of investors focusing on more socially conscious investing. The firm has pledged that properties in its Conscious Certified Hotels collection, which includes the Gabriel and Celino South Beach in Miami Beach, will donate 1% of all room revenue to local nonprofit organizations, according to the company’s website.CGI founder and Chief Executive Raoul Thomas has donated to political causes, including more than $72,000 to President Biden’s campaign and the Democratic Party during the 2020 election, fundraising records show.

Trump says migrant caravan 'must be stopped' as it moves through ...,2021-10-27 18:06:00," close      Video Migrant caravan chants 'yes we can' en route to US border Rep. Tony Gonzales criticizes the Biden administration's policies for 'encouraging' migrants to make the trip to the southern border.Former President Donald Trump on Wednesday said that a migrant caravan making its way from the south of Mexico to the U.S. border ""must be stopped"" – as the numbers of migrants in the massive group are said to have gone above 4,000.""I hope everyone is watching the MASSIVE Caravan pouring through Mexico and headed to our Country,"" Trump said in a statement. ""This must be stopped before they reach our Border, or before.""MIGRANT CARAVAN CONTAINING THOUSANDS TRAVELS THROUGH MEXICO TOWARD US BORDER: ‘TELL BIDEN WE ARE COMING’ The caravan is on its fifth day of travel, having set off on Saturday with about 2,000 migrants and already broken through a line of Mexican interior enforcement. The organizers have used QR codes to organize migrants – marking the latest attempt to form a caravan of migrants to travel to the U.S. borderOrganizer Luis Garcia said that the caravan is approximately 4,000 strong with more than 400 children between the ages 7-18, 100 babies under the age of one. It also included 65 pregnant women (three more than eight months pregnant) and four wheelchair bound migrants.The caravan consists of migrants from Central and South America as well as Haiti and other countries. Thousands of migrants predominantly from Haiti overwhelmed the Del Rio Sector last month -- with 15,000 migrants camped under the bridge at one point.Some of the migrants making this journey have cited President Biden as they make their journey north.""Tell Biden we are coming,"" one migrant named William from El Salvador told Fox News.""President Biden, we need your help,"" another said. VideoUnlike the caravans that made headlines in 2019, this one will take considerably longer. The Mexican government has banned truckers from letting migrants hitch a ride, so they will have to walk the entire 2,500 miles to the Texas border.TENS OF THOUSANDS OF MIGRANTS GATHERING AT SOUTHERN BORDER AHEAD OF ‘REMAIN IN MEXICO RESTART' SOURCES SAY The Biden administration has blamed root causes in Central America for the massive crisis at the southern border -- which saw more than 1.7 million migrant encounters at the border in FY 2021 and more than 192,000 encounters in September alone. It has also blamed the Trump administration for shutting down legal pathways to asylum.However, Republicans have blamed the rolling back of Trump-era policies like border wall construction and the Remain-in-Mexico policy -- which the Biden administration is reluctantly reinstating due to a court order after a lawsuit from Texas and Missouri.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPOn Wednesday, Trump contrasted the current border crisis with what he said was a more secure border at the end of his presidency.""Just nine months ago, we had the strongest Border in our Nation’s history,"" he said.

Biden's stumbles might boost a Trump comeback—without election ...,2021-09-30 03:06:00," close      Video Biden agenda in jeopardy  As press covers Democratic impasse For months now, most of the energy on the left, and in the media, has been consumed by whether Donald Trump could steal the next election.From the Jan. 6 fallout to voting rights restrictions, from Trump’s pronouncements of a rigged election to the Arizona audit that showed a Biden victory, the question looming over most political coverage is whether the former president could pull off in 2024 what he failed to do this time around.But slowly, subtly, a new debate is starting to emerge: What if Joe Biden’s mounting mess means Trump could legitimately win back the White House?Now on one level it’s absurd to ask that question eight months after a new president has taken office. A million things will change just between now and the midterms. Biden may dig his way out of trouble, especially if he can break the paralysis in his own party and start passing bills.MILLEY ADVISED BIDEN AGAINST AFGHAN PULLOUT, DENIES USURPING TRUMP’S AUTHORITYBut it’s a revealing discussion because of the automatic assumption that fraud would be Trump’s only ticket back to the Oval. (To be sure, while Trump would be a virtual lock for the GOP nomination if he runs, he would carry considerable baggage from the Capitol riot and his refusal to accept the 2020 results.)In the Atlantic, anti-Trump conservative David Frum says flatly that ""the troubles of the Biden administration could empower Senate, House, and state Republicans to restore Donald Trump to office."" Frum, a Bush White House speechwriter, runs through issues that he thinks Biden is bungling, from the border to the economy, and says:""Democracy is genuinely on the ballot in 2022 and 2024, as it was in 2016, 2018, and 2020. But this time, so too are prices, borders, and crime. If the Biden administration cannot deliver better on those issues than it has so far done, Trump and his enablers will be just as happy to scoop power by default as to grab it by stealth or force.""The Washington Post is still warning about the prospect that ""Trump and his supporters emerge in 2024 more sophisticated and successful in their efforts to steal an election."" But citing a CNN poll that 7 in 10 Republicans believe Biden didn’t win the election, the paper says:  ""One side’s nightmare scenario — Trump running in 2024 and reclaiming the presidency — represents to the other side simply the democratic system working as it should.""In other words, most Republicans believes there is a different kind of Big Lie, which the media have adopted as shorthand for Trump’s unproven claims that the 2020 election was the most corrupt in our nation’s history. While many will find the prospect of a twice-impeached president pulling a Grover Cleveland implausible, he did garner 74 million votes last year—and of course needs only to win the Electoral College.One reason Biden especially appears to be struggling right now is that he doesn’t seem to have control of his own party. Biden met three times on Tuesday with Krysten Sinema, who along with Joe Manchin is blocking a deal on the gargantuan, $3.5-trillon Democratic spending bill. Bernie Sanders, AOC and other progressives are so determined to pass that measure that they’re holding the bipartisan infrastructure bill hostage. Nancy Pelosi wants an infrastructure vote today, but given the liberal cries of betrayal, she’ll need some Republican votes to get it through.With no one quite able to divine what Machin and Sinema want, Biden is mostly playing a behind-the-scenes role that makes him look like a bystander. Axios quotes an official familiar with the president’s thinking as saying ""he’s not gonna beg. His view is: 'You're Democrats, and you're with your president or you're not.’""SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIESAs a career Senate man, Axios says, Biden believes ""that presidents should demand outcomes rather than details.""Behind closed doors yesterday, says Politico, a ""furious"" Nancy Pelosi ""chided roughly half a dozen moderates who are privately threatening to tank a measure to hike the debt limit, which they see as a pointless political maneuver with the Senate GOP firmly opposed.

Plus, Alex Murdaugh arrested for alleged fraud. President Joe Biden is being slammed on social media for clips circulating online from the 2020 campaign trail in which he blamed food shortages on failed leadership from then-President Donald Trump.""We don't have a food shortage problem — we have a leadership problem,"" then-candidate Biden said in May of 2020 during a virtual town hall while blaming Trump for food shortages during the coronavirus lockdowns.TOP WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL RETWEETS POST CALLING INFLATION, SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES ‘HIGH CLASS PROBLEMS’""We have plenty of food,"" Biden added. ""It's being plowed under. You've got-- you're euthanizing cattle and pigs. They're out there making sure that they're pouring thousands of gallons of milk into the ground. It's not a food shortage. It's a lack of leadership-- a lack of leadership.""Biden added that if he were president at the time he would have ""ordered the government to buy food from farmers and send it to food banks"" and that Trump ""failed to step up"" by not doing that. TUCKER CARLSON: INFLATION IS NOT A TEMPORARY PROBLEM, IT IS REAL AND IT IS HERE""I'd harness the restaurant industry to help get food to those who need it and help get millions of laid off workers back to work and the job...this is not rocket science.

Key raw materials needed for construction and components such as semiconductors are in short supply, while a labor shortage has contributed to a shipping logjam at major ports. Several major companies have noted higher logistics-related costs and disruptions to their normal operations. The issues have also impacted consumers in the form of empty shelves and higher prices, prompting fears that lower spending will slow the economic recovery.Food prices jumped 0.9% last month and are now up 4.6% annually, according to the index. The price for meats, poultry, fish and eggs soared 10.5% this year, with beef prices climbing a whopping 17.6%. Fruits and vegetables rose by 3%. For Americans earning the median annual income of about $70,000, inflation has forced them to spend an extra $175 a month on food, gas and housing, the New York Post reported last week, citing Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. Earlier this week, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that the supply chain ""challenges"" were ""inevitable.""Fox News' Talia Kaplan and Thomas Barrabi contributed to this report  Andrew Mark Miller is a writer at Fox News.

"Trump says 'hats off' to Special Counsel Durham, predicts ...",2021-11-08 09:59:00," close      Video The Durham Investigation Drops a Bombshell The ‘Russian collusion narrative’ came from Washington.Former President Trump is touting Special Counsel John Durham's probe, predicting that the early indictments in his yearslong investigation into the origins of the Trump-Russia probe are ""just the early building blocks,"" saying he anticipates the findings are ""only going to get deeper and deeper,"" and that it ""all leads back to the Democrats.""During an exclusive interview with Fox News, Trump reacted to Durham’s Thursday indictment of Igor Danchenko— who is believed to be the primary sub-source for former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, who compiled the unverified dossier that served as the basis for Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants against Trump campaign aide Carter Page.The dossier was funded by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign through law firm Perkins Coie.DECLASSIFIED TRUMP-RUSSIA PROBE DOCUMENTS: WHAT TO KNOWDurham on Thursday charged Danchenko with making false statements to the FBI. The charges stemmed from statements he made relating to the sources he used in providing information to an investigative firm in the United Kingdom.""It really has come out,"" Trump told Fox News. ""In all fairness, while it has taken a long time, hats off to John Durham."" Video""Hats off, because, it’s coming out, and it is coming out at a level — Durham has come out with things that are absolutely amazing,"" Trump continued. ""We all sort of knew that happened, and now we have facts, and I think they’re only going to get deeper and deeper — and it all leads back to the Democrats, Hillary and the dirty lawyers.""DNI DECLASSIFIES BRENNAN NOTES, CIA MEMO ON HILLARY CLINTON ‘STIRRING UP SCANDAL’ BETWEEN TRUMP, RUSSIATrump said Clinton lawyers are ""always after Trump"" and called it a ""disgrace,"" but he said ""people understand that.""""What they did was so illegal, at a level that you’ve rarely seen before,"" Trump said. ""Now, in all fairness, it looks to me like this is just the early building blocks.""Danchenko’s indictment comes after Durham last month indicted Clinton lawyer Michael Sussmann for making a false statement. The indictment alleges Sussmann told then-FBI General Counsel James Baker in September 2016 that he was not doing work ""for any client"" when he requested and held a meeting in which he presented data and evidence of a purported secret communications channel between then-candidate Trump and Alfa Bank, which has ties to the Kremlin. Sussman was working for the Clinton campaign at the time.OBAMA ADMINISTRATION BRIEFED ON CLAIMS HILLARY CLINTON DRUMMED UP RUSSIA CONTROVERSY TO VILIFY TRUMP, DISTRACT FROM EMAILSBefore being appointed as special counsel in 2020, Durham charged former FBI lawyer Kevin Clinesmith with making a false statement – the first criminal case arising from his probe. Clinesmith was referred for potential prosecution by the Justice Department's inspector general's office, which conducted its own review of the Russia investigation.Specifically, the inspector general accused Clinesmith, though not by name, of altering an email about Page to say that he was ""not a source"" for another government agency. Page has said he was a source for the CIA. The DOJ relied on that assertion as it submitted a third and final renewal application in 2017 to eavesdrop on Page under FISA.  VideoMeanwhile, in a court filing dated Oct. 20, Durham revealed his team’s first production of discovery to the defense — which included thousands of documents received ""in response to grand jury subpoenas issued to fifteen separate individuals, entities and organizations — including, among others, political organizations, a university, university researchers, an investigative firm, and numerous companies.""Durham on Thursday said the special counsel’s investigation ""is ongoing.""""Those are big things that are happening, and what it really shows is what a hoax it was,"" Trump told Fox News. ""What happened here is incredible, going on for years, and we still did more than any administration, just about ever.""LIST OF OFFICIALS WHO SOUGHT TO UNMASK FLYNN RELEASED: BIDEN, COMEY, OBAMA CHIEF OF STAFF AMONG THEMThe former president touted his administration amidst the yearslong investigation into whether his first campaign colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 presidential election led by former Special Counsel Robert Mueller.""We rebuilt our military, we cut taxes — the most ever — and regulations, we’ve done so much,"" Trump said. ""Nobody has done what we’ve done.""Mueller’s investigation yielded no evidence of criminal conspiracy or coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russians during the 2016 election. VideoAt the conclusion of Mueller’s probe in 2019, former Attorney General William Barr appointed Durham, who at the time served as the U.S. attorney from Connecticut, to investigate the origins of the FBI’s original Russia probe, also known as Crossfire Hurricane, which began in July 2016. Durham was instructed to review that probe through the appointment of Mueller in May 2017.NEWLY DECLASSIFIED INTEL DOCUMENT NOTED STEELE DOSSIER CLAIMS HAD 'LIMITED CORROBORATION' The Trump administration moved to declassify dozens of documents, which Trump and allies cast as significant, citing their content as proof that the investigation into Trump and his first campaign was baseless. Barr, before leaving the Trump administration in December 2020, tapped Durham as special counsel to continue his investigation through the Biden administration.In the scope order, Barr stated that Durham ""is authorized to investigate whether any federal official, employee, or any other person or entity violated the law in connection with the intelligence, counter-intelligence, or law-enforcement activities directed at the 2016 presidential campaigns, individuals associated with those campaigns, and individuals associated with the administration of President Donald J. Trump, including but not limited to Crossfire Hurricane and the investigation of Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller, III.""Under U.S. code, the special counsel would produce a ""confidential report"" and is ordered to ""submit to the Attorney General a final report, and such interim reports as he deems appropriate in a form that will permit public dissemination.""

 Donald Trump’s company won’t have to pay hefty legal bills incurred by his former personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen, who became a vocal critic of the ex-president and went to prison after pleading guilty to tax and other crimes, a New York judge ruled Friday. Judge Joel M. Cohen threw out Cohen’s breach of contract lawsuit against the Trump Organization, rejecting his claims that the company had promised to cover his legal bills and finding that fees he racked up as a result of the criminal investigation into his conduct weren’t the company’s responsibility.Michael Cohen said in the lawsuit, filed in March 2019, that the Trump Organization owed him at least $1.9 million for the cost of his defense. The judge noted in his ruling that after the lawsuit was filed, Trump’s company did go ahead and pay some of his bills.      Michael Cohen, right, President Donald Trump's former lawyer, leans back to listen to his lawyer Lanny Davis of Washington, during testimony before the House Oversight and Reform Committee, on Capitol Hill, Wednesday, Feb. 27, 2019, in Washington. (A""In a nutshell, Mr. Cohen’s legal fees arise out of his (sometimes unlawful) service to Mr. Trump personally, to Mr. Trump’s campaign, and to the Trump Foundation, but not out of his service to the business of the Trump Organization, which is the only defendant in this case,"" the judge wrote in his decision. Michael Cohen and the judge are not related.Lanny Davis, a lawyer for Michael Cohen, tweeted that the decision was ""unfair,"" and asked for contributions to a GoFundMe page set up for Cohen’s legal defense in 2018.

It says that was around the time Cohen began discussing privately with friends and family that he was considering cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller and federal prosecutors in New York.Cohen pleaded guilty in August 2018 to tax crimes, lying to Congress and campaign finance violations, some of which involved his role in orchestrating payments to two women to keep them from talking publicly about alleged affairs with Trump.Cohen served about a year in prison before being released to home confinement as part of an attempt to slow the spread of COVID-19 in federal prisons.

EPA details push to tighten rules for lead in drinking water | Fox ...,2021-12-17 10:33:00,"   close      video Fox Business Flash top headlines for December 17 Check out what's clicking on FoxBusiness.com.
 The Biden administration took steps Thursday aimed at reducing lead in drinking water, announcing plans to release $2.9 billion in infrastructure bill funds next year for lead pipe removal and impose stricter rules to limit exposure to the health hazard. Vice President Kamala Harris made the case for the administration’s push to eliminate every lead service line in the country, reiterating the administration’s pledge that the effort would create jobs across the country and begin to undo the harm pollution has caused in poor, often minority communities.""The challenge that we face is, without any question, great. Lead is built into our cities. It is laid under our roads and it is installed in our homes,"" Harris said in remarks at AFL-CIO headquarters in Washington.      U.S. biofuel and corn industry groups said on Monday they are urging the Environmental Protection Agency to use restraint in its use of waivers exempting refiners from their biofuel blending obligations after the Supreme Court last week upheld the coHARRIS ANNOUNCES PRIVATE-SECTOR INVESTMENTS IN CENTRAL AMERICA The White House estimates between 6 million and 10 million U.S. households and 400,000 schools get water through lead service lines, which connect buildings to the water main and can leach particles of the neurotoxin into drinking water and potentially cause severe developmental and neurological issues — especially when consumed by children. In recent years, the risks facing cities with lead service lines have come into focus, most notably after the Flint, Michigan, water crisis.The administration estimates 24 million homes are at risk of having lead paint, which can pose significant health risks even when absorbed at low levels.While the EPA considers how to strengthen the nation’s lead-in-water rules, it will allow the previous Trump administration’s overhaul of lead regulations to move forward, officials said Thursday. The Biden EPA’s requirements are expected to be finalized by 2024, and would require the replacement of remaining lead drinking water pipes ""as quickly as is feasible.""""The science on lead is settled — there is no safe level of exposure and it is time to remove this risk to support thriving people and vibrant communities,"" said EPA administrator Michael Regan in a statement.

(Evelyn Hockstein/Pool Photo via AP)BIDEN SUGGESTS MEGA-SPENDING BILL LIKELY TO MISS END-OF-YEAR DEADLINESome environmental advocates were lukewarm to the administration’s announcement, saying the 10-year goal for replacing lead lines and other provisions were vague on commitments and detail.""The top priority must be to require removal of all lead pipes within the decade and to set a strict at-the-tap standard, which is the only way to prevent another generation of kids from drinking water through what is essentially a lead straw,"" said Erik Olson, senior strategic director of health at the Natural Resources Defense Council. ""Good intentions won’t be enough to get the job done,"" he added.John Rumpler, senior attorney with Environment America, called the administration’s plans ""long-overdue and an indispensable step toward securing safe water."" He also said the EPA should set a 10-year deadline to replace lead service lines, as New Jersey did in July.At a Thursday briefing, deputy White House national climate adviser Ali Zaidi acknowledged the difficulty of locating and mapping out lead lines, which can be hard to assess in older cities and towns.""A little bit of this ... is mapping the topography of the mountain as we’re starting to climb it,"" Zaidi said. ""We have to go out there, we have to collect the data. There are communities around the United States where we do not know where the pipes are.""GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HEREThe White House also has plans to commit $5 billion for the removal of lead-based paint in Democrats’ $2 trillion social and environmental package. That bill remains stalled in the Senate.The Trump-era rule said public water systems should replace 3% of their lead service lines each year if lead levels exceed 15 parts per billion. That rate is lower than the previous 7% standard established in 1991, but Trump administration officials said at the time that the rule eliminated loopholes that allowed water systems to avoid removing pipes and would actually make the replacement process faster.But environmental groups were critical, saying it allowed removal to happen too slowly.The Trump administration also set requirements to ensure water systems prevent lead in pipes from corroding into drinking water. And it revamped lead testing to make sure the samples water systems use in testing come from water sitting in lead pipes instead of near the faucet — a move that experts say could push lead level results higher for many utilities around the country.The Biden EPA said it is considering ways to strengthen key parts of the regulation, including the 15 parts-per-billion threshold.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESSCongress approved $15 billion for lead service line replacement in the infrastructure bill — about a third less than what the White House and water experts say it would cost to replace them nationally.Administration officials spoke about additional efforts being taken to limit lead exposure, including more childhood surveillance testing for lead exposure by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and grants from the Department of Housing and Urban Development to remove lead paint in public housing. The Treasury Department is also announcing that surplus COVID-19 relief funds can be used for lead service line replacement projects.""There is no reason in the 21st century for why people are still exposed to this substance that was poisoning people back in the 18th century,"" Harris said.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",24,199.0,0.08466666666666667,0.871,0.044000000000000004,-0.32126666666666664,0.043,0.9,0.056,0.8659,-7.7104,-6.569685714285711,121.0,-0.0542949232585596
