Inside the Palestinian town that far-right Israeli minister wants 'erased',2023-03-03,"A burning smell lingers in the air of Huwara.  Shattered glass still litters people's property. A ten-year-old child brandishes a spent Israeli military stun grenade, explaining he knows it's safe because the string that activates it is gone.   The gray and black carcasses of burnt out cars serve as a grotesque reminder of the worst Israeli settler violence these Palestinian villagers say they've ever experienced.  The town, just south of Nablus in the occupied West Bank, has long been a flashpoint for Israeli-Palestinian violence. Part of the reason is that it straddles one of the main roadways, route 60, that Israeli settlers and Palestinians alike use. It's also surrounded on three sides by Israeli Jewish settlements that have a reputation for being extremely nationalistic.    It's here that two Israeli brothers were shot and killed at point blank range on Sunday while they sat in traffic. The person or persons responsible have yet to be found.    It's here that, hours later, dozens of settlers went on a rampage that one of Israel's top military generals later called a ""pogrom,"" leading to the death of one Palestinian man and other injuries.  Huwara resident Nahawand Damidi's house is behind a metal fence, for protection against settler attacks. But Sunday night the violence reached another level, she told CNN on Thursday.  ""[The settlers] usually attack us by throwing stones. If we try to defend ourselves they will use weapons, but last time was different. Wherever you looked there were bullets ... fires, fires everywhere,"" she said, standing on her balcony.  Security camera footage residents shared with CNN show settlers -- identified by their religious tassels, called tzitzit, hanging from under their sweatshirts -- piling flammable material in front of 75-year-old Nawal Dumeidi's door, before setting it aflame.   The double door is marred with black scar marks from the flames that literally melted the lock, Dumeidi said. Her two sons had to come back from Dubai to force open the door and free her, she told CNN.  ""What happened is a wild terrorism,"" she said, adding she was stuck in her home for three days before she was able to leave.  Villagers told CNN that they would normally expect the Israeli military to protect them from settler attacks but that on Sunday they did not. The top Israeli general in the West Bank, Major General Yehuda Fuchs, admitted earlier this week the IDF was unprepared for the scale of the settler violence against Palestinians and took responsibility for not controlling it.  ""We will wipe out Huwara""  Many Israelis go to Huwara to get their cars repaired -- with prices being much cheaper than on the other side of the Green Line. The Abu Saris family owns one of those repair shops -- but dozen of cars on their lot are now burnt.   Daughter Lamar, 10, speaks confidently and openly about what happened -- she's given several media interviews already.  But she also no longer wants to sleep in her room. Her window was broken when settlers threw stones at it.  ""Mom hid us in our room and went to the rooftop to see what's happening.  We heard them breaking the windows of the house. We didn't do anything to them,"" she says, her seven-year-old brother Joud and two-year-old sister Siwar sitting beside her.  Siwar, wearing a yellow Pokemon onesie, whispers ""Beep, fire"" after she hears a noise outside.  ""The biggest crime they did to us is not the business and the cars, but our terrified and traumatized children,"" their mother Hana says. ""Look at [Siwar], she's terrified only from hearing a random sound downstairs.""  Hana says as the settlers burned the cars in their lot and shot three bullets toward the home, they screamed ""death to Arabs, we will wipe out Huwara.""  Three days after settlers tried to do exactly that, far-right Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, himself a settler leader, repeated the phrase on stage at a media conference.   ""I think the village of Huwara needs to be erased,"" he told a reporter at a conference run by the Israeli business magazine The Marker. ""I think the State of Israel needs to do this, and not -- God forbid -- private citizens.""  The incendiary remarks drew a harsh and swift rebuke from the US State Department, which dubbed them ""repugnant"" and ""disgusting."" Even Israel's Ambassador to the US Michael Herzog called it ""against our values.""   And though Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he doesn't accept such violence and called on Israelis not to take the law ""into their own hands"" in the wake of the rampage, he has yet to denounce Smotrich's comments.  Israeli support  Many Israelis are disgusted by the violence in Huwara, seeing it as a natural ramification of the most right-wing and pro-settler government in Israeli history.    On Friday, Israeli soldiers intervened in Huwara to prevent dozens of Israelis from demonstrating in support of the villagers.   The town has been deemed a closed military zone in the wake of the violence, specifically with the aim of keeping the sides apart and de-escalating the situation.  Meanwhile, a campaign started by left-wing activist Yair ""Yaya"" Fink to raise funds for the residents has collected more than 1.7 million shekels (nearly $500,000).    ""As a religious person, a Zionist, a major [in the military] and as a person, I cannot be silent while my peers are burning villages,"" Fink tweeted the day after the rampage.  Fink says he's received death threats and spam calls and texts because of his campaign. But he tweeted he'll keep going: ""Whoever thinks that this or the threats on my life will break me doesn't know me, just another motivation to fight against the terrorist anarchists.""   And Huwara has even become a rallying cry during the protests against the Israeli government's sweeping judicial reforms. On Wednesday as border police clashed with protesters in Tel Aviv, many chanted ""Where were you in Huwara?""

US condemns Israel far right minister's call for Palestinian town 'to be erased',2023-03-01,"Israel's far-right finance minister's call for a Palestinian town ""to be erased"" was harshly condemned by US State Department spokesperson Ned Price on Wednesday, who described the comments as ""repugnant"" and ""irresponsible."" Bezalel Smotrich, who also leads the far-right Religious Zionism party, said earlier on Wednesday that the Palestinian town of Huwara ""needs to be erased."" The incendiary comment was in reference to the town in the occupied West Bank where two Israeli brothers were shot and killed on Sunday, prompting a rampage through the area by Israeli Jewish settlers that left at least one Palestinian man dead, others injured, and homes and cars burned. Smotrich was asked Wednesday why he had liked a post on Twitter after the brothers were shot, but before the settler rampage, saying that Huwara should be erased. ""I think the village of Huwara needs to be erased,"" he told a reporter at a conference run the Israeli business magazine The Marker. ""I think the State of Israel needs to do this, and not -- God forbid -- private citizens."" Price issued a strong condemnation from the US State Department podium Wednesday, saying, ""I want to be very clear about this. These comments were irresponsible. They were repugnant. They were disgusting."" ""And just as we condemn Palestinian incitement to violence, we condemn these provocative remarks that also amount to incitement to violence,"" he said at a State Department briefing. Price also called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ""and other senior Israeli officials to publicly and clearly reject and disavow these comments."" ""We condemn, as we have consistently, terrorism and extremism in all of its forms, and we continue to urge that there be equal measures of accountability for extremist actions, regardless of the backgrounds of the perpetrators or the victims,"" he said. Asked by CNN if he would condemn Smotrich's comments following Price's call for ""senior Israeli officials to publicly and clearly reject and disavow these comments,"" Israeli Ambassador to the US Michael Herzog said, ""Notwithstanding the fact that Israel has been subjected to a recent wave of horrific terror attacks against its civilians, it is absolutely not Israeli policy and it's against our values to respond by wiping out civilian villages."" Smotrich is expected to visit Washington and New York City in March, but has no meetings planned with Biden administration officials, a source told CNN. 'Pogrom' The top Israeli general in the West Bank, Yehuda Fuchs, Tuesday night referred to the Israeli settlers' actions as a ""pogrom."" Maj. Gen. Fuchs said Tuesday night that the Israel Defense Forces had not been sufficiently prepared for the revenge attacks that followed the killing of the Yaniv brothers in the town on Sunday. ""We did not prepare for a pogrom on the scale of dozens of people who come with incendiary devices... they go and set fire to random Palestinian houses, vehicles, etc. -- simply  indiscriminate terror,"" Fuchs said, in unusually blunt remarks by an Israeli military official criticizing Israeli settlers. ""This event in Huwara is a pogrom that was done by outlaws,"" he said, using a word originally meaning organized riots against Jews in imperial Russia. Palestinians have accused the IDF of attacking Palestinians or standing aside and allowing settlers to run riot. But Fuchs said the Israel Defense Forces had intervened in Huwara to defend Palestinians from settlers, who clashed not only with Palestinians but with Israeli troops and police. ""Soldiers of the Golani Reconnaissance Unit opened fire on Israelis, outlaws that almost killed Palestinians,"" he said. The IDF has sent four additional battalions to the area since Sunday in an effort to ""de-escalate"" the situation and keep Israeli settlers and Palestinians apart, they announced. Six additional people were arrested on Tuesday night in connection with the Huwara riots, Israel Police said Wednesday -- four adults and two minors. ""These suspects were arrested on suspicion of their involvement in violent disturbances, arson, assault, and causing damage in Huwara,"" a police statement said, specifying that they are suspected of ""setting fire to vehicles and buildings, attacking Palestinians and causing damage."" ""The investigation is ongoing and more arrests are expected,"" the statement said. Eight people were arrested on suspicion of involvement in the riots earlier in the week, of whom at least two are now under house arrest, Israel Police said earlier.","{'neg': 0.216, 'neu': 0.784, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.5106}",28,1.0,0.106,0.787,0.106,0.0,0.218,0.745,0.038,-0.9995,0.0,,,
US citizen killed in West Bank as Israeli-Palestinian tensions rise,2023-02-28,"An Israeli-American citizen was killed in the occupied West Bank as tensions in the region continued to ratchet up after a weekend of violence. Elan Ganeles, 27, was shot dead on Monday evening in what Israel's Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency service described as a ""terror attack"" on a highway between Jericho and the Dead Sea. The attack took place on Route 90, north of the Beit Ha'Arava Junction, the MDA said. The location is normally peaceful and on one of the main routes for Israelis to visit the Dead Sea. Ganeles was visiting Israel for a friend's wedding and lived in the United States, friends of his told CNN on Tuesday. His synagogue in Connecticut said he would be buried in Israel on Wednesday.  Steve Charter, the manager of a Hebrew language program Ganeles attended, told CNN on Tuesday that Ganeles was ""a really nice guy, a gentleman ... the type of guy you want your daughter to date."" Charter said Ganeles attended the five-month course at Kibbutz Sde Eliyahu in 2015 before joining the Israeli army. After he completed his army service, he returned to the United States to study at Columbia University, Charter said. ""He wanted to celebrate his friend's wedding, see his friends and go back to America,"" added Michael Landau, a friend of Ganeles from the Hebrew program. ""He was on his way to see a friend when he got murdered.""  Landau said Ganeles was aware of the security situation in Israel and the West Bank but did not appear to be worried about it. ""He lived here in the past so he understands the situation,"" Landau said. ""He never expressed any concern about the fact that something was going on."" The US State Department confirmed an Israeli-American citizen had been killed, and said it was ""extremely concerned by the events of this weekend and the continuing violence in Israel and the West Bank."" Ganeles's death came after a mob of Israeli settlers went on a rampage Sunday in Huwara, south of Nablus in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, killing one Palestinian, beating others with metal bars, and stoning a Palestinian fire engine after burning several homes. Those attacks followed the fatal shooting of two Israeli brothers earlier on Sunday in Huwara, days after a massive Israeli military raid into Nablus in search of wanted militants left at least 11 Palestinians dead. State Department spokesman Ned Price on Monday reiterated the US' condemnation of the killings of Israelis over the weekend and the violence by settlers against Palestinians. ""We appreciate Prime Minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu and President [Isaac] Herzog's statements calling for a cessation of vigilante violence. We expect the Israeli government to ensure full accountability and legal prosecution of those responsible for these attacks, in addition to compensation for the lost homes and property,"" Price said. ""These events underscore the fragility of the situation in the West Bank and the urgent need for increased cooperation to prevent further violence."" An Israel Defense Forces official condemned Sunday's attacks by Israeli settlers as acts of ""revenge"" and ""terror,"" and said the IDF was sending three additional battalions to the area to try to deescalate the situation.

Israeli military calls settler attacks on Palestinians 'actions of terror' after weekend of violence,2023-02-27,"The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) sees the previous day's attacks by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank as ""actions of terror,"" an IDF official said Monday, as tensions in the region simmered after a weekend of violence.  At least one Palestinian man was killed, a Palestinian fire engine was stoned by a crowd of about 50 settlers, and other Palestinians were injured with stones or metal bars, Palestinian medical officials said Sunday, blaming Israeli settlers in the West Bank. Violence continued into Monday, when a 27-year-old man, who has not yet been named publicly, was pronounced dead, according to a statement by Hadassah Mt. Scopus hospital. He was shot in the West Bank on a highway between Jericho and the Dead Sea on Monday, according to Israel's Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency service. The West Bank victim ""was unconscious outside his car with gunshot wounds to his upper body,"" when MDA paramedic Eden Cohen arrived to treat him, Cohen said in a statement released by the service. The attacks followed the fatal shooting of two Israeli brothers earlier on Sunday in the town of Huwara, south of Nablus in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, just days after a massive Israeli military raid into Nablus in search of wanted militants left at least 11 Palestinians dead. ""Last night there was revenge activity done by people that live in the area. I wanted to say we see these actions as actions of a terror, these violent riots,"" the IDF official said, asking not to be named due to the sensitivity of the situation. ""It's been a horrible night,"" the official added. The official said the reason the IDF was sending three additional battalions to the area was to keep the Palestinians and Israelis apart. ""More forces will de-escalate"" the situation, the official said. ""This morning we've sent in another Givati (reconnaissance) battalion -- the Givati Special Forces battalion -- into the area in addition to two Border Patrol companies, basically trying to de-escalate and keep the two sides apart."" Israel's Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant vowed to arrest the individual or individuals who killed the settlers and called for calm while allowing military and security forces to work and apprehend the perpetrators.  ""It is neither legitimate nor possible to operate individually,"" Gallant said Monday, while visiting the location where the incident took place. ""We cannot allow a situation in which citizens take the law into their hands. I call on everyone to follow law and order and to trust the IDF and security forces everywhere, across the country."" The IDF detained eight people in connection with the attacks in Huwara, some of whom have since been released, Israel Police spokesman Dean Elsdunne told CNN Monday. Cycle of violence Sameh Hamdallah Mahmoud Aqtash, 37, was shot in the abdomen and killed in the town of Za'tara, between Huwara and the Israeli settlement of Kfar Tapuach, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said Sunday night. In Huwara itself, at least one person was stabbed and another assaulted with an iron bar, the Palestinian Red Crescent said.  The Israeli settlers who were killed earlier were named as brothers Hillel Menachem Yaniv, 21, and Yagel Yaakov Yaniv, 19, according to the local settler council. Video from the scene showed that their car had crossed a median, and hit a vehicle going the other direction, suggesting they were shot while driving.  Late Sunday, the IDF announced that the older brother, Hillel, was a serving soldier and expressed condolences in a statement. Peace talks Following rare talks on Sunday brokered by Jordan, Egypt and the United States, Israeli and Palestinian representatives ""affirmed their commitment to all previous agreements between them, and to work towards a just and lasting peace."" Israel and the Palestinian Authority confirmed their ""joint readiness and commitment to immediately work to end unilateral measures for a period of 3-6 months. This includes an Israeli commitment to stop discussion of any new settlement units for 4 months and to stop authorization of any outposts for 6 months,"" a joint statement read. However, in response to the announcement of a halt on settlement construction, far-right Religious Zionism party leader Bezalel Smotrich firmly rejected a pause, ""even for one day."" In a post on Twitter, the Israeli finance minister appeared out of alignment with his government, writing: ""There will not be a freeze on settlement building and development, not even for one day (this is under my authority). The IDF will continue to act to counter terrorism in all areas of Judea and Samaria without any limitations (we will reaffirm this in the cabinet). It's very simple."" Israeli cabinet approves bill allowing death penalty for 'terrorists' Also on Sunday, Israel's cabinet approved a proposed law to impose the death penalty on ""terrorists."" It is officially a private member's bill sponsored by the far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, rather than government-backed legislation.  The law would give courts the power to ""impose the death penalty on those who have committed the crime of murder on nationalistic grounds against the citizens of Israel,"" a statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Ben Gvir said. After a preliminary vote in the Knesset, or parliament, Israel's political-security cabinet will next discuss the language in the bill, before it goes to the committee stage. If it passes the committee stage, it will require three Knesset readings to become law. There have been previous attempts to introduce the death penalty in 2016 and 2018, according to the Israel Democracy Institute, but they did not become law. In response to the moves, the Palestinian government on Monday condemned ""in the strongest terms"" the Israeli cabinet's approval, according to a statement from the Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  ""The death penalty violates the fundamental rights of the Palestinian people to life, non-discrimination, and self-determination. It is a cruel, barbaric, and inhumane bill rooted in Jewish supremacy and precisely aimed to deny the Palestinian people their right to exist and their humanity,"" it said, while also calling on the international community to take ""concrete actions to pressure Israel to rescind its bill.""

Netanyahu's crises mount as Israeli-Palestinian tensions ratchet up,2023-02-27,"Benjamin Netanyahu has not even been back in power two months, and already he faces unprecedented, multi-faceted challenges on nearly every front.   From Israeli-Palestinian violence, to protests over his government's judicial overhaul, to new challenges on the international stage, Israel's longest-serving prime minister has his work cut out for him.  Israeli, Palestinian violence at a 20-year high  Netanyahu took office at the end of what was one of the deadliest years for both Israelis and for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank in years. And the cycle has only picked up speed.  At least 60 Palestinians, both militants and civilian, have been killed so far this year according to Palestinian authorities, while at least 14 Israelis (all civilians except for one), have been killed in the same time period -- the latest a 27-year-old man shot and killed on a normally calm West Bank road near the Dead Sea.  Two particularly deadly daytime Israeli military raids in the West Bank targeting militants have triggered a series of Palestinian attacks targeting Israelis.   On Sunday two Israeli brothers who live in West Bank settlements were shot ""point blank"" while sitting in traffic on a road that goes through the Palestinian town of Huwara, in what Israeli officials called ""an extremely serious terrorist attack.""    A few hours later, as night fell, Israeli settlers went on a rampage, burning houses, cars, and violently attacking some Palestinians, including shooting and killing a 37-year-old man, in what both Palestinian and Israeli officials say were ""revenge attacks"" -- and which officials on both sides called terrorism.   The Israel Defense Forces sent reinforcements into the West Bank with the Palestinian attacker still at large, while at least eight Israelis were detained in connection to the settlers' revenge attacks.  All of this happened on the same day Israeli, Palestinian, Jordanian, Egyptian and American security officials met in Jordan in an effort to reduce exactly these sort of situations, and bring some sense of calm ahead of the Ramadan and Passover holidays ahead.  But despite a joint communiqué about what steps will be taken, including an Israeli commitment to halt discussion around settlements for several months, some of Netanyahu's own ministers almost immediately dismissed the summit.  ""What happens in Jordan (if it happens) will stay in Jordan,"" National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir tweeted.  Thousands in the streets  Despite the worsening security situation, most Israelis are focused on the effects of the Netanyahu government's proposed judicial overhaul, which have led to eight weeks in a row of regular, massive protests across the country.   The most sweeping of these changes would give the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, power to overturn Supreme Court decisions and would fundamentally change how judges are chosen. While Netanyahu and his allies say these changes are sorely needed to help rebalance an elitist court that has sucked in too much authority, critics say it will end the independence of the judiciary. Others say it's simply a ploy to help Netanyahu out of his ongoing corruption trial -- something he vehemently denies.   But despite the regular protests attended by tens of thousands of Israelis -- some 160,000 took to the streets this weekend -- and pleas from President Isaac Herzog to meet with opposition lawmakers to come to a consensus on the planned overhaul, the legislation has been pushed through its initial stage.   The plan has already led to economic fallout. Several financial institutions, including JP Morgan, have warned of a growing risk of investing in Israel as a result of the judicial changes overhaul. Executives in Israel's lucrative high tech sector have either already announced or are warning they're pulling investments as a result.  ""We have been called the startup nation. And we basically say, come on, don't risk it. Foreign investors have voted with their feet in favor of Israel. And they vote with their feet when they are unhappy with the developments. And they express concern, deep concerns,"" Jacob Frenkel, former governor of the Bank of Israel, the central bank, told CNN's Richard Quest last month.   Wiz, a cyber security startup, announced it had raised $300 million on Monday valuing the company at $10 billion -- but won't put any of that money in Israel.  ""Unfortunately, due to the legal coup the money raised will not enter Israel,"" Wiz CEO Assaf Rappaport said in a statement reported by Reuters. ""Our big concern about Israeli high tech is not only about money leaving Israel but also the large amount of money that will no longer enter Israel.""     Government partners 'have him over a barrel'   Most of the controversies surrounding Netanyahu are exacerbated by his governing partners -- the most right-wing government in Israeli history, says Netanyahu biographer Anshel Pfeffer.   ""I think this is the least Netanyahu has ever been in control as a prime minister. He's basically not running his government, his government is being run by the coalition partners who have him over a barrel,"" said Pfeffer, who is also a correspondent for The Economist and Haaretz. ""He has no option... he has no alternative coalition.""  Netanyahu's ministers have occasionally undercut their own government's actions.   After the summit in Aqaba, Finance Minister and settler leader Bezalel Smotrich tweeted: ""I have no idea what they talked about or didn't talk about in Jordan. I heard about this unnecessary conference from the media just like you. But one thing I do know: there will not be a freeze on settlement building and development, not even for one day (this is under my authority). The IDF will continue to act to counter terrorism in all areas of Judea and Samaria [West Bank] without any limitations (we will reaffirm this in the cabinet). It's very simple.""  It's also Netanyahu's coalition partners who are refusing to bend on the judicial overhaul plans, Pfeffer believes.  His coalition is saying ""No way, we're not going to let up -- we have this opportunity once in a state's lifetime. And we want to drastically reduce the power of the Supreme Court,"" Pfeffer said. ""Netanyahu is not running the show on this.""     International pressure  Meanwhile, Netanyahu and his government face increasing international pressure from allies, notably the United States, which has criticized settlement expansion and some of Israel's actions in the occupied West Bank. Even President Joe Biden has gotten personally involved by calling for consensus on the judicial reforms, a rare presidential incursion into domestic Israeli politics.   ""We've never had this kind of differences between Jerusalem and Washington, it's always been over the Palestinian issue. It's been over the Iran issue. It's never been about the way the Israeli government is legislating on a democratic agenda. And this is the first time that we've ever seen a president almost openly rebuke an Israeli prime minister over such matters,"" Pfeffer said.  Netanyahu wouldn't choose these battles, Pfeffer said, arguing that he doesn't want to be in the position of ""having the entire Israeli business community, the security establishment, the media, and increasingly, the international community"" questioning his government.  But, Pfeffer says, he has no other choice if he wants to stay in power.

"Two Israeli settlers killed in West Bank shooting, days after Israeli raid kills 11 Palestinians",2023-02-26,"Two Israeli settlers were shot and killed in the West Bank on Sunday, local settler leader Yossi Dagan said, calling it ""an extremely serious terrorist attack."" The shooting sparked revenge attacks by Israeli settlers against Palestinians, causing at least one death and numerous injuries. The shooting of the settlers took place in Huwara, south of Nablus in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, just days after a massive Israeli military raid into Nablus in search of wanted militants left at least 11 Palestinians dead. The settlers killed on Sunday were named as brothers Hillel Menachem Yaniv, 21, and Yagel Yaakov Yaniv, 19, the local settler council said. ""We embrace the family and will be with them as much as necessary,"" the Shomron (Samaria) Regional Council said. They were from the settlement of Har Bracha, council leader Yossi Dagan said. Video from the scene showed that their car had crossed a median, and hit a vehicle going the other direction, suggesting they were shot while driving.  The two Israeli men were taken to a hospital after the attack, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said, but they later died, the Magen David Adom medical agency said. The IDF added that it was pursuing the attacker. Another local settler leader said he was present when the two were shot. ""The shooting took place right behind me. It looked terrible -- the shooting was from point blank range,"" said Shai Alon, the head of Beit El council, adding that Israel needed to ""go to war against those who wish us harm."" Netanyahu urges against 'revenge attacks' Hours after the incident, Israelis killed at least one Palestinian man and injured several others with stones or iron bars in and around Huwara, Palestinian medics and the Ministry of Health said Sunday night. Sameh Hamdallah Mahmoud Aqtash, 37, was shot in the abdomen and killed in the town of Za'tara, between Huwara and the Israeli settlement of Kfar Tapuach, the ministry said. In Huwara itself, at least one person was stabbed and another assaulted with an iron bar, the Palestinian Red Crescent said. The emergency service also reported its ambulances were attacked, and said Israeli military forces had prevented three ambulances from entering the town. The Palestinian Ministry of Health said a person had been treated for a minor injury from a metal rod in the face, and another had been treated for a skull fracture from being hit in the head with a stone. Two Palestinian firefighters said that about 50 settlers had stoned their fire engine, injuring them as they attempted to respond to a fire at a Palestinian house in Huwara, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported. The Red Crescent also said it had dealt with nearly 100 cases of smoke inhalation. Social media video which CNN geolocated to Huwara appeared to show several dozen Israeli settlers walking down a main street as at least three fires burned by the side of the road. Other photographs and videos circulating on social media appeared to show fires burning in the town. The Palestinian Authority Presidency accused the settlers of carrying out ""terrorist acts... under the protection of the Israeli occupation forces, in Hawara, Burin, Einabus and other areas, which resulted in the injury of more than 100 Palestinians and the burning of shops, homes, cars and other public property."" Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid accused Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, the leader of the settler-based Religious Zionism party, of being responsible for the violence. Linking the events to deconfliction talks between Israel and the Palestinians in Jordan earlier in the day, Lapid tweeted: ""Smotrich's militias set out to burn Hawara in order to torpedo the summit in Aqaba of Netanyahu and [Defense Minister Yoav] Gallant. This government is dangerous to Israel's security."" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement asking Israelis not to engage in revenge attacks for the killing of Hillel and Yagel Yaniv earlier in the day. ""I ask -- even when the blood is boiling --  not to take the law into one's hands. I ask that the IDF and the security forces be allowed to carry out their work. I remind you that in recent weeks, they have targeted dozens of terrorists and thwarted dozens of attacks,"" Netanyahu said. The IDF are sending reinforcements to the West Bank to ""thwart terror attacks and prevent violent riots,"" it said Sunday night. The ""riots"" -- an apparent reference to the settlers carrying out revenge attacks against Palestinians -- ""are being handled by the IDF, Israeli Fire and Rescue Services, Israeli Border Police and additional security forces,"" the IDF said. On Sunday night, IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi visited the site where the Yaniv brothers were shot, the IDF said, and ""ordered the area to be reinforced with additional forces to thwart terror attacks and prevent violent riots, while increasing and expanding the efforts to capture the terrorists."" Tensions rising in wake of Nablus raid No group has so far claimed responsibility for the attack on the Israeli brothers, but Lion's Den had vowed revenge after Wednesday's raid in Nablus.  Six of those who died there were members of the Palestinian militant group, which emerged in the city last year. ""As big as the pain filling Nablus, the occupation will taste twice the pain,"" the group said, referring to Israel. ""They will know that the fighters of the honorable groups in Nablus will not take a step back."" Dagan, the head of the Samaria Regional Council, called after Sunday's killings for Israel to break off ongoing security talks between Israel and the Palestinians brokered by Jordan, Egypt and the United States, saying: ""I demand that the Prime Minister, the Minister of Defense and all the ministers return the delegation from the idle talks in Aqaba.... We need to launch an operation against terrorism!"" Following the rare talks on Sunday, Israeli and Palestinian representatives ""affirmed their commitment to all previous agreements between them, and to work towards a just and lasting peace,"" they said in a joint statement. Jordanian, Egyptian, and US senior officials attended the summit in Aqaba following an invitation of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. The joint statement said both sides reaffirmed the necessity of committing to de-escalation on the ground and to prevent further violence. Israel and the Palestinian Authority confirmed their ""joint readiness and commitment to immediately work to end unilateral measures for a period of 3-6 months. This includes an Israeli commitment to stop discussion of any new settlement units for 4 months and to stop authorization of any outposts for 6 months,"" the statement read. The five parties agreed to convene again in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, in March. ""Jordan, Egypt and the United States consider these understandings as major progress towards re-establishing and deepening relations between the two sides, and commit to assisting and facilitating as appropriate their implementation,"" the statement said.","{'neg': 0.381, 'neu': 0.619, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.8402}",44,5.0,0.21975,0.7645,0.01575,-0.5187999999999999,0.171,0.769,0.06,-0.9995,-22.827199999999998,-72.10832222222223,183.0,-0.3940345476624165
"About 160,000 people protest against Netanyahu's judicial overhaul in Tel Aviv",2023-02-26,"About 160,000 people demonstrated in Tel Aviv Saturday night against the Israeli government's plans to weaken the country's judicial system, crowd expert Ofer Grinboim Liron told CNN. That would make it one of the biggest single demonstrations yet against the legislation. Grinboim Liron, the CEO of Crowd Solutions, which specializes in crowd dynamics at events and venues, based his estimate on drone photos at 8 p.m. local time (1 p.m. ET). Organizers of the protests said an additional 130,000 people protested in other demonstrations across the country Saturday night. Numbers from organizers have been higher than estimates from independent experts such as Grinboim Liron. Tel Aviv and other cities around Israel have been seeing regular Saturday night demonstrations against the judicial overhaul plans for eight weeks. The package of legislation would give Israel's parliament, the Knesset, the power to overrule Supreme Court decisions with a simple majority. It would also give the government the power to nominate judges, which currently rests with a committee composed of judges, legal experts and politicians. It would remove power and independence from government ministries' legal advisers, and take away the power of the courts to invalidate ""unreasonable"" government appointments,  as the High Court did in January, forcing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to fire Interior and Health Minister Aryeh Deri. Four legislative clauses that are part of the overhaul took steps forward this week. The bills allowing Knesset override of Supreme Court decisions and removing the court's power to rule government appointments unreasonable both passed early stages of the process on Wednesday and now go to the committee stage. Two other clauses passed first readings on Monday and require two more readings to become law. Critics accuse Netanyahu of pushing the legislation in order to get out of corruption trials he is currently facing. Netanyahu denies that, saying the trials are collapsing on their own, and that the changes are necessary after judicial overreach by unelected judges. About two out of three (66%) Israelis believe the Supreme Court should have the power to strike down laws incompatible with Israel's Basic Laws, and about the same proportion (63%) say they support the current system of nominating judges, a poll for the Israel Democracy Institute found last week. People who say they voted for opposition parties were far more likely than voters for the parties in the coalition to oppose the changes. Nearly nine out of 10 (87%) people who voted for the opposition said the Supreme Court should have the power to strike down laws incompatible with Basic Laws, while only 44% of coalition voters said it should. The percentage was slightly higher among people who voted for Netanyahu's Likud party, with nearly half (47%) saying the Supreme Court should have that power. Israel does not have a written constitution, but a set of what are called Basic Laws. The survey, which was released February 21, found that about half (53%) of Israelis believed that removing the political independence of the judiciary would harm Israel's economy -- as Israeli economists and businesspeople have been warning. About a third (35%) do not believe the changes would harm the economy. The online and telephone survey of 756 adults in Israel was carried out between February 9 to 13, 2023, and has a margin of error of 3.56 points.","{'neg': 0.167, 'neu': 0.833, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.25}",22,6.0,0.1085,0.8295000000000001,0.062,-0.13862500000000003,0.055,0.902,0.043,-0.8462,-3.0497500000000004,-75.15807222222223,177.0,-0.4246218769617075
11 Palestinians killed during Israeli raid targeting militants in West Bank,2023-02-22,"At least 11 Palestinians were killed Wednesday during a rare daytime raid by Israeli military forces in the occupied West Bank that also left more than 100 injured, Palestinian officials said in the aftermath of an operation described by the local director of Red Crescent as a ""massacre."" Israeli authorities said Wednesday's operation in Nablus targeted three suspects ""planning attacks in the immediate future."" The three were ""neutralized,"" the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Israel Security Agency said in a joint statement.  All three of the suspected Palestinian militants targeted by the IDF were killed, a list of the dead released by the Palestinian Ministry of Health shows. The IDF said one was shot while fleeing and the other two were killed in an exchange of fire with the military.   Israeli authorities said that suspects threw rocks, Molotov cocktails and ""explosive devices"" at Israeli forces.  At least 102 people are injured, according to the official Palestinian News & Information Agency (WAFA) citing the Palestinian health ministry. Seven of the injured are in critical condition, WAFA reported. The Israeli military's daytime raid began at around 10:15 a.m. (3:15 a.m. ET), Ahmad Jibril, the local director of Red Crescent, told CNN. It is ""a time when everyone is out shopping in the open market of the old city. No one expects an invasion at this time of the day,"" he said.  There were Israeli snipers on the rooftops shooting live ammunition, he said. ""That's why many people were shot in the head, shoulders and backs,"" he said. Most of the dead were shot in the head, he added.  ""People who were unarmed and even away from the old city were also shot. Bullets were everywhere!"" he said.  Jibril said there was a drone dropping tear gas ""randomly.""  He also said drones were firing live ammunition, which the IDF denied. Maj. Nir Dinar, an IDF spokesman, told CNN that Israel did not operate drones that fired live ammunition in the West Bank.  ""I think what they saw was small drones that drop tear gas grenades as a riot dispersal means, and these were used,"" he said.  Red Crescent's Jibril said some Israeli special forces were disguised as locals, and while Dinar refused to comment on whether there were undercover Israeli operatives, he said: ""The IDF has such capabilities."" Jibril said their ""teams were prevented from reaching the injured,"" including a four-year-old child with a heart condition who was rendered unconscious by tear gas.  The IDF's Dinar said that he hoped it was not true that Israeli troops had prevented medics from reaching the wounded: ""I am not familiar with such behavior and I hope it did not happen. If they have evidence, let us know and we will take it to the commanders."" Briefing journalists about the raid, the main IDF international spokesman, Lt. Col. Richard Hecht painted a picture of a large, chaotic event, which he said got ""very messy.""  Israeli Security Agency and Border Police Special Forces had approached the house where they believed the suspects were located and told them to surrender, he said.  ""They didn't surrender, they confined themselves into the house and opened extensive fire on our forces,"" he said. One of the suspects tried to leave the house and was shot, he said, while the other two continued exchanging fire with the Israelis.  ""And at some point, we upgraded our efforts. And there were also rockets that were fired on the house. And the two guys were neutralized,"" he said, later confirming that meant killed.  Pressed for details about the rockets, he said: ""When you come into a situation when people are not surrendering, you intensify the fire."" But the battle continued on other fronts, he said, with Israeli reconnaissance units coming under fire. ""It was cars, it was firing from the roofs and it was motorbikes -- a  very, very aggressive exchange of fire,"" he said. ""A lot of violence."" He said the importance of the targets explained the IDF decision to go into the militant hotspot in broad daylight. While they prefer ""night time activity,"" he said the daylight raid ""was based on a specific intelligence indication we got from the Shin Bet,"" as the Israeli Security Agency is generally known.  ""That's why we went in there. These are guys that killed one of our soldiers."" 'Patience is running out'   The Islamic Jihad militant group said two of its commanders were killed in the clashes with Israeli troops.   The Lion's Den militant group also confirmed its members were involved in the fighting, but did not say if any of their members were killed.  One of the dead targeted in the Nablus raid was a Hamas member, the Palestinian militant group said. Hamas claimed Hussam Salim as a member and a martyr, releasing a photograph of him holding an assault rifle with a telescopic sight.   The IDF named him as one of their targets, accusing him of carrying out ""shooting and explosive device attacks"" and dispatching the killers of IDF soldier Ido Baruch last year. The IDF identified Salim as a senior operative of Lion's Den, which claimed responsibility for the killing of Baruch in October of last year. There is overlap between the membership of Palestinian militant groups.  Six of the dead were men in their 20s, the Palestinian health ministry said. One was 16, one was 33, one was 61 and was was 72. All were men, the ministry list of dead shows. The raid brings the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli forces to 61 this year, the Palestinian health ministry said. That number includes people shot as they attacked Israelis, militants being targeted in raids, people clashing with Israeli forces during raids, and bystanders, CNN records show Eleven Israelis have been killed in Palestinian attacks this year: seven in a shooting near a synagogue, three in a car ramming attack, and a border police officer who was stabbed by a teenager and then shot by friendly fire from a civilian security guard. IDF raids into the West Bank usually occur overnight; the last time the military conducted a daylight operation, they said it was because of an immediate threat. Islamic Jihad's armed faction in Gaza, the Al Qassam Brigade, warned they are ""watching the enemy's escalating crimes against our people in the occupied West Bank, and its patience is running out."" 'Violent and deadly' The occupied West Bank has been rocked by a series of lethal Israeli military raids in the past year, as tensions in Israel and the Palestinian territories remain sky-high in a region riven by bloodshed. An Israeli raid in the city of Jenin in January caused the deadliest day for Palestinians in the West Bank in over a year, according to CNN records, with at least 10 Palestinians killed on the day and one dying later of his wounds. One day later, at least seven civilians died in a shooting near a synagogue in Jerusalem -- which Israel deemed one of its worst terror attacks in recent years. This comes as Netanyahu leads a cabinet that has been described as the most far right and religious in the country's history.  Netanyahu previously told CNN's Jake Tapper that people can get ""hung up"" on peace negotiations with the Palestinians, saying he has opted for a different approach.  As relations between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants boil over, CNN's Hadas Gold said the scenes on Wednesday reflected those ""not seen since the second intifada,"" or uprising.","{'neg': 0.31, 'neu': 0.69, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.6705}",59,7.0,0.0,0.9365,0.0635,0.5423,0.152,0.818,0.031,-0.9995,31.9957,-35.68237222222223,214.0,-0.16674005711318798
Your flight from Israel might be about to get quicker. Here's why,2023-02-23,"For years, journey times flying east from Israel depended on who you were flying with. If you were boarding a flight operated by Israeli airlines, including national carrier El Al, your flight would take around two hours more than if you were flying with another airline. The reason? Israeli airlines were banned from the airspace of both Oman and Saudi Arabia. That meant flights to India and Southeast Asia, which would naturally head east from Israel, had to dip south, crossing over Jordan and following the Red Sea down to the bottom of the Arabian Peninsula, before hooking northeast.  Now, all that is set to change. Following the Saudi government's announcement in July 2022 that the country's airspace would open up to all carriers, Oman has followed suit. On February 23, the Civil Aviation Authority of Oman announced that it will open its airspace to ""all carriers that meet the requirements of the Authority for overflying"" -- effectively ending the ban on El Al, Israir and Arkia, Israel's three airlines.  In a tweet, it said the move was ""part of the Sultanate of Oman's continuous efforts to fulfil its obligations under the Chicago Convention of 1944, which stipulates non-discrimination between civil aircrafts used in international air navigation."" The move could cut Israeli carriers' flight times to Asia by up to three hours, Jonathan Sivarajah, an El Al frequent flier and Israeli aviation commentator, told CNN.  He added that it ""opens up further opportunities [for the airlines], not only to Asia but potentially to Australia, too."" El Al's nonstop flight from Tel Aviv to Bangkok is currently listed as taking 10 hours 45 minutes. But a nonstop flight on Royal Jordanian from Amman -- 100 miles east of Tel Aviv -- takes eight hours 10 minutes. In fact, flying Tel Aviv to Amman, and then on to Bangkok can be quicker, even including transfer time at the airport -- a connecting flight can take as little as nine hours 55 minutes on Royal Jordanian. When the airline was banned from Saudi airspace, El Al flights from Tel Aviv to Mumbai took seven hours 45 minutes. That flight time was then slashed to five hours 15 minutes, before the route was put on hold.  As the announcement was made, El Al swiftly posted a map of their old and new routes to Southeast Asia on Instagram.  Sivarajah said that until now, competing international carriers have ""flooded"" Israel with quicker flights than what the country's own airlines were able to provide. ""Tel Aviv-bound foreign carriers such as Air India could operate over territory which El Al couldn't. There was a significant fare difference because of the routing in favor of the likes of Air India,"" he said.  ""It wasn't until the Abraham Accords [of 2020] and the Saudi approval that it became partly possible for Israeli carriers to compete. The last stumbling block was Oman."" He expects the new routings to start ""within the next few days."" In a statement, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it ""a day of great news for Israeli aviation."" He added: ""The Far East is not so far away and the skies are no longer the limit. ""We have worked to open the airspace, first over Saudi Arabia, and from 2018 when I visited Oman, to add Oman as well, so that we can fly directly to India and on to Australia. This was achieved today, after considerable effort, including in recent months. Here is good news -- Israel is opening up to the east on an unprecedented scale."" Israel's Foreign Minister Eli Cohen also released a statement, calling the news ""a historic decision that will shorten the road to Asia, lower costs for Israeli citizens and help Israeli airlines to be more competitive."" He personally thanked the sultan of Oman, Haitham bin Tariq al-Said, for his ""substantial help"" in the process. The announcement came after months of talks between the two countries.   It also follows an announcement earlier this month that El Al would start a frequent flier partnership with UAE carrier Etihad Airways. Frequent fliers can now collect and spend air miles across both airlines. The two had started codesharing on flights in 2021. Last year, El Al said that a route from Tel Aviv to Melbourne, Australia, was in the works.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",34,8.0,0.0,0.796,0.204,0.6249,0.031,0.908,0.061,0.972,21.2466,22.423127777777783,209.0,0.10728769271664011
Israel launches airstrikes on Gaza after rocket attacks as violence escalates,2023-02-23,"Israel launched airstrikes targeting alleged weapons manufacturing and storage sites in Gaza on Thursday, following a rocket attack from the coastal enclave, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said. In a statement, the IDF said ""fighter jets struck a weapons manufacturing site"" in central Gaza owned by Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that runs Gaza. ""In parallel, a military compound belonging to the Hamas Terrorist Organization in the northern Gaza Strip which also was used as a naval weapons storage warehouse was struck,"" the statement said. Earlier Thursday, the IDF said five rockets fired from Gaza toward Israeli territory, including the cities of Ashkelon and Sderot, were intercepted and another rocket fell in an open area.  The airstrikes come after the deaths of at least 11 Palestinians in Nablus in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday, which occurred during a raid by the Israeli military that also left at least 500 injured, Palestinian officials said Thursday. One of the dead targeted in the Nablus raid was a Hamas member, and two were Islamic Jihad commanders, the two militant groups said earlier. ""Our teams dealt with 488 injuries during the occupation forces' invasion into Nablus, including 103 injuries of live bullets taken to hospitals in Nablus,"" the Palestinian Red Crescent said. The other injuries included tear gas inhalation and shrapnel wounds, they said. The Palestinian Ministry of Health confirmed the numbers. The raid in Nablus lasted about four hours and, unusually, took place in broad daylight because the IDF said it had intelligence on where the suspects were. The IDF accused them of being responsible for the death of an Israeli soldier and of posing an imminent threat. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed Thursday that Israel would ""settle accounts with those who attack Israeli civilians and IDF soldiers,"" praising the previous day's Israeli military raid into Nablus. Netanyahu said that raid targeted ""three terrorists"" who ""shot and murdered Staff Sergeant Ido Baruch last October and they were about to carry out additional attacks against us."" ""I would like to commend the ISA and IDF Intelligence for the precise intelligence,"" that led to the raid, the Israeli prime minister said, referring to the Israeli Security Agency, the Shin Bet, and the Israel Defense Forces. He also thanked ""the soldiers who acted with heroism and confidence under fire."" The United Nations special coordinator for the Middle East peace process said late Wednesday he was ""appalled by the loss of civilian lives"" in the raid. ""I am deeply disturbed by the continuing cycle of violence,"" Tor Wennesland said in a statement. ""I urge all sides to refrain from steps that could further enflame an already volatile situation.""

Opinion: Netanyahu's 'reforms' are threatening the very foundations of Israel's democracy,2023-02-21,"So bewildering is the rush of news around the world today, and so radical is the discourse, that sober-minded observers are often inclined to take a step back and assume all angers will subside. But it would be a mistake to be sanguine about what's happening in Israel.  Those who care about the country, a technological and military power far beyond what its close to 10 million population suggests, should understand how dire this moment is. Israel's existence is in peril — certainly as a democracy and, in the longer term, as a viable economy and Jewish state. The context: The new far-right government of third-time Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which came to power after elections in November, is attempting to overhaul the system of checks and balances that has maintained political stability in the country. The Knesset, Israel's parliament, began debating the legislation Monday amid protests both in the chamber from opposition lawmakers and from tens of thousands outside. The self-inflicted damage would be breathtaking. The proposed reforms would subordinate the judicial system to the executive and to the leader of the executive branch, Netanyahu, who has a conflict of interest due to his ongoing corruption trial. (Netanyahu has repeatedly proclaimed his innocence and labeled the court proceedings against him a ""witch hunt."" Notably, he insisted throughout the 2022 campaign that no hasty and extreme assault on the judicial system, nor any machinations to end his trial, would take place.) The main issue is a proposed ""override clause"" enabling the Knesset, which because of Israel's electoral system is an extension of the executive, to veto court decisions. Also planned is legislation enabling the government to appoint the judiciary directly and politicize the civil service. In a country without a real constitution (instead, a series of ""basic laws"" that are easy to enact and alter) and with a unicameral parliament, this could easily mean the end of civil rights and minority guarantees. In other words, if a future government is not implementing dangerous abuses of power without judicial review — say, banning Palestinian or Arab citizens of Israel from voting — it would only be because it chooses not to do so. Netanyahu and his allies argue the Israeli people have spoken. But the ruling coalition won just a thin majority (64 seats out of 120) in the Knesset, resting largely on the fact that two opposition parties — which unwisely splintered — barely missed the 3.25% threshold for getting into parliament.  Polls show only about a quarter of people want the reforms implemented. Hundreds of thousands have joined demonstrations opposing them. Opponents include not only top judicial figures but also almost all the ex-heads of the security establishment — the military, the Mossad intelligence agency, the Shin Bet domestic security service and the police. A public letter signed by 400 of these officials warned of ""damage for generations."" The plans, as revealed, could go as far as to turn Israel into a Jewish version of Turkey or Hungary, authoritarian regimes led by fervent populists. After cowed courts, one could expect a muzzled media, attacks on liberal nongovernmental organizations and efforts to disenfranchise the 20% of Israeli citizens who identify as Palestinians or Arabs. Moreover, the court system has also been the main protector from total subjugation of some 3 million West Bank and East Jerusalem Palestinians — who have been in effect ruled by Israel for 55 years and lack the right to vote. Given this, plus separate but related plans to increase Jewish settlement activity and hand most dealings with the Palestinians to the country's top nationalists, the military warns a third Palestinian uprising is imminent. Prominent doomsayers include leading figures of the stunning technology sector, which accounts for a sixth of Israel's economy, a quarter of income tax revenue and half of exports. Hundreds of major multinationals have research centers in Israel, many of which are Fortune 500 companies. These companies — from Meta and Google to Intel and Apple — are a top driver of the economy.  S&P says the legislative reforms will negatively affect Israel's credit rating, while the former head of the Bank of Israel, a top JPMorgan Chase official, warns the country is in ""danger of losing everything."" Money has already begun flowing out of the country amid fears a collapse of rule of law would undermine contractual law and property rights.  Netanyahu's propaganda claims the courts have over the years overstepped their authority by preventing governability — a supposed plot by elites to impose leftism.  The truth is that over 75 years of Israeli statehood, the Supreme Court has intervened with laws just 22 times, mostly involving uncontroversial civil rights. Only three cases involved security issues.  Netanyahu's propaganda also claims Supreme Court judges currently ""self-select themselves."" But judges are appointed by Israel's President, from shortlists drawn up by three members of the nine-member Judicial Selection Committee, which includes three of the Court's justices alongside four politicians and two members of the Bar Association. Under the proposed system, however, the government would appoint them all, likely yielding toadies. Opponents of the plan speak of fleeing the country en masse should it succeed. Considering West Bank Palestinians' outrage over their disenfranchisement, some of Israel's remaining Arab enemies ready to pounce and the security establishment in uproar, the collective threat is clear. Across social media and on the streets, other frenzied opponents of the plan are speaking seriously of civil war. Benny Gantz, the ex-military chief and former defense minister, has warned of such a devastating possibility; former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett cautioned in a recent radio interview that a constitutional crisis looms. Should the government pass its reforms and then ignore a Supreme Court decision striking them down, key institutions like the Israeli military would not know where legitimacy lies, Bennett hypothesized. ""I am afraid we will reach bloodshed,"" he added, ""an internal rift that cannot be repaired."" Bennett — a nationalist, but a responsible one — is right. Israel's friends worldwide, and anyone interested in the stability of a nuclear power, would be wise to take note and speak up.  This is a rare moment in history — fascinating and horrifying in equal measure — when an important country in an unstable region is on the cusp of undoing itself.","{'neg': 0.254, 'neu': 0.746, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.5267}",44,10.0,0.12966666666666668,0.7786666666666666,0.09149999999999998,-0.04266,0.123,0.763,0.114,-0.7843,-1.8770399999999998,46.12301,184.0,0.25066853260869565
Space pods and flying dragons: How Saudi Arabia wants to transform its capital,2023-02-20,"It looks like a city out of a science fiction movie: Space pods, flying dragons and floating rocks. But this is the birthplace of Islam, Saudi Arabia, which wants to transform its capital into one of ""the most livable cities on Earth.""  The kingdom is building a new downtown in the capital Riyadh, its sovereign wealth fund announced on Friday. Spearheaded by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS), the ""New Murabba"" (new square) project is meant to expand the capital by some 19 square kilometers (4,695 acres) to accommodate hundreds of thousands of residents.  At the heart of the project is the ""Mukaab,"" a 400-meter (1,312-foot) high, 400-meter wide and 400-meter-long cube that is big enough to fit 20 Empire State buildings. It offers ""an immersive experience"" with landscapes changing from outer space to green vistas, according to Public Investment Fund (PIF), the MBS-led $620-billion sovereign wealth fund. The project is due to be completed in 2030.  Holographic technology is meant to offer ""a new reality"" to consumers as they shop and dine. The building also includes recreational facilities as well as hotels and residential units.  Saudi Arabia, which has been the subject of bad press for decades due to human rights violations, has embarked on an ambitious project to diversify the economy away from oil and shed its image as a conservative, closed-off state.   ""Back in the day, you would have negative discussions about Saudi Arabia affiliated to human rights abuses,"" said Andreas Krieg, research fellow at the King's College London Institute of Middle Eastern Studies. ""But now they're trying to push new narratives of being a country of development and one that can build futuristic cities.""   But some analysts say Saudi Arabia has serious regional competition from neighboring Dubai and the Qatari capital Doha, both of which have for decades tried to position themselves as regional tourism and investment hubs.  ""Being second in the race is always a tough place to start when you want to become the leader,"" said Simon Henderson, director of the Gulf and Energy Policy program at The Washington Institute. He added that it is particularly difficult for Saudi Arabia because ""they've spent decades not attracting foreign, non-Muslim visitors.""   But some have questioned whether the project will even come to fruition. Saudi Arabia has announced similar mega projects in the past, work on which has been slow.   In 2021, MBS announced his $500 billion futuristic Neom city in the northwest of the country, with promises of robot maids, flying taxis, and a giant artificial moon. And last year, he unveiled a giant linear city, the Line, which aimed to stretch over 106 miles and house 9 million people.  The kingdom already has an $800 billion plan to double the size of the capital in the next decade, as well as transform it into a cultural and economic hub for the region, according to Saudi media.  ""The more absurd and futuristic these projects get, the more I can't help but imagine how much more dystopian everything surrounding them will be,"" wrote Dana Ahmed, a Gulf researcher at Amnesty International, on Twitter.  Saudi officials have insisted that work on the projects is going ahead as planned.  It's unclear how much New Murabba will cost, or how PIF plans to finance it.   Asked about the cost and financing plans, PIF told CNN that details have not yet been disclosed and that it will announce further information in due course.  Some analysts are skeptical, saying that the kingdom may not be able to gather enough funding to fulfill its ambitions.   ""The finances of all of this are not entirely secured. They have tried to get a lot of foreign direct investments (FDI) to realize this project,"" said Krieg, adding that investment hasn't come in the way Riyadh may have hoped.  Saudi Arabia is hoping to raise its FDI to 388 billion riyals ($103 billion) annually by the year 2030. The kingdom's current FDI stands at $19 billion as of 2021, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development's (UNCTAD) 2022 World Investment report.  Whether the kingdom will be able finance the project also depends on the price of oil, said Henderson.  The price per barrel is currently in the low $80s, he said, noting that the kingdom may need oil prices to pass the $100-mark in order to finance national megaprojects.  While some mocked the new city and cast doubts about its viability, others pointed to the uncanny resemblance its cubic skyscraper has with Islam's holiest site in Mecca.   The Kaaba, the name of which comes from the same root as the name of the new Mukaab building, is the structure that billions of Muslims turn to for prayer five times a day, and to which millions make pilgrimage every year.  ""Building a new Kaaba exclusively devoted to capitalism is a little too on the nose,"" tweeted Murtaza Hussain, a journalist.  Turkey-Syria earthquake  The death toll from the Turkey-Syria earthquake continued to rise two weeks after it struck as Turkey ended its search and rescue operations in all but two affected provinces.  The number of those killed in Turkey rose to 41,156 by Monday, the country's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) said.  Turkey ended search operations in all but the provinces of Kahramanmaraş and Hatay, it announced on Sunday.  The combined death toll in Turkey and Syria is now 47,088.  Here's the latest:  The body of Ghana soccer star Christian Atsu arrived in Accra, Ghana, on Sunday evening after it was flown from Turkey, Ghana's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Regional Integration (MFA) said. Ghana's Vice President Mahamudu Bawumia and a large military procession met the coffin on arrival in Accra. 
At least 80% of the buildings in Turkey's Hatay province have to be rebuilt, the province's mayor said on Sunday. 
More than 105,000 buildings have been identified as collapsed or heavily damaged or about to collapse, according to Turkey's Vice President Fuat Oktay. 
The United States will bring in another $100 million to assist victims of the quake, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.  The digest  Israel's Netanyahu accuses Iran of attacking tanker in Persian Gulf region  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Iran on Sunday of attacking a tanker ship in the Persian Gulf region, apparently referring to the Israeli-affiliated Campo Square, which was lightly damaged on February 10, its management company said.   Background: The Campo Square ""was hit by an airborne object while in the Arabian Sea approximately 300 nautical miles off the coasts of India and Oman"" on the night of February 10, ship management company Eletson said in a statement, adding that there was minor damage to the vessel. The ship ""is owned by a Liberian company which is linked to the British company Zodiac Maritime Ltd.,"" Zodiac Maritime told CNN Sunday. The company's chairman, Eyal Ofer, is Israeli.  
Why it matters: It's the second time in less than three months that a tanker linked to Israel has been attacked off the coast of Oman. On November 15, the Pacific Zircon was struck by what the United States said was an Iranian-made drone.    Iran International TV moves studio out of UK after alleged threats from Tehran government  An independent Iranian TV station, Iran International, has moved its broadcasting studio from London to Washington DC at the advice of the London police after ""a significant escalation in state-backed threats from Iran,"" the station announced on Saturday. The UK's Head of Counter Terrorism Policing said on Saturday that police continue to respond to threats from Iran against UK-based individuals and a Persian-language media company it didn't name.  Background: Iran International TV gained significance since anti-government protests broke out across Iran in September, which was followed by Tehran restricting the internet and strictly controlling information in the country. Iran has accused Saudi Arabia of funding the channel, which its owners have denied. 
Why it matters: Iran has sanctioned Iran International's parent company Volant Media for ""supporting terrorism."" The channel was previously warned by UK authorities in November that their reporters were under increasing threats. A man was arrested near the station's London location on February 11 and charged with a terrorism offense, according to the statement.    Saudi Arabia says Arab states need new approach toward Syria  Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan said at a Munich security forum on Saturday that consensus was building in the Arab world that isolating Syria was not working and that dialogue with Damascus was needed ""at some point"" to at least address humanitarian issues, including a return of refugees, Reuters reported.  Background: Riyadh, which had cut off ties with the Syrian regime due to its brutal suppression of protests there, has sent aid planes to government-held territory in Syria as part of earthquake relief efforts. It was the first Saudi flight to a regime airport in more than a decade. 
Why it matters: The minister's remarks mark a shift from the early years of Syria's 12-year civil war when several Arab states, including Saudi Arabia, backed rebels that fought Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Shunned by the West, Assad has been basking in an outpouring of support from Arab states that normalized ties with him in recent years.    Around the region A popular Tunisian actor has invited controversy after declaring on television that he hates the hijab, the head covering worn by many Muslim women.  Mohamed Kouka made a hand gesture showing himself ripping off an imaginary hijab on Attessia TV, saying it denies women their humanity. ""It takes the value of women to the lowest, and I therefore have a hatred for the hijab,"" he said.  Other guests on the television show countered that the head covering is a personal choice. Many more took to social media to condemn the actor, accusing him of inciting against hijab-wearing women. A clip of his comments posted on Facebook by the channel garnered more than 13,000 comments, many of which opposed his position.  Former Tunisian health minister Abdellatif El Mekki wrote on his Facebook page, addressing the actor: ""You have a right not to be convinced by the hijab or anything else, but you don't have the right to say what you said, because at the least it is a lack of acceptance of differences, and it can be construed as incitement.""  Kouka later went on Mosaique FM to say he respects a woman's right to choose and that he doesn't hate women who wear the hijab. Asked why he said he would rip the hijab off, Kouka said it was ""a joke."" He refused to apologize.   The hijab is a sensitive topic in Tunisia. The wearing of the covering was severely restricted by the regime in the Muslim-majority country prior to the 2011 revolution that sparked the Arab Spring.

Protests across Israel as Netanyahu's government introduces bill to weaken courts,2023-02-20,"A controversial set of bills that would weaken the independence of Israel's judicial system passed its first reading in the Knesset, Israel's parliament, in the early hours of Tuesday morning local time. Both bills passed 63 to 47. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition government has 64 seats in the 120-member chamber. A bill must pass three readings in the Knesset to become law. Netanyahu's allies pressed forward with the legislation despite tens of thousands of Israelis demonstrating against the changes over the past seven weeks.  On Monday, protesters blocked roads in cities across Israel during demonstrations against Netanyahu's planned judicial reforms. Demonstrators in Jerusalem turned the streets around the Supreme Court and Knesset into a sea of Israeli flags, which organizers were handing out before the event began.  Among the protesters were a few dozen women dressed in long red dresses and white head coverings, like handmaids in the Margaret Atwood novel ""The Handmaid's Tale,"" along with drummers, horn-blowers and at least one juggler balancing an Israeli flagpole on his nose.  The Jerusalem demonstration was visibly smaller than one in the same location a week earlier, but still appeared to number about 75,000 people an hour and a quarter after it was scheduled to begin, crowd control expert Ofer Grinboim Liron told CNN. Liron is the CEO of Crowd Solutions, a company that specializes in crowd dynamics at events and venues. Protesters had begun to disperse by 4:30pm local time (9:30am ET), a CNN team there observed. The demonstration had largely finished early evening local time in Jerusalem. But soon after, chaotic scenes emerged inside the Knesset as the session to officially debate the bill for its first reading in parliament began.  Many opposition lawmakers from former Prime Minister Yair Lapid's Yesh Atid party raised Israeli flags in the chamber, some draping them over their shoulders, and shouted over government lawmaker Simcha Rothman as debate began. Knesset security took flags away from lawmakers and escorted some out of the chamber. The bills have so far sparked weeks of public protests, a plea from President Isaac Herzog to delay for negotiations, and a rare intervention into Israeli domestic politics by US President Joe Biden. Netanyahu's coalition is seeking the most sweeping overhaul of the Israeli legal system since the country's founding. The most significant changes would allow a simple majority in the Knesset to overturn Supreme Court rulings. The reforms also seek to change the way judges are selected, and remove government ministries' independent legal advisers, whose opinions are binding. US President Joe Biden has expressed concerns over the reforms, saying: ""The genius of American democracy and Israeli democracy is that they are both built on strong institutions, on checks and balances, on an independent judiciary. Building consensus for fundamental changes is really important to ensure that the people buy into them so they can be sustained."" On Sunday, Netanyahu defended the judicial reform. ""Israel is a democracy and will remain a democracy, with majority rule and proper safeguards of civil liberties,"" he said during an address to the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations.  ""All democracies should respect the will of other free peoples, just as we respect their democratic decisions. ""There's been a lot of rhetoric that is frankly reckless and dangerous, including calls for bloodshed in the streets and calls for a civil war. It isn't going to happen. There's not going to be a civil war,"" the Prime Minister added.

Thousands protest Netanyahu's plan to weaken Israel's judiciary as president warns of 'social collapse',2023-02-13,"Tens of thousands of flag-waving Israelis converged on the nation's parliament Monday, amid warnings that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plan to weaken the judiciary risks plunging the country into a ""social collapse.""  Protesters held signs with messages including ""there is no democracy without equality"" and ""destroying the country to avoid trial"" -- a reference to the perception that Netanyahu's desire to halt his corruption trials is behind his government's planned judicial reforms.  LGBTQ rainbow flags and a few Palestinian flags were sprinkled among many Israeli flags in the crowd.  Television pictures showed some demonstrators dressed as handmaids from the dystopian book ""The Handmaid's Tale,"" in long red dresses with white head coverings.  Despite the protest -- and an impassioned plea from President Isaac Herzog on Sunday night not to start the legislative process -- the government began introducing the reform bill in parliament, the Knesset, on Monday as planned. Herzog warned that Israel is ""on the brink of constitutional and social collapse,"" and possibly faces ""a violent collision.""  Chaotic scenes unfolded within the Knesset's Constitution, Law and Justice Committee meeting on the bill before the protest even got underway, as opposition members of parliament chanted ""shame.""  At one point some of them jumped over tables to yell at coalition members, before being removed by security.    The bill passed the committee vote and will face a first reading in the full Knesset, likely on Wednesday.   Netanyahu's coalition is seeking the most sweeping overhaul of the Israeli legal system since its founding.   The most significant of the changes would allow a simple majority in the Knesset to overturn Supreme Court rulings.   The reforms also seek to change the way judges are selected, and remove government ministries' independent legal advisors, whose opinions are binding.   US President Joe Biden, who rarely expresses an opinion on internal Israeli politics, called for consensus in a statement to the New York Times on Sunday: ""The genius of American democracy and Israeli democracy is that they are both built on strong institutions, on checks and balances, on an independent judiciary. Building consensus for fundamental changes is really important to ensure that the people buy into them so they can be sustained.""  Meanwhile in an unusual primetime address on Sunday evening, Israeli President Herzog called for a halt to the legislative process so that both sides could come together and work on reforms based on consensus.   Recognizing that both sides should have their voices heard, Herzog presented a five-point plan for reform which included changing the way judges are selected and strengthening elements of the country's Basic Law. Israel has no written Constitution.  Although the US praised Herzog's speech, Israeli Minister of Justice Yariv Levin said while there were ""positive elements in his proposal,"" there were ""also elements that perpetuate the existing abnormal situation.""  But Levin said the legislative action should not be halted for such talks, instead saying ""along with advancing the legislation, we all have enough time to be able to talk and reach understandings before the second and third readings.""  Netanyahu, speaking in a video message, accused opposition leaders of ""dragging the country into anarchy,"" urging them to ""show responsibility and leadership."" ""I call on the leaders of the opposition: stop it. Stop deliberately leading the country into anarchy. Get ahold of yourselves, show responsibility and leadership,"" Netanyahu said. ""Most Israeli citizens do not want anarchy. They want a substantive discussion and in the end they want unity."" Opposition leaders including former Prime Minister Yair Lapid and former Defense Minister Benny Gantz addressed the crowds earlier. Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute, said that if the legislation passes, it could result in ""a fundamental change in the nature of Israel"" that could have significant social implications down the road.   He said a standoff could occur if the Supreme Court decides to strike down the new legislation, which could then be overridden by parliament and the government, and that move in turn could be deemed illegal by the Supreme Court.   ""And then we will have a constitutional deadlock where there is no agreed upon mechanism for making a decision,"" he told CNN, adding that such a scenario isn't likely for now. ""This, I would say, is a threat that is looming, but we are yet to find out.""  The protests are likely to intensify as the bill advances through the Knesset, he said.  Israeli bills need three readings in the Knesset before becoming law.  Additional reporting by Amir Tal in Jerusalem and Nadeen Ebrahim in Abu Dhabi.

Second child dies in car ramming attack in Jerusalem,2023-02-10,"A car drove into several people at a bus stop in Jerusalem on Friday, killing a man and a young child in what Israeli police described as a ""ramming terror attack."" A second child died of his injuries Saturday. Yaakov Yisrael Paley, 6, and Alter Shlomo Lederman, 20, died Friday at the Ramot intersection, an area Israel considers to be a neighborhood in northern Jerusalem.  The boy's brother, 8-year-old Asher Menachem Paley, who was ""critically wounded"" during the attack, died in hospital on Saturday, according to a statement by the hospital, Shaare Zedek. He was pronounced dead after ""many teams from the trauma unit, from the ER, pediatric intensive care, pediatric surgery and neurosurgery fought for many hours for his life,"" according to the statement. The 42-year-old father of Asher and Yaakov was injured in the attack and remains in the hospital in ""moderate"" condition, according to Hadassah Medical Center. His 10-year-old son has been released ""after being treated in the emergency room by the medical team.""  Two other people were also injured in the incident. The suspect, who was ""neutralized"" at the scene, according to police, was identified as Hussein Qaraqe, a 31-year-old from east Jerusalem.  Local journalists in the neighborhood reported that Israeli police had arrested Qaraqe's wife, father and brother, sharing videos of what they said were the arrests. It occurred on land that Israel captured from Jordan in 1967 and then annexed, so Palestinians and many international observers consider it to be a settlement on occupied land. Suspect released from hospital just before attack The suspect, Qaraqe, had been released from a hospital in Tel Aviv the night before the incident, his uncle told CNN. He had been in hospitalized for a month due to a back injury, said Adnan Qaraqe. ""He had a car accident a while ago and severely injured his back which led to more than five surgeries on his spine. He was on very heavy medication and painkillers which affected his nervous system."" Qaraqe said he did not know if the hospital where his nephew had stayed was a mental hospital or whether Hussein was hospitalized for back pain. He said there would be records at his nephew's house that would clarify, but the house has been sealed by Israeli authorities. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave orders on Friday for the house to be sealed and demolished. Residents of Issawiya told CNN that Qaraqe was not the owner of the house, but had rented it. Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir also ordered police checks of vehicles in that neighborhood in the wake of the ramming -- and wanted to go further, he said at the scene of the incident. ""I instructed the police to set up roadblocks around Issawiya and stop one by one -- one by one -- and to simply check every vehicle.  I wanted to do a full closure, but there is a legal question about it - and we will discuss it.  In any case, I instructed the police to deploy roadblocks, and they are deploying roadblocks around Issawiya,"" he said. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday responded to the incident in a strongly worded statement on Friday, saying, ""We strongly condemn today's terrorist attack on civilians, including children, at a bus stop in Jerusalem and express our condolences to the families of those killed."" ""The deliberate targeting of innocent civilians is repugnant and unconscionable. The United States extends our deepest sympathies to the injured, and we stand firmly with them in the face of this attack,"" the statement read.","{'neg': 0.279, 'neu': 0.721, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.4767}",26,14.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.121,0.843,0.036,-0.9914,0.0,-77.482315,200.0,-0.387411575
Opinion: Mitt Romney's moments of truth,2023-02-12,"More than a decade has passed since Mitt Romney lost political support during his failed 2012 presidential campaign for boasting about having ""binders full of women"" suitable for government appointments and writing off the ""47% of Americans"" who pay no federal income tax.  But his remark about Russia being America's ""number one geopolitical foe"" — which was widely ridiculed at the time — now seems prescient in the wake of Vladimir Putin's murderous invasion of Ukraine.  In the past few years, the senator from Utah has earned a reputation for being a rare, candid voice in Washington, willing to buck his party. He was the lone Republican who voted to remove President Donald Trump from office in his first impeachment trial and one of seven to do so in Trump's second impeachment.  Minutes before the State of the Union speech Tuesday, Romney encountered the scandal-ridden Republican Rep. George Santos on the House floor and told him what many of the New York congressman's constituents — and others around the country — are saying: ""You don't belong here."" (Santos told reporters afterward: ""It wasn't very Mormon of him."") Even more tellingly, Romney broke with his party's stance on China's spy balloon. After a closed-door briefing by administration officials Thursday, Romney told reporters, ""I believe that the administration, the president, our military and intelligence agencies, acted skillfully and with care,"" and said he agreed with their decision to wait to shoot down the balloon until it moved over the Atlantic Ocean, off the Carolinas.  House Republicans, who were initially planning a resolution condemning the Biden administration for not bringing down the balloon sooner, switched the wording to condemn the government of China for sending the craft over US territory in the first place.  It passed 419-0, a small act of bipartisanship only two days after a group of House Republicans heckled President Joe Biden as he was addressing both houses in his annual speech. There are not a lot of Romneys — or indeed any — in the ranks of the extreme GOPers who bucked their own House Speaker's shushing to shout their displeasure at Biden's remarks. ""Some members of the Republican caucus seemed keen to highlight the distinctions between the thoughtful, unity-emphasizing Biden and their own party's shameful descent,"" wrote Jill Filipovic. ""Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, among others, repeatedly booed and yelled throughout the speech; when he introduced the parents of Tyre Nichols, who was last month fatally beaten by Memphis police officers, and the Ukrainian ambassador, she stayed seated. That perhaps says more than Biden ever could."" Shushing SE Cupp called McCarthy's ""shushing"" a ""surprisingly gallant act of leadership from someone who has aligned himself with former President Donald Trump, voted to overturn the 2020 election results and packed the House Oversight Committee with election deniers.""  ""Will he continue to 'shush' the extremist, conspiratorial and 'Never Biden' wing of his party — whom he has empowered and elevated — as they act out and get in the way of his agenda, which might even include working with Biden from time to time?"" Geoff Duncan, a Republican who formerly served as Georgia's lieutenant governor, wrote that ""neither the southern border nor inflation received much attention from the president — despite both issues being of importance to voters. Neither did the Chinese spy balloon, whose coast-to-coast journey undermines Biden's tough talk toward Chinese President Xi Jinping.""  Biden ""was feisty, full of energy, marshaled his arguments effectively and even batted back Republican catcalls with good humor,"" observed David Gergen. ""By the end of the evening, he looked like a boxer who can't wait to get into the ring again."" ""But he now faces an even sterner test: Did he actually move the needle? Among presidents of the recent past, a public appearance as powerful as this one could shake up politics. Former Presidents Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan each had the capacity to change minds when they held a microphone.""  The president's ""discussion of 'the talk' that Black parents give to their children about how to safely interact with police officers was the most moving part of his speech,"" wrote former Rep. Mondaire Jones, a Democrat.  ""Still, it was political malpractice for him not to explicitly call for Congress to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. The family of Tyre Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man who was fatally beaten by Memphis police officers last month, deserved to hear it.""   Populism Raul Reyes noted that ""Biden smartly aligned himself with populist issues, like making wealthy corporations pay their fair share of taxes and proposing that all federal infrastructure projects use American-made materials.""   The 80-year-old president's vision was decidedly blue-collar — and 20th century — in its aim to rebuild America's manufacturing base and reduce the reliance on trade with the rest of the world.  But, as Julian Zelizer pointed out, ""times have changed and Biden has a tough road ahead. While the president offered a robust vision of how federal investment has and could create jobs in key sectors such as the semi-conductor industry and infrastructure, the kinds of manufacturing jobs that were at the heart of federal investment between the 1930s and 1960s have vastly diminished and are not likely to return.""  ""Biden needs to acknowledge how his economic populism will address the industries of the 2020s rather than those of the 1950s and 1960s.""  Biden's success in 2020 owed a lot to the contrast with the chaos and extremism of the Trump administration, Bill McGowan and Juliana Silva wrote. The outbursts by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and her colleagues allow Biden to surf the same wave now. ""By keeping the hostility factor high, the GOP is also paving the way for Biden to reuse in 2024 one of his stickiest and most effective campaign messages from 2020: that the election is nothing short of a battle for the 'soul of the nation.' Thanks to the new breed of attention-seeking, far-right Republicans, Biden gets to go back to that well regardless of whether Trump is his opponent or not.""  The president turned the heckling to his advantage by getting Republicans to deny any intention of cutting Social Security or Medicare. ""You can say Mr. Biden fibbed, misled and exaggerated, and you wouldn't be wrong,"" Peggy Noonan wrote in the Wall Street Journal, ""but in rope-a-doping Republicans on Medicare and Social Security he showed real mastery.""  New generation? In ""a scathing rebuke"" to Biden's speech that served as the GOP's official reply, ""Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said it's time for a new generation of Republican leadership,"" Alice Stewart noted. ""At 40, Sanders is the youngest governor in the country. She spoke of Biden as the oldest president in American history, and at 80-years-old, she said, he is simply 'unfit to serve as commander in chief.'"" Left unsaid was that Trump, Sanders' former boss, would be 78 by Election Day, 2024 — and he is running for the presidency again. Patrick T. Brown spoke for a lot of Americans when he pleaded for something other than a Biden-Trump rematch: ""A 2024 presidential election that features another slugfest between two elderly leaders rather than a scrappy fight between up-and-coming politicians with energy and enthusiasm would be doing the nation a disservice."" ""New polling suggests a growing desire for new faces. 58% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters told a Washington Post/ABC News poll they hoped their party nominates someone other than Biden in 2024. According to the poll, 49% of Republican and Republican-leaning voters said the same thing about former President Donald Trump.""

A devastating earthquake had struck and they hurried out of the building in their pajamas into snow-filled streets. Taking refuge in their car, away from any buildings, Alomar spoke to CNN Opinion's Sheena McKenzie about the toll the quake is taking on a region already devastated by war.  Alomar is a pediatrician who works as a senior health adviser with the Syrian American Medical Society, providing medical assistance across the border. ""In northwest Syria, we are already suffering from a shortage of supplies, and we are now using the regular inventories in our warehouses,"" Alomar said. ""So we are in urgent need of additional support to compensate these supplies for regular operations — and also to be ready for aftershocks and more casualties who may come to our hospitals.""  In the New York Times, Turkish author and Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk wrote, ""Aid has been dispatched, but the trucks loaded with supplies are stuck for hours on jammed roads hundreds of miles from the affected areas. People who have lost their homes, their families, their loved ones, everything they ever had find that there is nobody doing anything about the fires beginning to break out in their cities. And so they block the path of any official vehicle, policeman or government employee they can find and start to remonstrate. I have never seen our people so angry."" As of Sunday, the death toll in the quake stood at more than 28,000, with tens of thousands injured. Zelensky, a year later A year ago, shortly before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, former comedian-turned-president ""Volodymyr Zelensky's popularity ratings were tanking as he battled allegations of unmet campaign promises to tackle endemic corruption,"" recalled Michael Bociurkiw.  ""Then on February 24, Russia's total invasion blasted these concerns into the background. Almost overnight, that dark cloud over Zelensky vanished as he defied critics, and miraculously pivoted into the role of heroic wartime president and global symbol of defender of the free world."" ""His popularity ratings surged — and have stayed high ever since — currently hovering at around 84%."" But corruption is still pervasive in Ukraine, as recent allegations and a new crackdown have shown, and Bociurkiw argued that it's vital to keep fighting it. ""Zelensky needs to respond to allegations of wrongdoing with the same determination that Ukrainian servicemen have demonstrated on the battlefield."" ""This is an opportunity to create a nation where corruption is not tolerated, and where oligarchs no longer have a free hand to rape and pillage the economy.""

Opinion: Why Netanyahu is suddenly a lot less friendly with Putin,2023-02-07,"Long before the current war in Ukraine began nearly a year ago, Israel has maintained strict neutrality in the hostilities between Russia and Ukraine. That may be about to change.   Since he came to power at the end of 1999, Russian President Vladimir Putin has gone out of his way to court the Israeli leadership. He made sure to hold a meeting at least once a year with the serving Israeli prime minister, usually at his residences in Sochi or Moscow, and every few years he would travel to Jerusalem. A former Russian diplomat explained to me that ""Putin respects strength and sees Israel as a strong country with which he wants to be on good terms."" The same is true of Israel's leaders, especially of Benjamin Netanyahu, the country's longest-serving prime minister who returned to office at the end of 2022.  Netanyahu was so proud of what he claimed was a close relationship with Putin that in 2019 he used photographs of them together as part of his election campaign. He has claimed on multiple occasions that their relationship was advantageous to Israel's strategic interests. One instance of this was when Russia first deployed its military to war-torn Syria in September 2015 to prop up President Bashar Assad's blood-soaked regime. Within days, Netanyahu was in Moscow at the head of a military delegation for an unscheduled meeting with Putin. The two leaders reached an agreement whereby Israel would continue to operate in Syrian airspace but would only attack targets linked to its enemy Iran, while leaving Assad's forces untouched. A ""deconfliction mechanism,"" including a hotline between the Russian command center in Syria and Israel's air force headquarters, was swiftly established. Over the years, senior Israeli officials have been at pains to emphasize that while Israel's chief strategic ally remains the United States, it was crucial to maintain coordination with the Russians.  In 2014, despite pressure from Washington, Israel refused to join the western governments in condemning Russia's annexation of Crimea. Strict neutrality was to be maintained throughout. When Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24 last year, Netanyahu was not in office. The prime minister was Naftali Bennett and he stuck to the neutrality policy.  Bennett explained to me that ""we are not in the same position as other countries. We have Russia just over our border in Syria. We have to take into consideration the presence of large Jewish communities in both Russia and Ukraine which could be impacted. And besides, it's useful for everyone to have a government like Israel which has good ties with both sides to serve as a go-between.""  In the early weeks of the war, Bennett embarked on a peace mission in which he both visited Putin in the Kremlin and had multiple conversations with Ukrainian President Vlodymyr Zelensky. He insists that ""there was a 50% chance of reaching a ceasefire, sadly it failed."" He also claims that his involvement helped broker short-term local truces, which allowed saving civilians from the war zone.  Any hope of a ceasefire has long vanished, and Ukraine has since publicly requested Israel help supply it with arms, especially with missile defense systems like the Iron Dome. Israel has sent humanitarian aid but has refused to send any weapons.  In recent months, as Russia began using Iranian drones to attack Ukrainian targets, Israel has agreed to supply Kyiv, through NATO, with intelligence and technical information on how to counter the Iranian drone threat. Not everyone in the Israeli leadership agreed with Bennett's neutral policy. His political partner and then-foreign minister Yair Lapid was more forthright in publicly condemning Russian war crimes in Ukraine.  Opinions were divided in the country's security establishment as well. One Israeli general told me that ""the fear of Russia is overblown and Israel could have been much more supportive of Ukraine without any fear of retribution."" Ten months after the Russian invasion, Netanyahu returned to office. Suddenly he was a lot less friendly toward Putin. He took one congratulatory phone call from him a week before his inauguration, but that was all. Meanwhile, in media interviews, he has said that he is reconsidering Israel's policy on the Ukraine war, though he wouldn't specify any details. ""Netanyahu has two immediate reasons for changing policy and supporting Ukraine,"" a former Israeli intelligence officer who was deeply involved in Israel's military relationship with Russia, told me. ""First, Russia has greatly diluted its forces in Syria as they were needed in Ukraine. The threat to Israel from them is now negligible,"" the officer said. ""Second, Russia is now using Iranian drones and missiles on the battlefield and Israel now has a valuable opportunity to supply Ukraine with defense systems so we can see how well they do in an actual war. One day we may have to face the same Iranian weapons,"" the officer added.  An Israeli diplomat adds another reason why Netanyahu would consider supporting Ukraine more forcefully. Unlike the Bennett-Lapid government, his new coalition of far-right and ultra-religious parties is regarded with suspicion by the Biden administration that has already voiced its displeasure with the new government's plans for a legal overhaul, which drastically weaken the powers and independence of Israel's supreme court. Last week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Jerusalem, and unlike on such visits in the past, didn't extend the Prime Minister an invitation to the White House. An Israeli shift toward Kyiv could be Netanyahu's best hope of currying favor with Washington.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.756, 'pos': 0.244, 'compound': 0.4417}",43,16.0,0.0,0.8651428571428571,0.13485714285714284,0.70135,0.089,0.782,0.129,0.983,30.158050000000003,47.87327500000001,193.0,0.2480480569948187
Powerful quake kills thousands in Turkey and Syria,2023-02-06,"Our live coverage of the major earthquake in Turkey and Syria has moved here. The leaders of Australia and New Zealand on Monday announced a combined total of $11.5 million in aid for victims of the devastating earthquake in Turkey and Syria. During a joint news conference in Canberra on Tuesday, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the country would provide an initial $10 million in humanitarian assistance through the Red Cross, Red Crescent and humanitarian agencies.  ""Australia's assistance will target those in greatest need."" he said. New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins, who is on his first state visit to Australia, said Wellington would contribute $1.5 million.  In a statement Tuesday, New Zealand Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta said the ""humanitarian contribution will support teams from the Turkish Red Crescent and Syrian Arab Red Crescent to deliver essential relief items such as food supplies, tents and blankets, and provide lifesaving medical assistance and psychological support."" Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Agency (AFAD) is urging people to stay off the roads to help search and rescue efforts following the earthquake. ""Please leave the roads open and do not go into traffic unless necessary so the search and rescue teams and the emergency vehicles that are directed to the earthquake zones can carry out their work,"" the agency tweeted Monday.   At least 300,000 blankets, 24,712 beds, and 19,722 tents have been sent to affected earthquake areas, AFAD said.  AFAD said in order to provide ""psycho-social"" support services to affected individuals, 765 personnel workers and 50 vehicles were dispatched to affected earthquake areas.   ##Turkey## The first of two Indian disaster relief teams left for Turkey on Monday night, according to the Indian Air Force. The Indian Air Force tweeted Tuesday that a C-17, a strategic transport aircraft, left for Turkey “bearing search and rescue teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF).” India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) tweeted a similar post, writing, “The first batch of earthquake relief material leaves for Türkiye, along with NDRF Search and Rescue Teams, specially trained dog squads, medical supplies, drilling machines and other necessary equipment.” The rescue efforts come in the wake of a deadly earthquake that struck Turkey and Syria on Monday. Soon after, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered his condolences with his office saying in a statement that “relief material would be dispatched immediately” in coordination with the Turkish government. ""Two teams of NDRF comprising 100 personnel with specially trained dog squads and necessary equipment are ready to be flown to the earthquake hit area for search and rescue operations,"" the statement said. ""Medical teams are also being readied with trained doctors and paramedics with essential medicines. Relief material will be dispatched in coordination with the Government of Republic of Türkiye and Indian Embassy in Ankara and Consulate General office in Istanbul."" India’s Minister of External Affairs S. Jaishankar also extended his condolences, tweeting  Monday night that he had contacted his Syrian counterpart, Faisal Mekdad. “Expressed solidarity and conveyed our support including through supply of medicines,” he tweeted. ##Turkey## At least 100 aftershocks measuring 4.0 or greater have occurred since the 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck southern Turkey on Monday morning local time, according to the United States Geological Survey. As the time from the original earthquake extends, the frequency and magnitude of the aftershocks tend to decrease. However, 5.0 to 6.0-plus aftershocks are still likely to occur and bring a risk of additional damage to structures that are compromised from the original earthquake. This brings a continued threat to rescue teams and survivors. The aftershocks stretch for more than 300 kilometers (186 miles) along the fault zone that ruptured in southern Turkey, oriented from southwest to northeast and stretching from the border with Syria up through the province of Malatya. ##Turkey## Planes carrying aid shipments from Iraq and Iran arrived at Damascus International Airport after a magnitude 7.8 earthquake devastated Turkey and Syria, Syrian state media SANA reported. The Iranian aid arrived on Monday and the Iraqi aid was delivered early Tuesday morning local time, SANA reported. Mahdi Ghanem, an official at the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told SANA that each plane carried about 70 tons of food, medical supplies, blankets and necessary supplies. On Monday, Iraq's Prime Minister Mohammed S. Al-Sudani announced they would send a shipment of emergency medical supplies, first aid and shelter supplies as well as medicine and fuel. Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian told Syrian Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad he would dispatch humanitarian aid to the area, Iranian state media IRNA reported. ##Syria## Japan has sent the country’s Disaster Relief Rescue Team in response to the earthquake in Turkey, according to a Monday statement by Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. “Upon the request of the Government of Turkey, and in light of humanitarian perspective and Japan’s friendship relations with Turkey, Japan has decided to provide this emergency assistance to Turkey to meet its humanitarian needs,” the statement read. The Disaster Relief Rescue Team departed for Turkey on Monday night to support search and rescue operations, the statement read. ##Turkey## At least 4,372 deaths have been confirmed after a powerful magnitude 7.8 earthquake rocked Turkey and Syria early Monday. Turkey's toll rose to 2,921 as of Tuesday morning, according to Yunus Sezer, Turkey’s head of disaster services. A total of 15,834 injuries have been reported, Sezer said in a news conference in Ankara. Sezer said he would provide a more comprehensive update at 6 a.m. local time (10 p.m. ET). In Syria, 1,451 deaths and 3,531 injuries have been reported by officials. ##Syria## ##Turkey## The Los Angeles County Fire Department is sending 78 members of their Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) team to Turkey after the country experienced devastating earthquakes Monday, the department announced in a news release.  At the request of the Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance (BHA), the fire department is sending the USAR team, known as USA-2, and an additional seven personnel members to assist operations, they said.  The team will depart Monday evening and may be deployed for two weeks or longer, the department said.  “This USAR team is the best of the best and will be instrumental in saving lives and rescuing people who continue to be stuck under rubble,” said Kathryn Barger, Los Angeles County fifth district supervisor, in a release. The USAR team includes rescue specialists, physicians, K-9 search teams and structural engineers who have spent a lot of time training for these events, Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said during a news conference Monday evening.   “This team is highly skilled and elite in urban search and rescue and is specially trained to assist in rescue efforts, especially in earthquakes like the one that just struck central or southeast Turkey,” Marrone said.  One of the team's biggest concerns is how they are going to be able to get to the areas in Turkey that need help after so much infrastructure collapsed during the quake, North Region Deputy Fire Chief Tom Ewald said. The United States Agency for International Development is currently working on those logistics, he added.   The Los Angeles USAR team will be joined by the Virginia Task Force 1, which is sending a crew of 79 members and six dogs to Turkey, the team tweeted on Monday. ##Turkey## The weather and the scale of the disaster are creating challenges for aid teams, according to Turkish Health Minister Fahrettin Koca, who spoke during a news conference carried out live on CNN Turk on Monday evening from Hatay Emergency Coordination Center.    “The weather conditions and the scale of the disaster make it hard for our teams to reach the region,” Koca said, adding “our helicopters could not take off today due to weather conditions.”    ""Heavy snowstorms have also recently hit parts of Syria and Türkiye, with further sub-zero temperatures forecasted,"" UNICEF said in a statement released on Monday.    All state institutions have been mobilized in the recovery effort, including the national police, municipal workers, the Disaster and Emergency Management Agency and the Gendarmerie, an armed general law enforcement organization part of Interior Ministry that maintains security and safety.    At least 2,256 emergency health personnel workers have so far reached earthquake-affected provinces, the health minister said.    At least 602 ambulances and two ambulance planes have been dispatched from neighboring cities. Also, 187 teams part of Turkey’s National Medical Rescue Team (UMKE) have also been dispatched.  “We have moved teams from surrounding provinces to the region,” the minister said.    Iskenderun State Hospital, a hospital in the city of Iskenderun, collapsed due to the earthquake.  “We are trying to save the medical workers and patients there,” Koca said. “These sorts of disasters can only be overcome with solidarity.”  ##Turkey## UNICEF says that thousands of homes have likely been destroyed following an earthquake in Turkey and Syria on Monday. ""Thousands of homes are likely to have been destroyed, displacing families and exposing them to the elements at a time of year when temperatures regularly drop below freezing and snow and freezing rain are common. Heavy snowstorms have also recently hit parts of Syria and Türkiye, with further sub-zero temperatures forecasted,"" UNICEF said in a statement. At least 3,830 deaths have been confirmed after a powerful magnitude 7.8 earthquake rocked Turkey and Syria early Monday.  In Turkey alone, at least 5,606 buildings collapsed, according to Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Agency. There are reports of similar devastation in northern Syria. It is also likely that hospitals and schools, along with other medical and education facilities, were ""damaged or destroyed,"" UNICEF said. UNICEF is working with the Turkish government and Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management on the ""emerging needs linked to the wider humanitarian response,"" the statement said, adding that the group is also preparing to support efforts in Syria. ""Children in Syria continue to face one of the most complex humanitarian situations in the world. A worsening economic crisis, continued localized hostilities after more than a decade of grinding conflict, mass displacement and devastated public infrastructure have left two-thirds of the population in need of assistance... waterborne diseases pose another deadly threat to children and families affected,"" UNICEF said. ##Syria## ##Turkey## South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol sent condolences to “the people of Turkiye and Syria” and offered to help Turkey. “Korea sends our deepest condolences to those who have lost their loved ones,” he tweeted. “We stand ready to assist Turkiye, a brotherhood forged in blood during the Korean War, in any way possible.""  ##Turkey## ##Syria## US President Joe Biden “reaffirmed” that the United States is ready to help Turkey in the aftermath of a recent earthquake and “expressed condolences on behalf of the American people"" when he spoke with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Monday, according to a readout of the call provided by the White House. Biden said the US was ready to “provide any and all needed assistance to our NATO Ally Turkey in response to this tragedy,” according to the White House. “President Biden expressed condolences on behalf of the American people to those who were injured or lost loved ones in the earthquakes.”  “He noted that U.S. teams are deploying quickly to support Turkish search and rescue efforts and coordinate other assistance that may be required by people affected by the earthquakes, including health services or basic relief items,” the readout added. US Ambassador to Turkey Jeff Flake said Monday two US search and rescue units will be sent to Turkey to assist with search and rescue efforts. US Agency for International Development Administrator Samantha Power said in a statement that these will be USAID Urban Search and Rescue teams from Fairfax County, Virginia, and Los Angeles County, California, Fire Departments.  Power said the agency has already deployed a Disaster Assistance Response Team which is ""assessing the situation, identifying priority humanitarian needs, and working to provide search and rescue,"" according to the statement. The two additional USAID teams on the way will coordinate with authorities in Turkey and ""other responding organizations to provide life-saving assistance,"" Power said in the statement. The medical organization Doctors Without Borders — also known as Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) — responded to ""overwhelming needs"" following the devastating earthquake in Turkey and Syria, according to a statement from the organization.  ""Following the powerful earthquakes that hit southern Turkey and northwestern Syria on February 6, 2023, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams working in northwestern Syria have mobilized with local partners to respond to the increasing needs in the area,"" the statement read.  The statement noted a staff member of MSF was found dead under rubble and others lost family members following the disaster.  “We are very shocked and saddened by the impact of this disaster on the thousands of people touched by it, including our colleagues and their families,” said Sebastien Gay, MSF head of mission in Syria.  Gay said medical facilities are overwhelmed by impact and ""medical personnel in northern Syria [are] working around the clock to respond to the huge numbers of wounded arriving to the facilities."" ""[In] the first hours [of the disaster], our teams treated around 200 wounded and we received 160 casualties in the facilities and the clinics that we run or support in northern Idlib. Our ambulances are also deployed to assist [people]."" he said.  “The needs are very high in northwestern Syria as this [earthquake] adds a dramatic layer for vulnerable [people] who are still struggling after many years of war,” Gay said. “The massive consequences of this disaster will require a [scaled up] international aid effort.”  The statement also said the number of deaths and injuries are increasing by the hour.  ""MSF remains in close contact with the local authorities in northwestern Syria and with the authorities in Turkey to extend our support where it’s needed. We are currently assessing the situation and needs in Idlib, northern Aleppo, and southern Turkey to scale up our response accordingly,"" the statement read.  ##Syria##  More than 3,800 people have died and thousands more were injured after a massive earthquake rocked Turkey and Syria on Monday morning.  The magnitude 7.8 quake was one of the strongest to strike the area in more than a century. Amid severe aftershocks, Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Agency (AFAD) called for international help. Here's what to know: The latest: At least 3,830 people have been killed and more than 15,000 injured in Turkey and Syria, according to officials. Following the initial quake, the US Geological Survey recorded at least 77 aftershocks, including a major one at 7.5 magnitude. Three of the aftershocks have measured 6.0 or greater.
Damage: At least 5,606 buildings collapsed in Turkey during and after the quake, according to Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Agency. There are reports of similar devastation in northern Syria. UN's Humanitarian Coordinator in Syria, El-Mostafa Benlamlih, told CNN many buildings collapsed – and more could still fall. First-hand accounts: Eyewitnesses described ""terrifying"" conditions in northwest Syria. The quake left “entire families dead” and “survivors sleeping on the streets in the freezing cold,” they said. CNN journalist Eyad Kourdi, who was in Turkey, described the power of the earthquake as ""biblical,"" saying, ""The force felt like somebody trying to knock me over.""
Challenges in Syria: More than 4 million people rely on humanitarian assistance in the region where the quake struck, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The majority are women and children. Along with the devastation from the earthquake, Syrian communities are battling an ongoing cholera outbreak amid a harsh winter with heavy rain and snow over the weekend, Search and rescue efforts have been hampered by a ""lack of heavy equipment and machinery to clear the rubble,"" according to the UN's Humanitarian Coordinator in Syria, El-Mostafa Benlamlih. Much of the area is controlled by anti-government forces amid a bloody civil war that began in 2011.
International support: The European Union activated its crisis response mechanism in order to provide faster support to Turkey and Syria. The United States will send two search and rescue units to Turkey, ambassador Jeff Flake said. Palestinian civil defense and medical teams will be sent to Turkey and Syria to help in rescue operations, Palestinian Authority's Prime Minister Muhammad Shtayyeh said. Iraq has also said it will send aid to earthquake victims, according to the country's prime minister.
Russian assistance: Ten units of the Russian army with a total of more than 300 soldiers are involved in clearing debris and helping in search and rescue operations in Syria. Russia is the strongest foreign power operating in Syria, and Putin has long allied himself with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, throwing the full weight of the Russian military behind the Syrian Army. 
Archeological sites damaged: Several archeological sites in Syria were damaged by the quake, experts said. In Turkey, the tremor badly damaged Gaziantep Castle, a historic site and tourist attraction in southeastern Turkey.
How you can help: The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) says it is “launching immediate cash assistance” from its Disaster Response Emergency Fund to help relief efforts in both Turkey and Syria. CNN’s Impact Your World has gathered ways to help victims. You can read about that here. ##Catch Up## At least 3,830 deaths have been confirmed after a powerful magnitude 7.8 earthquake rocked Turkey and Syria early Monday. The total death toll in Turkey has climbed to 2,379, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said. In Syria, 711 deaths were reported in government-controlled areas, according to state news agency SANA. The Syrian Civil Defense, known as the ""White Helmets,” reported there were 740 deaths in areas controlled by the opposition. The total number of injured climbed to 3,531 across Syria and 14,483 in Turkey. ##Syria## ##Turkey## Two search and rescue units from the United States will be sent to Turkey to assist with the aftermath of the earthquake, US Ambassador to Turkey Jeff Flake told CNN on Monday. “There will be two teams from the US. One from Fairfax County and another from Los Angeles — what they call these heavy units, each with I think 70 personnel with search dogs as well as paramedics,” Flake said. “That’s what we are told is needed.” Flake said that Turkey is going to need help with destroyed structures, saying that the last he knew was that 28 buildings were either down or partially damaged. Secretary of State Antony Blinken also spoke with his counterpart on Monday, the State Department said. “Secretary Blinken and Foreign Minister [Mevlüt] Çavuşoğlu discussed ways the United States and our partners could best assist. Secretary Blinken confirmed our initial assistance response was already underway and pledged to do all that we can in coordination with Türkiye to assist the victims of the earthquake in both Türkiye and Syria,” State Department Spokesperson Ned Price said.  In terms of getting support into Syria, Flake noted there are a number of humanitarian and church groups the US has worked in the country. He said it makes it “doubly difficult” that there is no functioning government in Syria.  Flake suggested that Americans direct donations through the Red Cross, non-profits and church groups if they want to help. ##Turkey## As the death toll rises and rescue workers continue to search for survivors, thousands more seek shelter after their homes were destroyed or damaged too badly to be safe.  Here are some of the images we've seen as darkness falls across the region.  ##Turkey## ##Syria## Syrians urgently need assistance after a 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit part of the country and Turkey early Monday, United Nations' Envoy for Syria Geir O. Pedersen said. ""Syrians urgently need global assistance,"" Pederson said. ""I reiterate the Secretary-General's call on the international community to help the thousands suffering from loss. Syrians urgently need global assistance,"" Pederson said. ##Syria## The death toll across Turkey and Syria has risen to at least 3,452 after a powerful 7.8 magnitude earthquake rocked southern Turkey early Monday. The total number of injured in Turkey and Syria climbed to 15,762 on Monday. The total death toll in Turkey has climbed to 2,316, according to Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Agency (AFAD).  The total death toll in Syria rose to 1,136. SANA reports 656 across government-controlled areas and the ""White Helmets"" group, officially known as the Syria Civil Defense, reported 480 deaths in opposition-controlled areas. Turkey has at least 13,293 and Syria has 2,469 injured people following the devastating earthquake. ##Turkey## ##Syria## Iraq has announced it will send aid to earthquake victims in Turkey and Syria, according to a statement released Monday from Iraq's prime minister, Mohammed S. Al-Sudani.   ""Iraq set up today an air bridge to both Syria and Turkiye to send urgent relief aid, which includes emergency medical supplies, first aid, and shelter supplies and medicine and fuel,"" Al-Sudani explained.   ""These efforts align with the Iraqi commitment to humanitarian cooperation with brotherly and friendly peoples and solidarity with the victims of the humanitarian disaster,"" the prime minister said.   Following the order of al-Sudani, Iraqi Military transport aircraft sent the first shipment of humanitarian, medical, and food aid to Damascus Airport in Syria, the Iraqi defense ministry said in a statement on Monday.   The defense ministry said this is ""to alleviate the burden of the crisis that Syria is going through after the catastrophe of the earthquake that struck,"" Turkey and Syria.    The situation in Syria is ""really tough"" after a devastating earthquake hit the region on Monday, the UN's Humanitarian Coordinator in Syria, El-Mostafa Benlamlih, told CNN. ""The search and rescue is hampered by the situation here where there is a lack of heavy equipment and machinery to clear the rubble,"" he said. ""The situation in Syria is really, really, tough. Beyond the crisis that we have been given, it's not easy to import things.... It's not easy to find spare parts for that equipment. And nobody expected this anyway – so it wasn't at the top of priorities.""  Benlamlih said the work will continue, “and we have teams in Aleppo and Hama, and other places trying to assess the situation."" Many buildings collapsed around northwest Syria during the earthquake, and more could still fall, Benlamlih said. ""Buildings in those places are already very vulnerable, and it might not be a surprise to have other buildings coming down. Particularly as we're facing also very tough conditions of work with the rain, and with the snow that is I think expected tonight in all of northwest Syria,"" Benlamlih said. ""Many people are very scared. They don't want to go back to their houses if we can call them houses, in these cases,"" Benlamlih said, ""They are afraid of the tremors. So they are spending their nights in freezing temperatures."" Benlamlih said that the UN has a stock of supplies they have been distributed, but more supplies are needed. ##Syria## At least 5,606 buildings collapsed during and after the earthquake on Monday, according to Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Agency.  There are a total of 19,574 rescue personnel working in the earthquake region for recovery efforts, an AFAD statement said.  Turkish Airlines announced Monday that flight operations to Adana, Elazig, and Diyarbakir continue for citizens who want to reach the earthquake zone. According to Afad's statement, the airports in Malatya, Adana, Diyarbakır, and Adıyaman are open to all flights. Gaziantep and Şanlıurfa Airports are only open to aid flights while Kahramanmaraş and Hatay airports are closed to flights due to the earthquake damage, an AFAD statement said.  The death toll in Turkey climbed to 2,316 on Monday, according to Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Agency (AFAD).  The European Union has activated its crisis response mechanism in order to coordinate the bloc’s support measures to Turkey and Syria quicker after devastating earthquakes on Monday.  “The Swedish presidency has decided on 6 February 2023 to activate the integrated political crisis response (IPCR) to coordinate EU support measures in response to the earthquake in Türkiye and Syria, in close collaboration with the European Commission,” the EU Council said in a statement.  The IPCR arrangements strengthen the EU's ability to take rapid decisions when facing major cross-sectoral crises requiring a response at EU level, it said.  Through this mechanism, the presidency of the Council coordinates the political response to the crisis by bringing together EU institutions, member states and other key actors, the EU Council added.  At least 77 aftershocks measuring 4.0 or greater have occurred since a magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck southern Turkey Monday morning local time, according to the United States Geological Survey. Three of the aftershocks have measured 6.0 or greater, including a magnitude 7.5 earthquake that struck 95 kilometers (59 miles) north of the epicenter of the main quake. The aftershocks stretch for more than 300 kilometers (185 miles) along the fault zone that ruptured in southern Turkey, oriented from southwest to northeast and stretching from the border with Syria up through the province of Malatya.   Conditions in northwest Syria are “terrifying” in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake on Monday, according to eyewitnesses.  The quake left “entire families dead” and “survivors sleeping on the streets in the freezing cold,” they told CNN. Dr. Mostafa Edo, a Country Director for the US-based NGO MedGlobal – who has lived in Idlib for the past three years – spent Monday distributing aid to hospitals across Syria’s northwest region.  He said what made this earthquake particularly terrifying was how long it lasted. “In the building where I live [in Idlib], my neighbor lives with his parents, both of whom have a disability. He couldn’t leave home during the earthquake because he had to stay by their side because they couldn’t leave home. They had to stay in place for hours that were absolutely horrific as the earthquake and aftershocks took place,” Edo said.  He added, “One of my colleagues, who I’ve worked with for more than five years, was killed about two years ago in Russian airstrikes. I found out today that his whole family, his wife and kids, all passed away today when their building collapsed.”  Limited resources to treat wounded: Edo said many hospitals in the area are not prepared for emergencies like this, and that his team distributed supplies to hospitals receiving the largest number of patients. There is still a high demand for supplies like orthopedic plates used to treat fractures, but that he and his team couldn’t find enough to meet that demand. “Hospitals right now are starting to suffer from electricity outages. A great number of hospitals, which were relying on electricity supplies from Turkey over the years, will now have to start depending on generators, which require diesel,” Edo said, adding that cities he traveled to on Monday including Harem, Darkush, Kafr Takharim and Tal Mileh, have been “particularly difficult” because paramedics are unable to use heavy machinery to help with rescue operations “due to fears that people are still alive under the rubble of buildings that have totally collapsed.” Khalil Ashawi, a photojournalist based in Jindayris in Syria’s northwest, said that in his 10 years of covering the war in Syria, he hasn’t witnessed scenes as disastrous as the ones he witnessed Monday. “It’s a disaster. Paramedics and firefighters are trying to help, but unfortunately, there is too much for them to deal with. They can’t handle it all,"" Ashawi said. “Entire families have been killed. Seven to eight people from the same family, all gone. These are the sort of situations I am seeing and hearing about today,” he said.  “It is freezing at the moment, and there are so many people sleeping in the streets right now because they have no homes to go to,” Ashawi added. Ashawi’s family is based in Turkey. He says his mom and dad, who live in Antakya, have been missing since Monday morning.  More than 2,700 people have been killed and thousands more injured after a powerful magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck Turkey and Syria early Monday. Officials continue to update the death toll as rescue efforts continue.  ##Syria## Palestinian civil defense and medical teams will be sent to Turkey and Syria to help in rescue operations following the deadly earthquake that rocked the region, the Palestinian Authority's Prime Minister, Muhammad Shtayyeh, said in a statement on Monday. ""The necessary arrangements have been made for the arrival of rescue teams with the Syrian and Turkish countries to facilitate access to the affected areas and provide assistance to the earthquake victims,"" Shtayyeh said. ##Turkey## ##Syria## After Turkey and Syria experienced the 7.8 magnitude earthquake, US Geological Survey recorded more than 60 aftershocks, including a major one at 7.5 magnitude. Remember: All aftershocks are individual earthquakes, but as long as they are not stronger that the original, main quake, they are considered aftershocks. Here's where these aftershocks struck: ##Turkey## ##Syria## President Joe Biden will speak with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan “very soon,” the White House said Monday, as Turkey reels from a devastating earthquake that left thousands dead and at least 14,000 people injured.  “We anticipate the president and President Erdogan will have an opportunity to speak very soon and we will certainly have a readout when that conversation occurs,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters at an afternoon press briefing.   The two leaders last spoke in person at the G20 summit in November. The death toll across Turkey and Syria has risen to at least 2,724 after a powerful 7.8 magnitude earthquake rocked Turkey and Syria early Monday.  The total number of injured climbed to 13,580, based on information provided by various agencies. Turkey has at least 11,119 injured people and Syria has 2,461 injured people following the quake. The total death toll in Syria rose to 1,073. News agency SANA reports 593 across government-controlled areas and the ""White Helmets"" group, officially known as the Syria Civil Defense, reported 480 deaths in opposition-controlled areas. The total death toll in Turkey has climbed to 1,651, according to Turkey's Vice President Fuat Oktay.  ##Turkey## ##Syria##  This is CNN journalist Eyad Kourdi's first-hand account of experiencing the 7.8 magnitude earthquake in Gaziantep, Turkey: It was just after 4:15 a.m. and my parents woke up in terror, screaming as the ground shook underneath us. I shouted at them to take cover. “It’s going to be over soon, it’s going to be over soon,” I yelled, even as it felt like it would never end. I wasn’t too worried at first. It’s just another minor earthquake, the kind we feel every couple of months around here, I thought. But just a few seconds later, it became so shaky that furniture was falling over and I could hear objects smashing. The force felt like somebody trying to knock me over, I could feel the violent reverberations in my chest. I fell to the ground. The shaking kept going. It was minutes before it finally stopped. We ran out of the house, in our pajamas and slippers. It was freezing cold and pouring down with rain. There was snow on the ground. The whole neighborhood was in the streets. Twenty minutes in, just as we thought it may be over, the first aftershocks came. I counted 11, one after another. I rushed back inside to grab some coats and proper boots and we jumped into a car to move into an open area, away from the buildings. I heard ambulances and fire trucks heading into the old town, which is full of older, more fragile structures. The aftershocks kept coming during the day. Some were unbelievably strong. One struck when I was right next to a badly damaged large building. A civil defense official shouted at everybody to run. Later, I drove to Pazarcık, a town of 35,000 people that’s closer to the epicenter. It felt like Armageddon. There’s at least one completely destroyed building in every single street. I stayed in Pazarcık for 30 minutes and, in that short time, I felt four aftershocks. It didn’t seem safe to stay, so I drove back to Gaziantep. That’s when the ground started trembling again. It felt biblical. Everybody ran out of their cars. The shaking was so strong that I was barely able to stay on my feet. The water in the ditch next to the road was violently thrashing back and forth like in a storm. In Gaziantep, we are sheltering inside a mosque where it’s safer than in our house. Municipal workers have been distributing water, bread and warm rice. I know it would be even safer to stay outside, in case there are more aftershocks. But the temperature is just above freezing. My parents can’t stay in the open. Eyad Kourdi reported from Gaziantep and Ivana Kottasova wrote from London. ##Turkey## Several archeological sites in Syria were damaged following the powerful earthquake that shook the region on Monday morning, according to Syria's Directorate-General for Antiquities and Museums (DGAM). The 13th century Aleppo Citadel ""suffered minor and moderate damage in which parts of the Ottoman mill fell, [there is] cracking and falling of parts of the northeast defensive fences. Large parts of the dome of the lighthouse of the Ayubi Mosque also fell, the entrances to the castle were damaged, and parts of the stone, including the entrance of the royal defense tower, and the front of the Ottoman refuge were damaged"", DGAM said in a Facebook post. Syria’s once-storied, ancient city of Aleppo in the country’s northwest was seriously damaged in the ongoing civil war, but reopened in 2018 after reconstruction work  DGAM says that artifacts inside the National Museum in Aleppo were damaged in Monday’s earthquake. DGAM also reports damage to historical buildings and mosques in the Hama Governorate in western-central Syria, such as cracks in the structure and collapsed walls in the Imam Ismail Mosque and the Shmemis Castle. The Al-Marqab Castle, a Crusader fortress near Baniyas, in Northwest Syria, also suffered damage, including the collapse of a block from one of its circular towers. ""The tremor also led to the fall of the rock cliff in the vicinity of the Qadous Castle and the collapse of some residential buildings situated in the castle's campus,"" DGAM said. Experts are still studying the full extent of the damage to the historical sites and surrounding historical buildings and neighborhoods. DGAM says it has not received ""accurate information"" about damage in the city of Homs.  The death toll across Turkey and Syria has risen to at least 2,701 after a powerful 7.8 magnitude earthquake rocked southern Turkey early Monday.  The total number of injured in Turkey and Syria climbed to 13,572 on Monday.  The total death toll in Syria rose to 1,050. New agency SANA reports 570 deaths across government-controlled areas and the ""White Helmets"" group, officially known as the Syria Civil Defense, reported 480 deaths in opposition-controlled areas. The total death toll in Turkey has climbed to 1,651, according to Turkey's Vice President Fuat Oktay. There are now 9,733 people injured in Turkey, Oktay also said.  At least 11,119 people have been injured in Turkey and 2,453 have been injured in Syria  following the earthquake. ##Syria## ##Turkey## Ten units of the Russian army with a total of more than 300 soldiers are involved in clearing debris and helping in search and rescue operations in Syria following devastating earthquake and aftershocks in the country, the Russian defense ministry said in a statement on Monday.   Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu “instructed the commander of the Russian (forces) in Syria to provide assistance,"" according to the statement.  The ministry said that Russian soldiers are mainly assisting in the cities of Aleppo, Hama and Latakia.  The servicemen are clearing debris, searching for victims and providing them with medical assistance, the statement said.  Earlier on Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin pledged assistance to Turkey and Syria in the aftermath of the deadly earthquake.  Some background: Russia is the strongest foreign power operating in Syria, and Putin has long allied himself with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, throwing the full weight of the Russian military behind the Syrian Army.  ##Syria##  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan declared seven days of national mourning due to the earthquake. Erdogan wrote in his tweet, ""Due to the earthquakes that took place in our country on February 6, 2023, a national mourning period was declared for seven days. Our flag will fly at half-mast until sunset on Sunday, February 12, 2023, all over our country and within the foreign representations."" ##Turkey## In addition to US personnel on the ground, the US is “in the process of deploying additional teams, including two 79-person urban search and rescue teams to support Turkish search and rescue efforts,"" National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby said. The United States Agency for International Development and the Pentagon are “now coordinating” with their Turkish counterparts on assistance. “This is a very fluid situation – things are moving, conversations are happening,” Kirby added. Turkish Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said the death toll climbed to 1,651 in southern Turkey after the devastating earthquake on Monday.  Koca also said 11,199 people were injured across 10 provinces of Turkey. ##Turkey## Dr. Mazen Kewara, the Turkey director for the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS), spoke to CNN from his car after he and his family took refuge in it and described the “horrible” earthquake that hit Turkey and Syria. “I am talking with you from my car,"" Kewara told CNN’s Becky Anderson. He said he’d been in his vehicle since 5 a.m. local time, more than 14 hours, with his family, including his kids. The earthquake was “something horrible,"" he added. “This is our first time to experience such a thing. And the weather condition is very difficult.” SAMS is an NGO that provides medical care to help Syrians on the frontlines of war or in this case natural disaster, and Kewara runs the operation that serves northwest Syria from its base in Gaziantep in southern Turkey. Kewara, who is Syrian, also said that after 11 years serving Syrians, “This is our first time to see ourselves directly with the victims.”  Kewara continued: “Previously we were responding to them and supporting them from our central office in Gaziantep. Today, we are victims like them. Directly we experience the same earthquake, horrible earthquake. But fortunately, we have vehicles. We can stay in our vehicles. But the people in northwest Syria, 4.5 million are IDPs (internally displaced persons) coming from different areas because of the 11-year war in Syria.” He went on to say that because of the “very very poor infrastructure,"" “everything is run by NGOs” in northwest Syria.  Mazen also drew a clear distinction between Turkey’s capabilities in dealing with the earthquake, versus the situation in northwest Syria.   “Things that the Turkish government can do for its people, the people of northwest Syria lack,"" he told CNN.  He also said that SAMS alone had dealt with 180 earthquake deaths and 800 casualties.  ##Turkey## ##Syria## The death toll across Turkey and Syria has risen to at least 2,509 following a powerful 7.8 magnitude earthquake with its epicenter in southern Turkey early Monday.  The total number of injured in Turkey and Syria climbed to 12,136 on Monday.  The total death toll in Syria rose to 968. Syria’s state-run news agency SANA reported 538 across government-controlled areas and the ""White Helmets"" group, officially known as the Syria Civil Defense, reported 430 deaths in opposition-controlled areas. The total death toll in Turkey has climbed to 1,541, according to Turkey's Vice President Fuat Oktay. There are now 9,733 people injured in Turkey, Oktay also said.  Turkey has at least 9,733 and Syria has 2,403 injured people following the devastating earthquake. ##Turkey## ##Syria## At least 54 aftershocks measuring 4.3 or greater have occurred since the 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck southern Turkey on Monday morning local time, according to the United States Geological Survey, which is a scientific agency of the US government. Three of the aftershocks have measured 6.0 or greater, including the massive 7.5 magnitude earthquake that struck 95 kilometers (about 59 miles) north of the epicenter of the morning’s main quake.  The aftershocks stretch for more than 300 kilometers (186 miles) along the fault zone that ruptured in southern Turkey, oriented from southwest to northeast and stretching from the border with Syria up through the province of Malatya. ##Turkey## A White Helmets volunteer working through the devastation in Syria says the organization does not have enough to handle this disaster. ""Our teams are working around the clock to help to save the injured people. But our capabilities, our powers are not enough to handle this disaster. This disaster is bigger than any organization in northwest Syria,"" Ismail Alabdullah told CNN. ""This disaster needs international efforts to handle."" The winter is making the situation worse for people who already suffer under the lack of basic necessities, Alabdullah said.  ""Most of them were displaced from other parts of Syria during the last 12 years of bombing and killing,"" he said, adding that any help they receive will be spent on saving people ""from under the rubble."" Many Syrians have been displaced as many as 20 times, according to International Rescue Committee's Mark Kaye, who spoke to CNN earlier Monday. Before daylight, Alabdullah said the team on ground thought it could handle the impact, which it assumed would be limited to a few sites. However, when daylight revealed the large scale of devastation, he said, ""we were shocked."" ""What do we need most right now is for us as rescue workers is heavy equipment that helps us in removing mountains of rubble,"" he told CNN. ""We need medical supplies for those who we saved from under the rubble. All of this is the urgent need for us. Alabdullah said he hopes that countries ""believe in human values and human rights"" and send support to Syria. ""We don't want to see that people stay under the rubble for weeks or days. We need immediate response from everyone, so we can help and end this disaster ... We don't want to see [more] people dying more,"" he added. ##Syria## Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said he spoke to Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Monday and offered to provide “all further assistance necessary"" following devastating earthquakes.  “I just spoke to President @RTErdogan. On behalf of the Greek people, I extended my deepest condolences for the devastating loss of life and reiterated our readiness to provide all further assistance necessary,” the prime minister said in a tweet.   ##Turkey## More than 2,300 people have died and thousands more are hurt after a massive earthquake rocked Turkey and Syria Monday morning. The magnitude 7.8 quake was one of the strongest to strike the area in more than a century. Amid severe aftershocks, Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Agency (AFAD) called for international help. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) says it is “launching immediate cash assistance” from its Disaster Response Emergency Fund to help relief efforts in both countries. Many other organizations are also on the ground responding. CNN’s Impact Your World has gathered ways to help victims of the massive earthquake.  You can read more about how you can help here. ##Turkey## ##Syria## Russian President Vladimir Putin held separate calls with his Turkish and Syrian counterparts, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Bashar al-Assad, on Monday and pledged Moscow's assistance in the aftermath of devastating earthquakes, according to a Kremlin readout.  Putin expressed “deep condolences over the devastating earthquakes” to Erdogan and “reaffirmed his readiness to immediately provide the Turkish partners with the necessary assistance in eliminating the consequences of this natural disaster,” the readout said. According to the Russian readout, Erdogan “warmly thanked” Putin and said that he was instructing the competent departments of the country to accept the help of Russian rescuers.  In a conversation with Assad, Putin also conveyed his condolences and “offered to provide the Syrian side with the necessary assistance in eliminating the consequences of this disaster” which Assad accepted, according to the Kremlin.   “Bashar al-Assad accepted this offer with gratitude, and in the next few hours, rescuers from the Russian Emergencies Ministry will fly to Syria,” the Kremlin readout went on to say.  Some background: Russia is the strongest foreign power operating in Syria, and Putin has long allied himself with Assad, throwing the full weight of the Russian military behind the Syrian Army. ##Syria## ##Turkey## The region of northwest Syria, which was impacted by the deadly earthquake on Monday, has 4.1 million people who rely on humanitarian assistance, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) on Monday. The majority of these people are women and children and along with the devastation from the earthquake, Syrian communities are battling an ongoing cholera outbreak amid a harsh winter with heavy rain and snow over the weekend, OCHA said in its statement. “The UN and partners are monitoring the situation on the ground amidst information flow constraints due to chronic telecommunication disruptions and power shortages. Infrastructural damages are difficult to assess at this time and roads have been reportedly blocked in both Türkiye and north-west Syria,” OCHA added. At least 820 people are reported dead in Syria following the 7.8 magnitude earthquake on Monday. The Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) reports 430 deaths across government-controlled areas and the ""White Helmets"" group, officially known as the Syria Civil Defense, reported 390 deaths in opposition-controlled areas. Here are some visuals from the ground: ##Syria## A CNN producer said that the aftershocks of Monday’s powerful earthquake in Turkey were “like Armageddon.” “I actually don’t believe I made it out,"" said Eyad Kourdi, who was in Gaziantep when the initial earthquake struck. When the tremors began, Kourdi said his parents screamed and that he did his best to calm them down, assuring them it would be over soon.  The situation was ""even more catastrophic"" in the neighboring town of Pazarcik, where Kourdi visited, adding that as he was leaving he witnessed people running out of dozens of cars during a major aftershock, which measured 7.5 in magnitude. While returning to Gaziantep, Kourdi reported seeing five kilometers (more than three miles) of traffic as people queued to evacuate the city. ##Turkey## The death toll across Turkey and Syria has risen to at least 2,361 after a powerful 7.8 magnitude earthquake rocked southern Turkey early Monday. The total death toll in Turkey has climbed to 1,541, according to Turkey's Vice President Fuat Oktay. There are now 9,733 people injured in Turkey, Oktay also said.  The total death toll in Syria is 820. The Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) reports 430 deaths across government-controlled areas and the ""White Helmets"" group, officially known as the Syria Civil Defense, reported 390 deaths in opposition-controlled areas. ##Syria## ##Turkey## Spain and France each announced Monday they will send rescue workers to Turkey to assist in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake. A total of 139 French civil security rescue workers will fly to Turkey on Monday evening to assist with search and rescue efforts, France’s Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said.  In a tweet, Darmanin said the response came “at the request of the president of the republic,” and is “part of the European solidarity mechanism.”  “France stands in full solidarity with Turkey in these terrible circumstances,” the minister added. Spain will send a group of 85 specialists to Turkey on Monday to support search and rescue operations, the country's interior ministry said in a statement.   One team, with 50 members from the defense ministry's military emergencies unit, will leave from the Moron air force base in southern Spain, according to the ministry. A second team, with 35 members from the Madrid regional government's emergency response unit, will leave on a flight from the Torrejon air force base near Madrid.   The European Union mechanism for civil protection has confirmed Turkey's acceptance of this aid from Spain, the ministry added.   An Israeli security source told CNN that Syria asked Russia to convey a request for earthquake aid to Israel, but a Syrian source denied this claim. A request of that kind would be extraordinary: Israel and Syria are formally at war and have no diplomatic relations. An Israeli diplomatic source said he was not aware of any previous request for aid from a country it was formally at war with.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had announced earlier on Monday that he had approved a request from “a diplomatic element” for aid to Syria, and that he assumed it would be acted on “in the near future.”  An unnamed Syrian official source then categorically denied there had been such a request, telling a pro-government media outlet Al-Watan, “It is disgraceful that Netanyahu exploits the catastrophe of the earthquake that struck Syria to mislead public opinion and cover up the expansionist and aggressive policies of the occupation.” Israel regularly sends search and rescue teams around the world in the wake of disasters. Israel formally offered aid to Lebanon in the wake of the devastating Beirut port explosion of 2020, but Lebanon – also officially at war with Israel – did not accept. ##Syria## US President Joe Biden has “authorized an immediate U.S. response” in the aftermath of a powerful magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck Turkey and Syria overnight.  “Jill and I were deeply saddened by the news of the devastating earthquakes that have thus far claimed thousands of lives in Turkiye and Syria. My Administration has been working closely with our NATO Ally Turkiye, and I authorized an immediate U.S. response,” Biden said in a statement Monday morning as CNN is learning that more than 2,000 people have been killed and rescue and recovery efforts continue. Senior US officials, he said, are coordinating their Turkish counterparts on assistance needs. “Our teams are deploying quickly to begin to support Turkish search and rescue efforts and address the needs of those injured and displaced by the earthquake,” Biden said.  He added that “U.S.-supported humanitarian partners are also responding to the destruction in Syria.” The President expressed condolences to those impacted by the earthquake. Qatar and Kuwait will set up an air bridge for the flow of humanitarian aid into Turkey. Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani said Qatar’s International Search and Rescue Group (QSART) will fly to Turkey through the air bridge as soon as Monday, carrying with them specialized rescue and search vehicles, and relief aid, tents and winter supplies to set up field hospitals upon arrival, Qatar News Agency (QNA) said.  Kuwait’s Emir Sheikh Nawaf Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah also ordered the establishment of the air bridge to send “urgent aid and medical staff,” Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) said in a statement. ##Turkey##   The 7.8 magnitude earthquake that hit Turkey and Syria on Monday has led to a “catastrophic situation” in Syria, an official of the International Rescue Committee (IRC) told CNN. “What we are seeing inside Syria really is a catastrophic situation,” said Mark Kaye, IRC's policy, advocacy and communications director for Middle East and North Africa. The earthquake has made the situation worse for the already vulnerable and displaced populations in Syria, specifically the rural areas, Kaye said. “For this area, you have to remember: This population [was] already highly vulnerable. They have a huge amount of people who have already been displaced — sometimes as many as 20 times ... Almost the majority of them are women and children, particularly vulnerable to the harsh weather and this earthquake,” Kaye said. Displaced people living in makeshift camps are facing freezing winds and the camps are not equipped to withstand an earthquake of this intensity, he added. “So today you will be seeing a lot of people being pulled out from the rubble. I think what we are really concerned about as well is those who have survived ... whether the health system is going to be able to really come to grip with that and not be completely overburdened,” Kaye told CNN. Power cuts and a lack of communication across northern Syria have made search operations difficult, particularly in rural areas where the infrastructure is not built to withstand such a powerful earthquake, he explained. He commended countries’ offers to send help to Turkey but said those commitments should translate to Syria as well, expressing concern that the ""search and rescue operation really isn’t fit"" for addressing the large numbers of people that may be affected. ##Syria## The UN is ready to support emergency response efforts following the deadly earthquake in Turkey and Syria, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres tweeted on Monday. “I am deeply saddened by the news of the devastating earthquakes in Türkiye & Syria, and offer my heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims,” he wrote. Rescuers are now searching for survivors after the powerful magnitude 7.8 earthquake shook the region, leaving more than 2,000 people dead and thousands more injured. More than a dozen provinces in eastern Turkey are under yellow and orange weather warnings through Tuesday, which are Level 1 and 2 out of 3, according to the Turkish State Meteorological Services website.  These weather warnings have been issued due to snowy and windy conditions including the provinces of Osmaniye, Kahramanmaras, Adiyaman, and Malatya, which have been experiencing several aftershocks over the last 12 hours. Gaziantep, where the original 7.8 magnitude earthquake occurred, is not included under any weather warnings, however, scattered rain showers and potential snow flurries are possible through Tuesday morning local time. Temperatures are currently running around 5 to 8 degrees Celsius below average across the region. Low temperatures near the main earthquake’s epicenter are forecast to drop over the next couple of days. By Tuesday morning, temperatures will hover around the freezing mark but by Wednesday and Thursday morning temperatures will be several degrees below zero.  ##Turkey## While Turkey and Syria are reeling from the aftermath of the powerful 7.8 magnitude earthquake, the impact was felt as far as Lebanon and Israel. Take a look: At least 1,498 people have died and 8,533 people were injured in Turkey after the devastating earthquake ripped through Turkey and Syria, according to Yunus Sezer, the head of Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Agency (AFAD). There are 15,000 rescue personnel working in the region, and due to the bad weather, they are using helicopters and planes to reach the earthquake locations, Sezer said. At least 2,834 buildings were damaged, and authorities are working on providing shelter for the citizens for the night, the official added.  ##Turkey## US Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed “deep sadness at the tragic loss of life and destruction” in Turkey and Syria due to the earthquake.  “We extend our condolences to the families of those affected and are assessing our comprehensive response options. I have directed my team to remain in close contact with our Turkish allies and our humanitarian partners in the coming days to determine what the region needs,” Blinken said in a statement Monday.  He noted that an ""initial response"" from the US is already underway, and committed to providing assistance ""in the days, weeks, and months ahead."" At least 120 aftershocks have occurred following Monday’s powerful earthquake in southern Turkey, according to an update from Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Agency (AFAD). Remember: All aftershocks are individual earthquakes. But as long as they are not stronger than the original, main quake, they are considered aftershocks.  Separately, the United States Geological Survey (USGS), which only reports the more significant aftershocks that are actually felt by those in the earthquake zone, reported at least 43 aftershocks of 4.3 or greater magnitude. Three of the aftershocks measured 6.0 or greater, including the massive 7.5 magnitude earthquake that struck 95 kilometers (59 miles) north of the epicenter of the morning’s main quake, according to USGS. The aftershocks stretch for more than 300 kilometers (about 186 miles) along the fault zone that ruptured in southern Turkey — oriented from southwest to northeast and stretching from the border with Syria up through the province of Malatya.  ##Turkey## Turkey has sent a formal request to NATO and allies for assistance in dealing with the aftermath of Monday's earthquake. The country has requested medical assistance and equipment, various urban search and rescue units as well as ""extreme weather-proof fully equipped field hospitals with technical personnel for assembly."" The response is being coordinated by NATO's Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination Centre, which is based at NATO headquarters in Brussels. ##Turkey## The death toll across Turkey and Syria has risen to at least 2,318 after a powerful 7.8 magnitude earthquake rocked southern Turkey early Monday.

Our club wants to express its condolences and affection for the family members of the victims. Likewise, we wish for the quick recovery of the injured."" German giants Bayern Munich too sent a message of condolence Thursday saying, ""FC Bayern München is sending out prayers to the earthquake victims and their loved ones,"" while the French club Paris Saint-Germain said: “Following the severe earthquake that occurred overnight in Kahramanmaras that has caused a number of deaths, Paris Saint-Germain would like to show its support for the people of Turkey, as well as all the players, coaches and staff in the Red-and-Blue family and their loved ones.” Iconic English soccer club Liverpool also posted on social media saying: “Our thoughts are with all those who are affected by the devastating earthquake in Turkey and Syria,” and reigning Serie A champs AC Milan said the Italian club ""offers its deepest sympathies to all those affected by the earthquakes that have struck Turkey and Syria.

Mammoth aftershock: A major aftershock measuring 7.5 in magnitude hit Turkey at 1:24 p.m. local time (5:24 a.m. ET), according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS). It is the largest of the more than 30 aftershocks to strike so far. 
Refugees impacted: Hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees, displaced by the civil war in their home country, are settled in the regions of Turkey that have been worst hit. 
World leaders offer aid: Azerbaijan will send a search and rescue team of 370 people and aid material to Turkey, while the Netherlands said it will send 15 metric tons of search and rescue equipment. German technical aid agency THW also said is preparing to deploy aid to the region. 
Challenging weather conditions: With a cold and wet weather system moving through the region, poor conditions are likely to impact the post-quake rescue and recovery efforts in southern Turkey and northern Syria on Monday, according to CNN meteorologists.  ##Catch Up## Dr. Mazen Kewara, Turkey director of the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS), spoke live on CNN from near the earthquake’s epicenter in Gaziantep, where he and his family were taking shelter in their car. Kewara said that their car was the safest place for them to be at present. “We cannot use the buildings anymore. Maybe for hours. Maybe until tomorrow. I don’t know.” Turkey continues to be struck by aftershocks – some nearly as strong as the initial earthquake – meaning it is not safe to be inside. “Next to my building, about 200-300 meters away, there’s a collapsed building. There are many buildings that have collapsed in Gaziantep,” said Kewara. SAMS is a medical relief organization, working in Syria and neighboring countries. But their efforts to provide support will be hampered by the damage to buildings. “We have four of our hospitals damaged severely by the earthquake. We have evacuated two of them,” said Kewara, who is originally from Damascus, Syria. The ongoing aftershocks will make it “very, very, very challenging for us as a humanitarian organization to be able to respond” to those in need. For now, Kewara and five others remain sheltered in his car, waiting for the tremors to stop. ##Syria## Responding to reports of a 7.5 magnitude aftershock following the first quake in southern Turkey this morning, CNN’s meteorologist and severe weather expert Chad Myers explained why the aftershocks have been so severe. The 7.5 aftershock was “an earthquake in itself,” Myers told CNN's This Morning. “It would have been the strongest earthquake since 1999 in the region.” We always talk about the epicenter, but in this case we should talk about the epi-line. Two massive tectonic plates – the Arabian and the Eurasian – meet underneath Turkey’s southeastern provinces. Along this fault line, “about 100 miles from one side to the other, the earth slipped,” said Myers.  Seismologists refer to this event as a “strike slip” – “where the plates are touching, and all of a sudden they slide sideways,” said Myers. This is unlike the Ring of Fire, which runs along the west coast of the United States. In this zone, earthquakes and tsunamis are often caused by subduction – where one plate slides below another. But in a “strike slip,” the plates move horizontally, rather than vertically. “Why that matters is because the buildings don’t want to go back and forth. And then the secondary waves begin to go back and forth as well,” said Myers. Because of the nature of this seismic event, aftershocks could last ""for weeks and months,"" according to CNN meteorologist Karen Maginnis. The Netherlands will fly 15 metric tons (16.5 imperial tons) of search and rescue equipment to Turkey Monday, following the deadly 7.8 magnitude earthquake there. “It is expected that at the end of the afternoon, a cargo plane with 15 tons of heavy rescue equipment and other supplies will depart for Turkey from Eindhoven,” the Urban Search and Rescue Team said on its website. The departure time for 65 rescue workers and eight search dogs is still unknown, the organization said. Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra said earlier that the search and rescue team will include ""police and military personnel, first aid responders, and firefighters."" “Shocked by the news of the devastating earthquake in Türkiye and Syria. Our thoughts are with the victims, their families, and the many injured Turks and Syrians,"" Hoekstra added. A powerful earthquake rocked Turkey early Monday, killing more than 1,500 people and injuring thousands more across the country and neighboring Syria.  Photos showing the true scale of the disaster emerged as the day broke. Entire city blocks were flattened by the quake, metal rods were strewn across the streets and vehicles toppled over. Rescuers are still working to free people trapped under the rubble. ##Turkey## ##Syria## German technical aid agency THW is preparing to deploy aid to the region affected by Monday's deadly earthquake, which has killed at least 1,500 people and injured thousands more in Turkey and Syria. THW will deliver tents, blankets and emergency power generators, according to government spokesman Maximilian Kall.  After speaking with Turkish Ambassador to Berlin Ahmet Başar Şen, German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser vowed to send all the help needed, Kall said. Turkey has asked for a European Civil Protection Team to be deployed, he added. Meanwhile, NATO and the EU have offered to send help following the disaster, according to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. At least 1,504 people have been killed in Turkey and Syria, and thousands more injured, after a powerful 7.8 magnitude earthquake rocked southern Turkey early Monday. In Syria, a total of at least 592 people have died, including 371 mostly in the regions of Aleppo, Hama, Latakia and Tartus, according to Syrian state news agency SANA, which also reported 1,089 injuries. Meanwhile, the ""White Helmets"" group, officially known as the Syria Civil Defense, also reported at least 221 deaths and 419 injuries in opposition-controlled areas of northwestern Syria. “Hundreds remain trapped under rubble,” the White Helmets added on Twitter. In Turkey, at least 912 people have died and 5,385 people were injured, Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said in a televised address Monday. Rescuers are working through the rubble of collapsed buildings to locate survivors, while NATO, the EU and 45 countries have offered assistance following the disaster. A major aftershock measuring 7.5 in magnitude struck Turkey at 1:24 p.m. local time (5:24 a.m. ET), after a devastating 7.8 magnitude earthquake rocked the region early Monday.  The aftershock is located approximately 95 kilometers (60 miles) north of the original quake that struck a little over nine hours earlier in southern Turkey, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS). This is the largest of the more than 30 aftershocks to strike so far. This is a preliminary estimate on the earthquake magnitude and is subject to change. The 7.5 magnitude earthquake is considered an aftershock of the earlier 7.8 magnitude quake. All aftershocks are individual earthquakes, but as long as they are not stronger that the original, main quake, they are considered aftershocks. This aftershock was extremely shallow, only 10 km deep, which worsens the shaking felt. The main quake was 17.9 km deep. Before this morning’s 7.8, the 7.5 magnitude earthquake would have been the most powerful to strike Turkey since the 1999 Izmit quake that killed at least 17,000 people. More than 1,500 people have died across Turkey and Syria following Monday's quake, with thousands more injured in both countries. At least 1,388 people have died across Turkey and Syria, after a huge 7.8 magnitude earthquake swept across southern Turkey early Monday, injuring thousands more people in both countries. In Syria, at least 476 people have died, including 326 mostly in the regions of Aleppo, Hama, Latakia and Tartus, according to Syrian state news agency, which also reported at least 1,042 injuries. Out of those who lost their lives, at least 139 were in Latakia, its governor told Syrian state TV. Meanwhile, the ""White Helmets"" group, officially known as the Syria Civil Defense, also reported at least 150 deaths and 350 injuries in opposition-controlled areas of northwestern Syria. In Turkey, at least 912 people have died and 5,385 people were injured, Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said in a televised address Monday. A CNN eyewitness said aftershocks were still being felt hours after the earthquake. Photos have also emerged showing the disastrous aftermath of the quake, with entire buildings collapsed and cars toppled over.  Rescuers are working through the debris of fallen infrastructure to search for survivors, while the port of Iskenderun in southern Turkey and some airport runways have been damaged.  Earthquakes are measured using seismographs, which monitor the seismic waves that travel through the Earth after a quake. Scientists used the Richter Scale for many years but now largely follow the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale, which the US Geological Survey says is a more accurate measure of size. The Richter scale measures magnitude, whereas the MMI scale measures intensity. Here are the magnitude classes, according to the California Earthquake Authority: Magnitude and intensity conceptualize earthquakes differently. The California Institute of Technology explains: To scientists, an earthquake is an event inside the earth. To the rest of us, it is an extraordinary movement of the ground. Magnitude measures the former, while intensity measures the latter. A humanitarian organization in Syria has made a plea for urgent assistance from the international community. Speaking on CNN's This Morning show, Rahaf Aboud, head of communications at the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, called for “the support of the European Union, the United Nations, and the international community in response to the devastating earthquake that took place in Syria.” Aboud requested that these organizations “provide the necessary resources and support, including shelter, food, medical care, and other essential supplies.” “We hope that the UN will respond to this call for support to alleviate the suffering of those who have been impacted by this earthquake through cross-line intervention,” Aboud said, speaking live from Damascus, Syria. This morning, volunteers from the Syrian Arab Red Crescent are at affected sites in Hama, Aleppo and Lattakia, responding to people trapped in the buildings that collapsed as a result of the earthquake.  Hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees, displaced by the war in their home country, are settled in the regions of Turkey that have been worst hit by this morning’s earthquake. Turkey shelters more than 3.6 million Syrian refugees, according to data from Human Rights Watch.  Many of these refugees settled along the Turkish-Syrian border. The Hatay, Gaziantep and Sanliurfa provinces are each home to more than 300,000 Syrians, according to data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  Other neighboring provinces also shelter hundreds of thousands more refugees, who have fled their home country since the beginning of the Syrian civil war in 2011. The Turkish government has received offers of assistance from the the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the European Union and 45 countries following the devastating earthquake that struck southern Turkey early Monday. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan announced the news in a televised address Monday, adding that at least 912 people have died in the country following the 7.8 magnitude quake. Another 5,385 people have been injured and more than 2,400 people rescued from under the rubble of collapsed buildings. The Turkish leader said there has been ""heavy destruction"" in cities, with around 2,818 buildings destroyed.  ""We hope that we will overcome this disaster together as soon as possible,"" Erdogan added.  In neighboring Syria, at least 386 people have died, including 239 mostly in the regions of Aleppo, Hama, Latakia and Tartus, Syrian state TV reported earlier. The ""White Helmets"" group, officially known as the Syria Civil Defense, also reported at least 147 deaths in opposition-controlled areas of northwestern Syria. Hundreds more have been reported injured in Syria.  CNN's Kareem El Damanhoury contributed reporting. More than 1,200 people have died in Turkey and Syria after a powerful 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit Turkey early Monday, injuring thousands more across both countries. At least 912 people have died in Turkey, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said in a televised address Monday.  In Syria, at least 386 people have died, including 239 mostly in the regions of Aleppo, Hama, Latakia and Tartus, Syrian state TV reported earlier.

Another 340 injuries were also reported in opposition-controlled areas, White Helmets added.  Rescue teams in Turkey rescued over 2,400 people from under the rubble of buildings flattened by the quake, Erdogan said. In Turkey, around 9,000 personnel are working at the moment on search and rescue efforts with more people joining, the Turkish leader added. It is unknown how many more people are under the debris. The Turkish government's coordination center is in the capital Ankara and is being run by Vice President Fuat Oktay, Erdogan said. CNN's Kareem El Damanhoury contributed reporting. Soccer teams in Turkey united to send messages of solidarity in the wake of Monday's deadly earthquake. Istanbul giants Galatasaray wished a ""quick recovery to the injured."" ""May God show mercy to our citizens who lost their lives in the earthquake that occurred in Kahramanmaras and felt in the nearby cities. Our condolences to the families and to our nation and we wish quick recovery to the injured,"" the club tweeted Monday. Local city rivals Fenerbahce also took to social media to ""wish God’s mercy on our citizens who lost their lives and a speedy recovery to our injured citizens in Kahramanmaras."" Another Istanbul-based team, Besiktas, sent their ""best wishes"" to ""citizens who lost their lives in the earthquake felt in many cities, especially to Kahramanmaras, Hatay, Gaziantep, Adana, Osmaniye, Diyarbakir, Malatya and Sanliurfa."" Besiktas also called on people to donate blood to help those impacted by the earthquake The port of Iskenderun in southern Turkey was damaged after the fatal 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit the country early Monday, shaking buildings and toppling over vehicles.  Some parts of the port’s dock collapsed, Turkey’s directorate of maritime said on Twitter. Other ports in the country have not been damaged, the directorate added. Elsewhere, cracks formed on the runways of some airports in the earthquake zone, according to Turkey defense ministry.  Monday's quake is believed to be the strongest to hit Turkey since 1939, and has killed at least 670 people across Turkey and nearby Syria. Photos of the devastating disaster showed flattened infrastructure and metal rods strewn across the streets, as workers tried to clear the debris.  The epicenter of the earthquake was Kahramanmaraş in Turkey and 10 provinces were affected in total. Defense Minister Hulusi Akar said search and rescue teams are still needed in the affected areas. Military planes are working on sending teams to the affected zones and an air corridor has been established. A chorus of global leaders have sent messages of solidarity after a powerful 7.8 magnitude earthquake ripped through Turkey early Monday, killing at least 670 people across Turkey and neighboring Syria.  NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance is in ""full solidarity"" with Turkey. ""Full solidarity with our Ally #Türkiye in the aftermath of this terrible earthquake. I am in touch with President @RTErdogan and Foreign Minister @MevlutCavusoglu, and #NATO Allies are mobilizing support now,"" he said in a tweet Monday. European Union top diplomat Josep Borrell said the bloc is ""ready to help,"" after Monday's quake. ""Devastating earthquake rocked Türkiye and Syria this morning, claiming the lives of hundreds of people and injuring many more. Our thoughts are with the people of Türkiye and Syria. The EU is ready to help,"" Borrell said.  The President of the European Council Charles Michel sent his ""deepest condolences"" to the victims of the disaster.

Germany is ready to provide assistance to Turkey and Syria after a powerful earthquake rocked the region early Monday, its foreign minister said.  ""My thoughts are with the families of those who lost their lives in these terrible #earthquakes and those who still fear for their relatives, friends or neighbors,"" Annalena Baerbock wrote on Twitter. ""Together with our partners, we stand ready to provide assistance."" Global support: Leaders from the US, Israel, India, Pakistan and Ukraine are among countries to offer condolences and pledge support following the disaster. The Netherlands said it will send a search and rescue team to Turkey after the country's disaster agency asked the international community for help.  More than 500 people have been killed and some 3,000 others injured in Turkey and Syria after a magnitude 7.8 earthquake hit southern Turkey early Monday.  Rescuers are now frantically searching for survivors after the powerful quake shook the region, causing multiple aftershocks and sending tremors as far away as Lebanon and Israel. Here's what you need to know: Major disaster: The quake struck 23 kilometers (14.2 miles) east of Nurdagi in Turkey's Gaziantep province, at a depth of 24.1 kilometers (14.9 miles), and is one of the strongest to hit the region in more than 100 years, the US Geological Survey (USGS) said.
The victims: At least 284 people have died and more than 2,300 others were injured in Turkey, officials said. In neighboring Syria, at least 237 people died and 639 others were injured, state media reported, citing the Health Ministry. USGS estimated the total death toll could reach as high as 10,000 people.
Devastating aftermath: The Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS) said their hospitals in Syria ""are overwhelmed with patients filling the hallways,"" while the White Helmets, also known as the Syrian Civil Defense, declared the northwest of the country as a ""disaster area.""
Survivors' accounts: Journalist Eyad Kourdi, who lives in Gaziantep, told CNN there were up to eight ""very strong"" aftershocks in under a minute after the quake. Dr. Mazen Kewara, SAMS Middle East director, said he was sheltering in his car with his family ""in very very heavy weather"" after the quake. They were sleeping ""when we started to feel everything shaking around us,"" he said.
Rescue efforts: The Netherlands and Israel are among countries to pledge support after Turkey's disaster agency appealed for help from the international community. Meanwhile, nearly 1,000 search and rescue volunteers have been deployed from Istanbul to southern Turkey, officials said. 
Freezing conditions: Poor weather, including snow and sub-zero temperatures, is likely to hamper the rescue efforts as a cold and wet weather system moves through the region. Temperatures will drop Tuesday, with the low in Gaziantep expected to fall to -6 degrees Celsius (21 degrees Fahrenheit).
Global support: Leaders from the US, India, Pakistan and Ukraine have offered condolences and pledged support following the disaster. White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the US was ""profoundly concerned"" about the destruction. ##Catch Up## Turkey's centuries-old Gaziantep Castle has been heavily damaged after a powerful earthquake and aftershocks rocked the country's south on Monday morning.  ""Some of the bastions in the east, south and southeast parts of the historical Gaziantep Castle in the central Şahinbey district were destroyed by the earthquake, the debris was scattered on the road,"" Turkish state-run news agency Anadolu reported. 
""The iron railings around the castle were scattered on the surrounding sidewalks. The retaining wall next to the castle also collapsed. In some bastions, large cracks were observed.""  The dome and eastern wall of the historical Şirvani Mosque, which is located next to the castle and is said to have been built in the 17th century, also partially collapsed, it added.  According to archaeological excavations, the castle was first built as a watchtower in the Roman period in II-IV centuries A.D and expanded over time.  It took its current form in between 527-565 A.D. during the period of Byzantine Emperor Justinian I, according to Turkish Museums, the official site of museums and archaeological sites in the country.  CORRECTION: This post has been updated after an earlier version misidentified Gaziantep Castle's heritage status. The death toll from the powerful earthquake that hit southern Turkey early Monday could reach as high as 10,000 people, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) said. According to its estimates, USGS said there is a 47% chance of it reaching between 1,000 to 10,000 people, whereas there is a 27% chance of it reaching between 100 and 1,000 and a 20% chance of it reaching between 10,000 and 100,000.  The USGS estimates come from modeling based on historical earthquakes in the region, the population exposed to the heaviest shaking, and the vulnerability of the structures in the hardest hit zones. ""High casualties and extensive damage are probable and the disaster is likely widespread,"" the USGS said in the report.
""The population in this region resides in structures that are extremely vulnerable to earthquake shaking, though some resistant structures exist."" The report also estimates economic losses will likely be between $1 billion to $10 billion, which could reach up to 2% of Turkey’s GDP. So far, more than 500 people have been confirmed dead and some 3,000 others injured in Turkey and Syria, according to officials and state media. With a cold and wet weather system moving through the region, poor conditions are likely to impact the post-earthquake rescue and recovery efforts in southern Turkey and northern Syria on Monday, according to CNN meteorologists. Temperatures just above the freezing mark are occurring in Turkey's Gaziantep province, with rain and snow showers forecast on both Monday and Tuesday.  Even though early February falls within the coldest part of the year, the current temperatures are even colder than average, running about 5 degrees Celsius (about 9 degrees Fahrenheit) below seasonal norms. And the weather is about to get colder: Temperatures will drop below freezing by Tuesday, with the low in Gaziantep falling to -6 degrees Celsius (21 degrees Fahrenheit). Snow showers will become more widespread later on Monday and lasting through Tuesday. The snow will be heaviest in the higher elevations, but could fall all the way down to the border with Syria. Despite the conditions, officials have asked residents to leave their buildings their safety, as additional aftershocks are expected following Monday's 7.8 quake. However, ""that’s a pretty difficult ask considering that the weather at the time is right around freezing,"" CNN's Scott McLean reports. ""It’s very difficult to be outside in your pajamas for long periods of time without coats, without supplies.” The Netherlands will send a search and rescue team to Turkey to assist in the response to the earthquake that has left hundreds dead, Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra said on Monday. “This team includes police and military personnel, first aid responders, and firefighters,” Hoekstra said on Twitter. “Shocked by the news of the devastating earthquake in Türkiye and Syria. Our thoughts are with the victims, their families, and the many injured Turks and Syrians.” Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Agency (AFAD) earlier called on the international community for help with search and rescue efforts.  Messages of condolences and support poured in Monday as world leaders woke to the news of the deadly earthquake that struck Turkey and Syria. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky extended his condolences to the victims  on Twitter and offered assistance. ""We stand with the people of Turkey in this difficult time. We are ready to provide the necessary assistance to overcome the consequences of the disaster,"" Zelensky said.
On Twitter, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was ""Anguished by the loss of lives and damage of property"" from the quake. ""India stands in solidarity with the people of Turkey and is ready to offer all possible assistance to cope with this tragedy,"" he said.  
Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif sent his condolences to the people of both Turkey and Syria in a series of tweets. The total death toll across the two countries following the earthquake stands at more than 500. 
Israel's President Isaac Herzog tweeted: ""The State of Israel always stands ready to assist in every way possible. Our hearts are with the grieving families and the Turkish people at this painful moment.""
White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the United States was “profoundly concerned” about the destruction in Syria and Turkey. “I have been in touch with Turkish officials to relay that we stand ready to provide any & all needed assistance. We will continue to closely monitor the situation in coordination with Turkiye,” Sullivan wrote on Twitter.
The US diplomatic mission in Turkey also expressed “deep sorrow for the tragic casualties and extensive damage caused by the earthquake” in a tweet. More than 500 people have been killed in two countries after a powerful 7.8 magnitude earthquake rocked southern Turkey early Monday.  At least 284 people have died and more than 2,300 were injured in Turkey, according to the country's Vice President Fuat Oktay.  In Syria, at least 237 people were killed and 639 injured, Syrian state-run news agency SANA reported, citing a Health Ministry official.  The total death toll across Turkey and Syria is now at least 521.  The quake is one of the strongest to hit Turkey in more than 100 years and sent tremors across the region, collapsing buildings and sending residents running into the streets. More than 1,700 buildings were damaged across 10 Turkish cities, the Turkish vice president said.  The Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS) said its hospitals in Syria ""are overwhelmed with patients filling the hallways"" following the powerful earthquake that struck Monday.  ""There is an immediate need for trauma supplies and a comprehensive emergency response,"" the relief organization said in a statement. 
""Many hospitals are full, but some critical facilities, including Al Dana Hospital had to evacuate patients after sustaining severe damage from the earthquake. Likewise, the Idleb Maternity Hospital was forced to transfer all newborns to a nearby hospital."" SAMS’ president Dr. Amjad Rass said the organization has been receiving victims and working to guarantee the wellbeing of more than 1,700 staff in Syria and 90 in Gaziantep, Turkey.  The death toll across Turkey and Syria stands at more than 300, with nearly 2,000 reported injured after the magnitude 7.8 earthquake hit southern Turkey. Aleast 18 aftershocks with a magnitude over 4 have been recorded after a powerful earthquake struck southern Turkey early Monday, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS). USGS said it recorded seven quakes with a magnitude above 5.  The strongest aftershock so far was recorded only 11 minutes after the first quake and had a magnitude of 6.7, USGS said.   Experts say strong aftershocks are likely to continue in the hours and even days to come after an earthquake as strong as the one Turkey experienced Monday morning. Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Galant said the country is preparing to provide emergency aid to Turkey after it experienced one of the most powerful earthquakes in more than 100 years.  ""The security forces are ready to offer whatever assistance is required. The security system has gained a lot of experience over the years in dealing with disaster areas and in the mission of saving lives,"" Galant said in a statement.  In another statement, Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen expressed ""deep sorrow"" to the Turkish people.  ""On behalf of the State of Israel, I would like to express deep sorrow to the Turkish people for the severe earthquake that struck southern Turkey tonight,"" Cohen said.
""Our hearts go out to the victims and we wish the injured a speedy recovery. I instructed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to lead a rapid aid program for Turkey to deal with the severe disaster.""  There have been no reports of injuries or damage so far in Israel, though shaking from the 7.8 magnitude quake could be felt in the country.  At least 237 people have died and 639 others were injured after a powerful earthquake hit southern Turkey early Monday, Syrian state news agency SANA reported, citing a Ministry of Health official.  The official death toll across Turkey and Syria now stands at more than 300, with nearly 2,000 injured. The Syrian Ministry of Defense said in a statement it is ""mobilizing all its units, formations and institutions in all governorates to provide immediate aid and urgent assistance to the residents affected by the earthquake, search for people trapped under the rubble, and to treat the injured."" Shaking from the quake, one of the most powerful to hit the region in more than 100 years, could be felt up as far away as Israel. Shaking from the deadly powerful earthquake that hit southern Turkey could be felt up as far away as Israel. People in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv reported feeling the shaking early Monday morning and Israeli police said they had received more than 3,000 such reports.  There have been no reports of injuries or damage so far in Israel.  Nearly 200 people have been killed and about 1,000 others injured in Turkey and Syria after the 7.8 magnitude quake struck, sending tremors across the region. CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said earlier that shaking from the quake could be felt up to 300 kilometers away (186 miles) from the epicenter.  Journalist Eyad Kourdi, who lives in the southern Turkish city of Gaziantep and was staying with his parents when the earthquake struck early Monday, said ""it felt like it would never be over."" When the shaking stopped, Kourdi and his parents walked out of their home still wearing their pajamas, he said.  With several inches of snow on the ground, they waited outside in the rain for about 30 minutes before he could go back inside to grab coats and boots.   Harsh weather: A winter storm in the region is exacerbating the disaster, according to CNN meteorologists.  ""Hundreds of thousands of people are impacted by this. It is cold. It is rainy. Roads could be impacted, that means your food, your livelihood, the care for your children, the care for your family,"" CNN meteorologist Karen Maginnis said. 
""Anything as far as crops or anything growing across this region will be impacted as well. The ramifications of this are broad and will impact this region for weeks, and months."" The White Helmets, also known as the Syrian Civil Defense, on Monday declared the northwest of the country as a ""disaster area"" following the powerful 7.8 magnitude earthquake that hit neighboring Turkey, sending tremors across the region. The group said hundreds of people have been injured and trapped under rubble and dozens have died, but didn't specify exact numbers. ""We call on all local authorities and civil forces to mobilize their cadres, and we recommend all humanitarian, health and relief organizations operating in Syria to share work according to the system of parity and their geographical distribution in order to ensure that the necessary needs are covered as much as possible,"" the White Helmets said in a statement.  Much of northwestern Syria, which borders Turkey, is controlled by anti-government forces amid a bloody civil war that began in 2011. According to Syrian State TV, citing the Ministry of Health, the earthquake Monday has killed at least 111 people and injured 516 others in the Syrian regions of Aleppo, Latakia, Hama and Tartus. At least 111 people have died and 516 others were injured in Syria after a strong earthquake hit neighboring southern Turkey early Monday, Syrian State TV reported, citing the Ministry of Health. The deaths were reported in the regions of Aleppo, Latakia, Hama and Tartus.  The 7.8 magnitude quake is one of the strongest to hit Turkey in more than 100 years and sent tremors across the region that caused buildings to collapse. Nearly 1,000 search and rescue volunteers have been deployed from Turkey's largest city, Istanbul, to the south of the country following the powerful 7.8 magnitude earthquake that struck early Monday. ""80 AFAD (emergency disaster agency) officers, 27 accredited municipalities and NGOs, 968 Search and Rescue volunteers, 4 K9 dogs, 2 trucks and aid materials have been sent to the area impacted by earthquake,"" Istanbul Gov. Ali Yerlikaya wrote on Twitter.  
""Sorry for our loss. I wish our injured a speedy recovery."" At least 118 people were killed in Turkey and Syria after one of the strongest earthquakes to hit Turkey in more than 100 years sent tremors across the region, collapsing buildings and sending residents running into the streets. Turkey's disaster agency has appealed for help from the international community as it conducts search and rescue operations. At least 118 people were killed in two countries after one of the strongest earthquakes to hit Turkey in more than 100 years sent tremors across the region, collapsing buildings and sending residents running into the streets. At least 76 people died and more than 440 were injured in Turkey, according to the country's disaster management agency. In neighboring Syria, at least 42 people died and around 200 more were injured, Syrian state run-news agency SANA reported, citing a Health Ministry official. In Syria, the deaths were reported in Aleppo, Hama and Latakia, SANA said.  The ""White Helmets"" group, officially known as the Syria Civil Defense, also said there were dozens of victims and hundreds trapped under the rubble in the opposition-controlled Idlib region. The quake struck while residents were likely asleep and unprepared for the impact. Video shared on social media shows dozens of collapsed buildings, while frightened residents huddled on the darkened streets amid the chaos.  The deadly powerful earthquake that hit southern Turkey early on Monday could be felt up to 300 kilometers away (186 miles), according to a CNN meteorologist. Dozens of people have been killed in Turkey and neighboring Syria after the 7.8 quake struck; it's tied as the strongest the country has experienced in more than 100 years of records. CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said shaking from the quake could be felt as far away as Lebanon, hundreds of kilometers away. ""All the way down to Lebanon, it was around a 4 to a 4.5 is the equivalency of the magnitude of shaking they felt,"" he said. ""Northern Syria, in Aleppo they felt shaking equivalent to between a 6 and a 6.5 magnitude earthquake.""  Turkish officials say at least 76 people were killed. In Syria, at least 42 people have died and 200 others were injured after buildings collapsed, Syria's state-run news agency SANA reported. ""A quake of this magnitude and in this part of the world, the shaking goes on for a long way. As you get closer to that epicenter, the shaking is greater,"" Miller added. At least 76 people have been killed in Turkey after one of the strongest earthquakes to hit the country in more than 100 years sent tremors across the region, according to Turkish officials. The country's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) said another 440 people have been injured, with search and rescue efforts ongoing. ""All provincial AFAD Directorates were put on alert and all teams, especially search and rescue, were sent to the region,"" AFAD said.  The agency has appealed for help from the international community for its search and rescue operation. The 7.8 magnitude earthquake that struck southern Turkey early Monday is tied as the strongest the country has experienced in more than 100 years of records, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The USGS said an equally powerful 7.8 magnitude quake that hit eastern Turkey in 1939 resulted in more than 30,000 deaths. Karl Lang, an assistant professor at Georgia Tech University's School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, told CNN the area hit by the quake Monday is prone to seismic activity.  ""It's a seismogenic area. It's a very large fault zone, but this is a larger earthquake than they've experienced any time in recent memory,"" Lang said.
""The magnitude of shaking that is felt on the surface is both a function of the amount of energy released, the size of the earthquake, but also how far that energy is released below the surface. So if it is very close to the surface, if it is a shallow earthquake, then it can be very dangerous.""  Earthquakes of this magnitude are rare, with fewer than five occurring per year anywhere in the world, on average.  ""What's really unusual here is that it's a very large earthquake that is also close to the surface,"" Lang said. Some context: Turkey is no stranger to strong earthquakes; seven quakes with magnitude 7.0 or greater have struck the country in the past 25 years —  but Monday's is the most powerful. It is also the strongest quake to hit anywhere in the world since an 8.1 magnitude quake struck a remote region near the South Sandwich Islands in the southern Atlantic Ocean in 2021, resulting in no damage.  At least 42 people have died and 200 others were injured in Syria after a strong earthquake hit southern Turkey early Monday, Syria's state-run news agency SANA reported, citing a Health Ministry official.  The deaths have been reported in the regions of Aleppo, Hama and Latakia, SANA said.  Multiple buildings collapsed in Syria after the earthquake struck neighboring southern Turkey early on Monday, SANA said.  The ""White Helmets"" group, officially known as the Syria Civil Defense, also said there have been dozens of victims and hundreds trapped under the rubble in the opposition-controlled Idlib region. Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Agency (AFAD) on Monday called on the international community for help after a powerful deadly quake hit the south of the country.  AFAD said in a statement it needed international help ""in the field of urban search and rescue."" The quake occurred at 4:17 a.m. local time and was followed by 32 aftershocks, the statement said.  The provinces that felt the quake ""intensely"" across Turkey were Kahramanmaraş, Hatay, Osmaniye, Gaziantep, ��anlıurfa, Diyarbakır, Malatya and Adana, AFAD said. Turkey's Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said search and rescue teams have been dispatched to the south of the country after a deadly powerful quake struck early Monday. ""There are reports from many places. Search and rescue teams have been dispatched to the region. Our first job is to do search and rescue,"" Soylu told state broadcaster TRT.  He added there are some serious traffic jams in some places and asked people to make way for ambulances and rescue teams.  Turkish officials say at least 17 people have been killed after the magnitude 7.8 quake hit. Multiple buildings have collapsed in Syria after a powerful earthquake struck neighboring southern Turkey early on Monday, Syria's state-run news agency SANA reported.  Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) said the quake hit near Kahramanmaras and the city of Gaziantep, close to the Syrian border. An eight-story building collapsed in Syria's Hama province, SANA reported, citing the Hama Fire Brigade. Multiple buildings were also reported to have collapsed in the port city of Latakia and the city of Aleppo, SANA said.  Exams scheduled for Monday in at least two Syrian universities have been postponed, SANA said.  Kerem Kinik, president of Turkey's Red Crescent, said the organization is shipping additional blood supplies to southern Turkey after a deadly earthquake struck early Monday.  ""We are shipping additional blood and blood products to the Deprem region. We have National Blood Stocks for the first stage shipment in our Regional Blood Banks. However, we invite our citizens to donate blood throughout Turkey during the day for additional needs that may occur in the future,"" Kinik tweeted.  The Red Crescent is part of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent movement.  At least 17 people have died in the wake of a 7.8 magnitude earthquake that hit southern Turkey Monday morning.   At least five people from the Osmaniye province have died, Gov. Erdinç Yılmaz told CNN affiliate CNN Turk.  Yılmaz said at least 34 buildings collapsed, according to preliminary data. An additional 12 people have died in Sanliurfa province, Gov. Salih Ayhan told CNN affiliate CNN Turk. Ayhan also said at least 18 buildings have collapsed.  At least 10 provinces across southeastern Turkey have been impacted by the earthquake, according to Turkish authorities.  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan sent his “best wishes” to those affected by the earthquake. At least 17 people were killed when the 7.8-magnitude quake hit southern Turkey in the early hours of Monday, toppling buildings and sending residents running into the streets as aftershocks were felt across the region. Erdogan said the quake was felt in many parts of the country and the Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) of Turkey was on alert to assist the victims. “I convey my best wishes to all our citizens who were affected by the earthquake that occurred in Kahramanmaraş and was felt in many parts of our country. All our relevant units are on alert under the coordination of AFAD,” Erdogan wrote on Twitter. Gaziantep Gov. Davut Gul said on Twitter that ""the earthquake was felt strongly in our city."" Gul advised the public to wait outside their homes and stay calm. “Please let’s wait outside without panic. Let’s not use our cars. Let’s not crowd the main roads. Let’s not keep the phones busy,” he said. The magnitude 7.8 quake hit at a depth of 24.1 kilometers (14.9 miles), 23 kilometers (14.2 miles) east of Nurdagi, Gaziantep province, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) said Monday. Journalist Eyad Kourdi, who lives in the city of Gaziantep, told CNN there were up to eight “very strong” aftershocks in under a minute after the 7.8 magnitude quake struck, causing belongings in his home to fall to the ground.  Many of his neighbors had left their homes following the quake, he added. Strong aftershocks are likely to continue in the hours and even days to come after an earthquake as strong as this one, according to CNN meteorologists. A magnitude 7.8 earthquake has hit southern Turkey, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) said Monday. The quake hit at 4:17 a.m. local time.  The quake’s depth is 24.1 kilometers (14.9 miles), located 23 kilometers (14.2 miles) east of Nurdagi, Gaziantep province, according to the USGS.  Strong aftershocks: Another earthquake of 6.7 magnitude struck 32 kilometers (20 miles) northwest of the epicenter about 11 minutes after the first quake, the USGS said.","{'neg': 0.285, 'neu': 0.488, 'pos': 0.228, 'compound': -0.1779}",809,17.0,0.12333333333333334,0.8586666666666667,0.018,-0.8585,0.129,0.787,0.084,-1.0,-694.5265,-642.352825,976.0,-0.6581483862704919
"5 things to know for February 2: Ice storm, Debt limit, Middle East, Abortion, Crypto",2023-02-02,"Happy Groundhog Day! This morning, many Americans woke up early to see whether Punxsutawney Phil saw his shadow, a sign that supposedly determines whether we can expect six more weeks of winter or an early spring. For what it's worth, that's according to a groundhog's nonscientific forecast -- and his accuracy has historically been a hit or miss. Still, people across the US are enamored with the quirky tradition and are gearing up to participate in a number of celebrations. Here's what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.  (You can get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Ice storm Treacherous wintry conditions due to freezing rain, sleet and ice are wreaking havoc across parts of the South. Texas has been bearing the brunt of a dangerous ice storm that has already caused power outages for nearly 400,000 homes and businesses, according to PowerOutage.US. Air travel in parts of the region has been halted and authorities are warning drivers to avoid poor road conditions across Texas as well as surrounding states -- including Oklahoma, Arkansas and Tennessee. Meanwhile, the Northeast is bracing for a blast of bitterly cold air that could feel well below freezing. More than 15 million people are expected to be under a wind chill watch or warning in the Northeast beginning as early as today through at least Saturday. 2. Debt limit House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is signaling optimism that both he and President Joe Biden can reach a consensus on the nation's debt limit ""long before"" the US reaches default. ""I think that at the end of the day, we can find common ground,"" McCarthy said after a highly anticipated White House meeting on Wednesday, despite previously exchanging political jabs with the president on the matter. House Republicans want spending reductions, but the White House had previously said it will not offer concessions or negotiate on raising the debt ceiling. Although McCarthy didn't walk away from the meeting with an agreement in hand, he called it ""a good first meeting,"" noting that the White House and the new House GOP majority still ""have different perspectives on this."" 3. Middle East Amid high tensions in Israel and the Palestinian territories, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told CNN this week that any measurable progress toward a long-term peace agreement is unlikely anytime soon. Netanyahu made it clear that while he's ""open"" to negotiations with the Palestinians and is willing to cooperate with them on security matters, not much else will move. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken also made a trip to Israel and the West Bank this week and expressed concerns about the crisis that's showing no signs of de-escalation. Blinken's visit comes after Palestinians and Israelis suffered significant bloodshed last week. Thursday was the deadliest day for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank in nearly two years, followed by a shooting near a Jerusalem synagogue Friday, which Israel has deemed one of its worst terror attacks in recent years.

Abortion Republican attorneys general from 20 states wrote letters to executives at CVS and Walgreens warning the pharmacy chains against using the mail to dispense abortion pills in their states. The letters rebuke recent guidance from the Justice Department and go against a new Biden administration policy that allows certified pharmacies to dispense abortion pills with a prescription, including by mail order. Several states restrict medication abortion, some with blanket bans and others with specific limits on access to abortion pills. CVS and Walgreens have said that they intend to comply with federal and state law with their plans to dispense mifepristone, one of the two drugs used in medication abortion. This comes as a new Gallup poll finds Americans are broadly unsatisfied with the country's policies on abortion. 5. Crypto A record $3.8 billion worth of cryptocurrency was stolen from various services last year, according to a report published Wednesday. The increase in crypto heists, from $3.3 billion in 2021, came as the overall market for cryptocurrencies suffered significant declines. Some of the biggest thefts were driven by North Korean-linked hackers, blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis said in the report. US officials worry Pyongyang will use money stolen from crypto hacks to fund its illicit nuclear and ballistic weapons program. North Korean hackers have stolen the equivalent of billions of dollars in recent years by raiding cryptocurrency exchanges, according to the UN. In an effort to combat digital criminals, law enforcement and national security agencies say they are cracking down on more advanced money laundering techniques.  BREAKFAST BROWSE Tom Brady retires (again) The decorated NFL quarterback announced on Wednesday that he's hanging up his cleats -- ""for good"" this time.

Israel targets Gaza with airstrikes after intercepting rocket attack,2023-02-02,"Israel carried out airstrikes in Gaza early on Thursday after intercepting a rocket attack from the coastal enclave, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said. In a Twitter post, the IDF said Israeli fighter jets targeted a chemical production site and a weapons manufacturing facility owned by Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that runs Gaza.  ""The IDF holds Hamas responsible for all terrorism activity emanating from Gaza and it will face the consequences of the security violations against Israel,"" the IDF wrote. On Wednesday, the IDF reported that one rocket fired from Gaza had been intercepted by the IDF Aerial Defense Array. On Thursday, it released two videos of the airstrikes, filmed in black and white, that showed huge plumes of dark smoke in the air and pieces of debris falling to the ground. It's not clear whether there were any casualties. The official Palestinian News & Information Agency reported that F-16 warplanes had launched at least five missiles at a ""site"" in the central Gaza Strip, setting it on fire and damaging nearby homes. Two missiles also hit agricultural land in the central area, it said. The strike comes after a period of bloodshed on both sides. Last Thursday Israeli forces killed nine Palestinians and wounded several others in the West Bank city of Jenin, in the deadliest day for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank in nearly two years. This was followed by a shooting near a Jerusalem synagogue Friday night, which Israel has deemed one of its worst terror attacks in recent years. It also follows US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's trip to Israel and the West Bank this week, which some had hoped would help cool rising tensions.  The Biden administration has been careful in its language and sought to publicly avoid criticizing the new government in Israel, which is led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and includes controversial far-right ministers.  On Wednesday, Blinken reiterated the administration's goal of a two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians, and said the US ""will continue to oppose anything that puts that goal further from reach."" Last year was the deadliest for both Palestinians in the West Bank and for Israelis in nearly two decades, CNN analysis of official statistics on both sides showed.","{'neg': 0.279, 'neu': 0.721, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.4767}",15,19.0,0.175,0.782,0.043,-0.5994,0.128,0.812,0.06,-0.985,-8.991000000000001,-609.5689500000001,982.0,-0.6207423116089614
"February 1, 2023 Russia-Ukraine news",2023-01-31,"Our live coverage of Russia's war in Ukraine has moved here. More than 100 police officers are working to rescue people from the rubble after a missile attack in Kramatorsk, Ukraine, according to Donetsk region police. The strike killed at least 3 people, police said. ""Russian troops targeted the residential area of the city with an 'Iskander-K' missile. At least 8 apartment buildings were damaged, one of them was completely destroyed. Preliminarily, it is known about 3 dead civilians and 20 wounded. People may remain under the rubble,"" the police said on Telegram. The attack happened at 9:45 p.m. local time Wednesday. A search and rescue operation is underway.  Authorities are evacuating people to a local school for shelter. In the town of Krasnohorivka, Ukraine, grim Soviet-era apartment buildings stand nearly but not quite empty, with only a few residents remaining.  Blocks on the southern edges of town are burned shells, windows shattered and awnings dangling in the winter breeze. Houses are largely shuttered; their tenants long gone. The central square is abandoned and eerie. On Wednesday, a few civilians moved gingerly along icy pavements to a small store that seemed still to be open. A man cycled past with a load of firewood.  Then a Russian rocket propelled grenade burst in the ice-grey sky above — a reminder of the potent threat carried by the enemy. While the world’s attention has been focused on the city of Bakhmut as the vortex of the conflict in Ukraine, fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces has been as relentless elsewhere. Areas south and west of the city of Donetsk — particularly the towns of Krasnohorivka and Vuhledar — have seen combat for much of the war: a punishing mix of trench warfare and longer-range rocket fire as each side probes for weaknesses. Progress here for the Russians is vital if they are to realize President Vladimir Putin’s goal of winning all of the Donetsk region. At the moment, they are going nowhere. Just to the north of Krasnohorivka, an elaborate system of trenches marks Ukraine’s forward defensive positions. More than two meters deep in the dark brown earth, the trenches extend for hundreds of meters, and in some places are within half a kilometer of Russian positions. In the distance, a huge snow-covered slag heap rises out of the mist, like a ski slope in the wrong place. A Ukrainian commander, who gave his first name as Bogdan, describes the situation as “controlled but tense” — a euphemism favored by the Ukrainian military for “very active.” “The enemy is always searching for weak spots, but they don’t find them because we have a very durable defense,” Bogdan says. “Any enemy attempts are cut down immediately.” His unit says it likes to take the fight to the enemy rather than wait to attack, to try to sap the Russians’ morale. As they fired Wednesday, the men occasionally yelled to each other: “Best job in the world.” Read more here.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the Russian strike that hit a residential building in Kramatorsk late Wednesday. ""This is not a repetition of history; this is the daily reality of our country. A country bordering absolute evil. And a country that has to overcome it in order to reduce to zero the likelihood of such tragedies happening again,"" he said on his official Telegram channel. ""We will definitely find and punish all the perpetrators. They do not deserve mercy,"" he concluded. Zelensky expressed condolences to the families and friends of the victims. At least two people were killed and eight were wounded.  Advocacy group Human Rights Watch (HRW) has urged Ukraine to investigate its military’s ""apparent"" use of rocket-fired antipersonnel landmines in and around the eastern city of Izium when Russian forces occupied the area. In new research published Tuesday, HRW said it documented ""numerous cases in which rockets carrying PFM antipersonnel mines, also called 'butterfly mines' or 'petal mines,' were fired into Russian-occupied areas near Russian military facilities.""  “Ukrainian forces appear to have extensively scattered landmines around the Izium area, causing civilian casualties and posing an ongoing risk,” Arms Division director at HRW Steve Goose said.
“Russian forces have repeatedly used antipersonnel mines and committed atrocities across the country, but this doesn’t justify Ukrainian use of these prohibited weapons,"" Goose added. ""The use of antipersonnel mines violates international humanitarian law because they cannot discriminate between civilians and combatants,"" HRW said. Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has said the report will be ""duly analyzed by the relevant Ukrainian institutions."" ""Ukraine, exercising its right to self-defense in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter, fully fulfills its international obligations against the background of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide of the Ukrainian people committed by the Russian occupiers,"" the ministry said in response to the HRW report. Ukrainian forces retook Izium in September 2022, after six months of Russian occupation, marking a huge strategic loss for the Russian military. At least two people were killed and eight wounded late Wednesday after Russian forces shelled the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk, officials said. ""Two hours ago, Russian occupants hit a residential building in the city center with a missile and completely destroyed it,"" Pavlo Kyrylenko, the head of the Donetsk region military administration said on his Telegram channel. ""Rescuers, law enforcement, and public utilities are working at the scene to dismantle the rubble of the destroyed building. It is possible that there may be people under the rubble,"" he said. In a statement, the Prosecutor General's Office said eight people ""sustained injuries of varying severity.""  Andriy Yermak, the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, said Russia had targeted civilians. He added: ""Russia is a terrorist state."" See the tweet:  This post was updated with the latest casualty report. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Wednesday he would make as many personnel changes as necessary to guarantee the rule of law. His words come after Ukrainian authorities conducted a series of anti-corruption searches and crackdowns across the country – including a search tied to the helicopter crash last month that left the country’s interior minister dead – to combat what they described as “the internal enemy"" in the country. Hours after Zelensky promised “new reforms,” Ukrainian authorities conducted a series of anti-corruption searches, according to the country’s parliamentary majority leader. ""I thank all law enforcement officers who have demonstrated the strength of law and the state today. I am grateful to the government of ukraine for its prompt personnel response. In particular, today, the heads of customs were dismissed,"" Zelensky said in his daily address. ""Unfortunately, in some areas, the only way to guarantee the rule of law is to change the leadership along with institutional changes. Changing as much as necessary to ensure that people do not get dirty in their positions,"" the president said. ""The purity of processes within the ministry of defense and the defense forces, in general, is especially important. Any internal supply, any procurement – everything must be absolutely as clean and honest as external supplies for our defense. Those who interfere with this will not remain in the relevant structures,"" Zelensky added. CNN's Mick Krever contributed to this report ##Corruption Searches## Organizers for the next Summer Olympics said they will follow the International Olympic Committee’s (IOC) previously announced plan to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to participate at the Games.  In an email to CNN, a Paris 2024 spokesperson reiterated the Olympic qualification system is determined not by their organization but by the IOC, International Paralympic Committee, and international federations. In late January, the IOC outlined a multi-step plan for Russian and Belarusian athletes to participate in Paris and at the 2026 Winter Games in Milan. “No athlete should be prevented from competing just because of their passport,” the IOC’s executive board declared. The Paris 2024 spokesperson said the organization will comply with the sanctions already put in place on Russian and Belarusian athletes by the IOC. In order for athletes from the two countries to compete at the next two Olympics, they would represent as “neutral athletes and in no way represent their state or any other organization in their country,” the IOC said last month. Paris 2024 said it stands in ""full solidarity with Ukraine, its people and the Ukrainian Olympic and Paralympic movements, who are faced with an unimaginable crisis. ... Our wish is that the Olympic movement, the Paralympic movement and the athletes experience the Paris 2024 Games in a spirit of peace, respecting the values of fraternity and solidarity.” Paris is set to host the XXXIII Olympic Summer Games from July 26 to August 11, 2024. CNN’s Sammy Mngqosini contributed reporting to this post.  Ukrainian authorities have conducted a series of anti-corruption raids across the country, uncovering stashes of cash as well as luxury watches and cars.  The Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) said the raids were part of an effort to combat what they described as “the internal enemy” in the country. The raids come as President Volodymyr Zelensky said his government is working on “new reforms” that will make the country “more human, transparent and effective” as he prepares to meet European Union officials on Friday for talks on Ukraine’s possible accession to the bloc. Here are key things to know about the raids:  What was revealed: The acting head of the Kyiv tax authority was allegedly part of a scheme to overlook 45 billion Ukrainian hryvnia ($1.2 billion) in unpaid taxes. On Wednesday, the State Bureau of Investigations (SBI) said that it had found hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, as well as luxury watches and cars, at the tax chief’s residence. CNN is attempting to reach that individual for comment.
The SBU also accused the “former management” of Ukraine’s largest oil extraction and refinery firms of the “misappropriation” of $1.1 billion.
The SBU said the Ministry of Defense’s former head for procurement spent the equivalent of $2.7 million on almost 3,000 bulletproof vests for the Ukrainian armed forces which were later found to be unable to “properly protect Ukrainian soldiers.” Some actions taken so far: Top managers at oil firms PJSC Ukrtatnafta were served with a notice of suspicion of committing criminal offenses, according to the SBU.
It also charged the Ministry of Defense’s former head for procurement with “misappropriation, embezzlement or seizure of property through abuse of office,” obstruction of the armed forces, and “committing a criminal offense by a group of persons.” The individual faced five to eight years in prison, the SBU said, adding that it had recalled the sub-standard vests. The investigation into January's helicopter crash:  Former interior minister Arsen Avakov’s property was searched in connection to an investigation into the Jan. 18 helicopter crash that killed 14 people.
Avakov was interior minister when the ‘Super Puma’ ES-225 helicopter involved in the crash was purchased from France as part of a contract signed in 2018. On Wednesday, he denied any wrongdoing and said that the contracts were approved by parliament. 
As is standard, Ukrainian authorities have said they are investigating all possible causes of the helicopter crash, including pilot error, technical malfunction and sabotage. ##Catch Up## ##Corruption Searches## Britain’s Defense Minister Ben Wallace on Wednesday said that it's the correct decision ""for now"" not to send fighter jets to Ukraine.  “What they need right now is armor and tanks,” Wallace told reporters when asked why the UK would not send jets, pointing to the UK’s commitment to send Challenger 2 tanks to support Kyiv’s troops. “I've been involved in this for a pretty long time and I've learned two things: never rule anything in and never rule anything out,” he said.  Wallace acknowledged this was “not a solid decision,” but added, “for now, I don't think that's the right approach.”  “What’s going to move on this conflict this year is going to be the ability for the Ukrainians to deploy Western armor against Russia,” he continued. Some background: Top Ukrainian officials have been jockeying for US-made F-16 fighter jets, arguing they need them urgently to defend against Russian missile and drone attacks. The defense minister’s comments come after a Downing Street spokesperson told journalists Tuesday that fighter jets are ""extremely sophisticated and take months to learn how to fly,” adding it was “not practical” to supply them to Ukraine. On Wednesday, former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson joined Kyiv in its calls for the jets to be sent to Ukraine during a visit to Washington, DC. “All I will say is that every time we have said it will be a mistake to give such and such an item of weaponry, we end up doing it and it ends up being the right thing for Ukraine,” Johnson told Fox News.  “Save time, save money, save lives. Give the Ukrainians what they need as fast as possible,” he continued.  Following Johnson’s comments, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s official spokesperson noted Johnson was “acting in his own capacity and not on behalf of the UK government,” Britain’s PA news agency reported.  CNN’s Niamh Kennedy contributed reporting to this post. Italy's upcoming package of military aid to Ukraine will probably include weapons of defense against Russian missile attacks, a press officer of the Italian Ministry of Defense confirmed to CNN on Wednesday. Earlier Italy's Defense Minister Guido Crosetto told the Financial Times that Italy was committed to fulfilling Ukraine’s requests for weapons to shore up its defenses but declined to offer any specifics. Crosetto also said that any decision on air defenses would be taken in conjunction with the French government.  The Italian government is working on the sixth package of military support to the war-torn country, the press officer told CNN. Italy has so far approved five military support packages for Ukraine's defense, including both lethal and nonlethal equipment, based on the needs of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. It contributes approximately 390 million euros to the assistance measures provided for by the European Peace Facility, for a total of 3 billion euros. French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu announced on Tuesday that France will send an additional 12 Caesar howitzers to Ukraine on top of the 18 howitzers Paris has already delivered to Kyiv.  Speaking at a press conference in Paris alongside his Ukrainian counterpart Oleksii Reznikov, Lecornu said that Denmark has also committed to giving their 19 of French-made howitzers to Ukraine.  The French minister said another priority was the training of Ukrainian troops and that 2,000 of them would be trained in France by the summer.  Correction: This post has been updated to correct the attribution in the first paragraph to a press officer with the Italian Ministry of Defense. A military leader in the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic told Russian media on Wednesday that Moscow's forces have practically encircled the key eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut and active fighting is ongoing.  “Bakhmut has been practically 'embraced' from three sides, an intensive knocking out of the enemy is underway (…),” Col. Vitaly Kiselev said, according to state media TASS. Russian forces are now trying to move into the area of ​​the Ukraine-controlled town of Chasov Yar about six kilometers (more than 3 miles) west of Bakhmut, he added.  “They are trying, and I am sure that they will succeed. [It will succeed] to go to the Chasov Yar area, from where intensive shelling is going on back to Soledar, Bakhmut,” he said. Earlier, retired Lt. Col. of the self-proclaimed LPR, Andrei Marochko, said that Ukrainian troops were going to withdraw to Chasov Yar in the event of a retreat from Bakhmut.  The founder of Russia's Wagner mercenary group Yevgeny Prigozhin said in a Telegram post on Wednesday that Russian forces now control the village of Sacco and Vanzetti, about 20 kilometers (more than 12 miles) from Bakhmut in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine.  ""Today, February 1, 2023, at 16:00 Moscow time, Sacco and Vanzetti were completely taken under control by the assault units of the Wagner PMC,"" Prigozhin's press service Telegram channel said.  The press service also posted a photo of the fighters against the background of the only remaining house in the village. Prigozhin also noted that at the moment there is no operational encirclement of Bakhmut. The Deputy Defense Minister of Ukraine Hanna Maliar has said “heavy fighting” continues in the east with Russian forces making “powerful attempts” to break through Ukrainian defenses of Bakhmut. “The enemy is trying to expand the geography of its offensive in the Lyman sector,” a Russian offensive north of Bakhmut, Maliar said on Telegram. Germany needs to order new Leopard tanks quickly after committing to send 14 of its own to Ukraine, the country’s Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said Wednesday.  “The decisive factor for me is that we have to order new tanks, and not in a year's time, but quickly so that production can begin and we can plan how many new Leopards we will have available — and when,” Pistorius told reporters on a visit to the town of Augustdorf.  “Where the money comes from — to put it in casual terms, I honestly don't care. What matters is that we deliver quickly,” Pistorius added. Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced the German-made battle tanks would be sent to Kyiv’s troops last week, after intensifying international pressure led by the United States, Poland and a bloc of other European nations, which called on Berlin to step up its military support to Ukraine.  Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov had a ""very frank and productive conversation"" with French President Emmanuel Macron regarding the Ukraine army's ""urgent operational needs for self-defense from the Russian aggressor,"" Reznikov tweeted Wednesday. Reznikov thanked Macron for his ""leadership and unwavering support."" On Wednesday, Reznikov met France Minister of the Armed Forces Sebastien Lecornu in Paris to discuss the needs of the Ukrainian army. The pair signed a memorandum on the supply of MG-200 radars for Ukrainian air defenders. ""This equipment will help us to spot enemy drones & missiles, including ballistic. Our skies will be protected from Russia’s deadly attacks,"" Reznikov tweeted. On Monday, France along with Australia said that they would collaborate on a multi-million dollar project to produce “several thousand” artillery shells for Ukraine. As for Ukraine's plea for fighter jets, Macron said Monday that they have not received any requests for jets, but “nothing is off-limits in principle.” Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his defense ministry to prioritize protecting Russian territory from shelling by Ukrainian forces. Speaking at a video conference regarding the restoration of residential infrastructure, Putin said residential houses in Russia's Belgorod, Bryansk and Kursk regions – as well as Crimea, illegally annexed by Russia in 2014 – were “damaged or destroyed” by the Ukrainian army referring to it as to “shelling by neo-Nazi formations.” “Of course, the priority task is to eliminate the very possibility of shelling, but this is the business of the military department,” Putin said. Many people found themselves in a difficult situation, “they lost their homes, were forced to move to relatives or to temporary places of residence, faced interruptions in the supply of water, heat, and electricity,” he added. The Armed Forces of Ukraine have not officially acknowledged the shelling of the Russian territory. Southwest of the city of Bakhmut, Ukrainian soldiers Andriy and Borisych live in a candle-lit bunker cut into the frozen earth. For several weeks they have been confronting hundreds of fighters belonging to the Russian private military contractor Wagner throwing themselves against Ukrainian defenses. Disguised in a balaclava, Andriy recounts one seemingly endless firefight when they came under attack by a flood of Wagner fighters. “We were fighting for about 10 hours in a row. And it wasn’t like just waves, it was uninterrupted. So it was just like they didn’t stop coming.” Their AK-47 rifles became so hot from constant firing, Andriy says, that they had to keep changing them. “It was about 20 soldiers on our side. And let’s say 200 from their side,” he says. The Wagner way of war is to send a first wave of attackers that mainly comprises raw recruits straight out of Russian prisons. They know little of military tactics and are poorly equipped. Most just hope that if they survive their six-month contract they can go home rather than back to a cell. “They make the group – let’s say from 10 soldiers – reach 30 meters, then they start digging in to keep the position,” Andriy says of Wagner. Another group follows, he says, to claim another 30 meters. “That’s how, step by step, (Wagner) is trying to move forward, while they lose a lot of people in the meantime.” Only when the first wave is exhausted or cut down do Wagner send in more experienced combatants, often from the flanks, in an effort to overrun Ukrainian positions. Andriy says facing the assault was a frightening and surreal experience. “Our machine gunner was almost getting crazy, because he was shooting at them. And he said, I know I shot him, but he doesn’t fall. And then after some time, when he maybe bleeds out, so he just falls down.” Andriy compares the battle to a scene out of a zombie movie. “They’re climbing above the corpse of their friends, stepping on them,” he says. “It looks like it’s very, very likely that they are getting some drugs before attack,” he says, a claim that CNN has not been able independently to verify.

The State Bureau of Investigations (SBI) claimed that it had averted a plot to detonate explosives at a power plant in eastern Ukraine.  “An official of one of the region's law enforcement agencies started collaborating with the enemy,” the SBI said. “He hid explosive devices, ammunition and means of initiating the explosion in a specially equipped cache near the TPP [power plant] in advance, but in the territory controlled by Ukraine.” The alleged collaborator, described as a “former security guard,” was served “in absentia a notice of suspicion of high treason and preparation to commit sabotage,” the SBI said. An explosion at the Kurakhove Thermal Power Plant was to be carried out by an accomplice of the accused, the SBI claimed, adding that it was looking for that person.  The agency released photos that it said showed security forces unearthing explosives. CNN has seen no previous reports of an explosives plot at that plant. The SBI claim was made as part of anti-corruption searches and crackdowns across the country in an effort to combat what they described as “the internal enemy"" in the country, according to Ukrainian authorities. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said Wednesday that it had charged the Ministry of Defense’s former head for procurement with embezzlement as part of anti-corruption searches and crackdowns across the country. At issue, it said, was the purchase of thousands of substandard protective vests. “According to the investigation, this official purchased nearly 3,000 bulletproof vests for the Armed Forces of Ukraine for over UAH 100 million,” or $2.7 million. “However, according to several independent examinations, these products do not meet the requirements of class IV bulletproof vests and cannot properly protect Ukrainian soldiers.” The SBU said that the official was charged with “misappropriation, embezzlement or seizure of property through abuse of office,” obstruction of the armed forces, and “committing a criminal offense by a group of persons.” The SBU said that the individual faced five to eight years in prison, and had recalled the sub-standard vests. “In addition, the SBU is conducting investigative actions against other officials in the security and defense sector who may be involved in illegal activities that harm state security. This is a set of measures aimed at strengthening the defense capabilities of our state.” More on the searches: Ukrainian authorities on Wednesday said they conducted the series of anti-corruption searches and crackdowns in an effort to combat what they described as “the internal enemy"" in the country. ##Corruption Searches## Russia is gearing up for a “maximum escalation” of the war in Ukraine, potentially as soon as the next few weeks, according to a top Ukrainian national security official. “These will be defining months in the war,” Oleksiy Danilov, Secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, told Sky News in an interview broadcast Tuesday.  “I’m conscious the main fights are yet to come and they will happen this year, within two to three months,” he said. “Russia is preparing for maximum escalation. It is gathering everything possible, doing drills and training. When it comes to an offensive from different directions, as of now, I can say that we are not excluding any scenario in the next two to three weeks.” Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence believes that the war is “on the edge” of a “very active” period. ""We are on the edge of a very active phase of hostilities, February and March will be very active,” Andriy Yusov, representative of Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence, said on national television. Ukrainian officials have warned for some time of a renewed Russian offensive and have asked for more powerful weaponry from Western allies to counter the threat. Following Danilov's comments, a Ukrainian military spokesperson said Wednesday that  there a signs Russia is preparing for a renewed offensive in southern Ukraine. “Not just on land, but on the sea and in air as well,” Natalia Humeniuk, head of the United Coordinating Press Center of Security and Defense Forces of the South of Ukraine, said on national television. Ukrainian intelligence had noted changes to the activity of Russian naval forces in the Black Sea, she added. “It increases and decreases rapidly, and the missile carriers are moving back and forth,” she said.  Meanwhile, the Belarusian Defense Ministry on Tuesday said it would hold a further week of joint military drills with Russia. ""During the week, military representatives from the two countries will practice joint planning of the use of troops based on the prior experience of armed conflicts in recent years,"" the ministry said in a statement.  CNN's Denis Lapin contributed reporting to this post.  Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky urged the need to increase sanctions against Russia on Wednesday saying that the “terrorist state must feel the price of terror.”  “I stressed the need to increase sanctions against Russia and our team stressed that the terrorists state must feel the price of a terror and its capacity to continue aggression should be restricted,” Zelensky said in a news conference after meeting with Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen in Kyiv. Zelensky continued to put pressure on Austrian businesses to “step up” their cooperation with Ukraine and help to rebuild and modernize the country’s energy systems, telling businesses to leave Russia and set up in Ukraine. “We know the situation concerning Austrian business, which despite the brutal Russian terror, are not leaving Russia, and continue to support the terrorist state, we believe with their own taxes,” Zelensky said. “And therefore, we would like these businesses to go to Ukraine instead.” He also urged individual Austrian companies not to “betray Austrian society,” saying it’s an important issue which will be resolved on the basis of “shared values of freedom, democracy and human rights.” Zelensky’s comments come as Van der Bellen visited Kyiv on Wednesday to discuss financial and humanitarian aid for Ukraine.  Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he would be willing to serve as mediator between Ukraine and Russia. In an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper on Tuesday, Netanyahu said he was asked to mediate not long after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February of last year but declined the offer as he was not prime minister at the time. “I was opposition leader at the time and I said, well I have a rule; one prime minister at a time,” he said.  When asked if he would agree to it now, Netanyahu said: “If asked by all relevant parties, I’ll certainly consider it but I’m not pushing myself.”  “I’ve been around long enough to know that there has to be the ripe time and the ripe circumstances. If they arise, I will certainly consider it,"" he told CNN.  He added that he would want the United States in particular to ask him as “you can’t have too many cooks in the kitchen, and we have our own backyard to deal with.” Netanyahu also stressed during the interview that he had a good relationship with US President Joe Biden, saying: “I think President Biden’s commitment to Israel is real, it’s not just words, it’s genuine, it comes from the heart. And my commitment to the alliance with the United States is real.”  He said that Washington and Tel Aviv had disagreed on many things, including Iran, but the alliance between the two countries “had to be unshakeable.” The Austrian President has arrived in Kyiv, according to a post on his Twitter account. Later, Van der Bellen also posted a photo of himself in the Ukrainian town of Bucha on Twitter, commenting “Here in #Bucha, I mourn for every single life destroyed by this terrible war of aggression. These crimes against humanity, against everything we stand for, must not be forgotten and must not go unpunished.”  He has also met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.  As he announced his visit on Twitter, he said: “This trip is a gesture for peace, a sign of solidarity with Ukrainians.”  Ukrainian authorities' nationwide anti-corruption searches included the search of former interior minister Arsen Avakov’s property. It was tied to an investigation into the Jan. 18 helicopter crash that killed 14, including the then-Interior Minister Denis Monastyrsky, according to Avakov. Avakov was interior minister when the ‘Super Puma’ ES-225 helicopter involved in the crash was purchased from France as part of a contract signed in 2018. On Wednesday, he denied any wrongdoing. “The investigating authorities did indeed conduct a search of my place – as part of working out one of the operational versions of the causes of the tragedy in Brovary,” Avakov said in a statement on Telegram. “The investigation was interested in the contracts for the purchase of Super Puma helicopters (Airbus Helicopters H225) by the Ministry of Internal Affairs.” He said that the contracts were approved by parliament, and that the helicopters “have saved and will save thousands of lives.” “The investigators behaved correctly, although the expediency of such investigative action looks a little dull, six years after the contract was concluded. Naturally, nothing corresponding to the interests of the investigation was found,” he added.  As is standard, Ukrainian authorities have said they are investigating all possible causes of the helicopter crash, including pilot error, technical malfunction, and sabotage. ##Corruption Searches##   Ukrainian authorities on Wednesday conducted a series of anti-corruption searches across the country. One of the initiatives as part of this series was the unsealing of an alleged scheme by the acting head of the Kyiv tax authority to look the other way on 45 billion Ukrainian hryvnia ($1.2 billion) in unpaid taxes. The State Bureau of Investigations (SBI) said that it had found hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, as well as luxury watches and cars, at the residence of the head of the Kyiv tax authority.  The head of the Kyiv tax authority, “along with other members of the commission, made decisions on compliance or non-compliance with the risk criteria of taxpayers without legal grounds, which led to serious consequences,” the SBI said. “The tax officials ‘do not notice’ these schemes, support their existence, or directly participate in them for systematic payment for their ‘services,’” the SBI said in a statement. “As part of the criminal investigation into the abuse of power that caused grave consequences, SBI officers are conducting searches at the suspect's residence and workplace. During the investigation, they have already found 158,000 US Dollars, 530,000 Ukrainian hryvnia, 2,200 euros, luxury watches, cars, etc.” The SBI released photos of the cash and luxury goods it said were found at the tax chief’s residence. David Arakhamia, the parliamentary majority leader, said that the “entire management of the customs” agency has been dismissed, there have been “searches in the State Tax Service,” and that authorities have served “notices of suspicion to senior officials of the Ministry of Defense.” The recent findings from the anti-corruption searches come after President Volodymyr Zelensky fired a slew of senior Ukrainian officials amid a growing corruption scandal linked to the procurement of war-time supplies, in the biggest shakeup of his government since Russia’s invasion began. ##Corruption Searches## According to Western officials, Russia is unlikely to see strategic success in any potential offensive in Ukraine this spring due to limited support on force ratios, equipment and logistics. And, hours after President Volodymyr Zelensky promised “new reforms,” Ukrainian authorities on Wednesday conducted a series of anti-corruption searches across the country, according to the country’s parliamentary majority leader. Here are the latest updates:  ""Maximum escalation:"" Russia is gearing up for a “maximum escalation” of the war in Ukraine, potentially as soon as the next few weeks, according to a top Ukrainian national security official. “These will be defining months in the war,” Oleksiy Danilov, Secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, told Sky News. 
Spring offensive: According to Western officials, Russia is struggling to replace its losses in Ukraine ahead of a possible spring offensive. Limitations on equipment and logistics might not prevent Russia “from trying to launch an offensive,” but their “ability to change the course of the conflict at the moment is constrained,” the officials said.
Anti-corruption searches: Hours after President Volodymyr Zelensky promised “new reforms,” Ukrainian authorities on Wednesday conducted a series of anti-corruption searches across the country, according to the country’s parliamentary majority leader. Zelensky announced on Tuesday that his administration is preparing to introduce changes ahead of talks between Kyiv and the European Union scheduled for Friday.
Fighter jets: Top Ukrainian officials have in recent days escalated their public lobbying campaign for US-made F-16 fighter jets, arguing they need them urgently to defend against Russian missile and drone attacks. But that push is being met with skepticism by US and allied officials who say the jets would be impractical.
Bakhmut turned to ""total ruin:"" Russian troops are pummeling the eastern Ukrainian town of Bakhmut into what the Donetsk region military administration head Pavlo Kyrylenko called a “total ruin.” Two people were killed on Tuesday, including one underage boy, Kyrylenko said on Telegram. Four civilians were wounded, he added. ##Catch Up## Hours after President Volodymyr Zelensky promised “new reforms,” Ukrainian authorities on Wednesday conducted a series of anti-corruption searches across the country, according to the country’s parliamentary majority leader. David Arakhamia announced on Telegram that authorities were conducting a “spring raid campaign instead of sowing campaign.” Alongside “a whole series of covert investigative actions,” Arakhamia said that property searches were conducted of former Interior Minister Arsen Avakov, businessman Ihor Kolomoisky, and politician Vadim Stolar. He said that the “entire management of the customs” agency has been dismissed, there have been “searches in the State Tax Service,” and that authorities have served “notices of suspicion to senior officials of the Ministry of Defense.” “The country will change during the war,” he said. “If someone is not ready for change, the state will come and help them change.” Zelensky announced on Tuesday that his administration is preparing to introduce changes ahead of talks between Kyiv and the European Union scheduled for Friday.  ""We are preparing new reforms in Ukraine. Reforms that will change the social, legal and political reality in many ways, making it more human, transparent and effective,"" Zelensky said in a video address, adding that further details would be announced at a later date.  Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal had announced the ""summit"" earlier on Tuesday but provided no details on who would attend. Shmyhal told Politico in an interview published Monday that Ukraine, which was granted EU candidate status in June last year, has an ""ambitious plan"" to join the bloc within the next two years. ##Corruption Searches## Moscow said on Wednesday that there are few signs suggesting that the Russia-US dialogue on the nuclear arms control treaty will continue but the agreement is “important” as it is the only one that is still viable. “We consider the continuation of the [START] treaty very important. It is actually the only one that still remains, hypothetically speaking, viable,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call. Peskov went on to accuse Washington of destroying the basis for the treaty with NATO’s military infrastructure “working against” Russia which “creates very hostile conditions.” “We see that the United States has actually destroyed the legal basis in the field of arms control and security,” Peskov said. “We see how the entire military infrastructure of NATO works against the Russian Federation. We see how the entire NATO intelligence infrastructure -- including reconnaissance aircraft and satellite constellations -- works 24/7 in the interests of the Ukrainian regime,” he added. “Of course, all this creates very hostile conditions for us, which we cannot ignore.” Peskov’s comment came after the US State Department accused Russia of violating its obligations under the New START Treaty -- a key nuclear arms control agreement with the United States.  The vice-president of the German parliament, or Bundestag, has arrived in Kyiv, she said on Twitter. “Kyiv. I arrived here today by night train,” Katrin Goering-Eckardt said. “Ukrainians are defending their country & our common freedom. I admire their courage. In the next few days, I would like to get a picture of the reconstruction, the humanitarian situation and the difficult everyday life on the ground.” Goering-Eckardt's trip comes after Germany confirmed last week it will send a long-demanded contingent of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine in a major sign of support for Kyiv. The announcement made for a landmark moment that followed weeks of intense pressure on Berlin from some of its NATO allies. Goering-Eckardt expressed her support for the decision, writing on Twitter on January 24: ""The #Leopard's freed!"" However, on Germany's streets, reactions were mixed, with some citizens telling CNN that they were concerned about how the war may now escalate.  Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi pledged Wednesday to uphold the country's sanctions against Russia over its war in Ukraine after meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in Tokyo. Hayashi told Stoltenberg that NATO shares ""fundamental values with Japan,"" according to a statement from Japan's Foreign Ministry.  It is meaningful for Japan — which will chair the G7 summit in May and serve as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council this year — to ""deliver a strong message"" at ""this historical inflection point"" together with NATO, he said. Hayashi and Stoltenberg also exchanged views on the security situation in the Indo-Pacific region, the statement added. On Tuesday, Stoltenberg and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said NATO and Japan would deepen collaboration as the world faces its ""most severe and complex security environment since the end of World War II,"" according to a statement from the Japanese Prime Minister's Office. Last week, Tokyo approved additional sanctions on Moscow, including banning exports to 49 more entities, adding more items to an export ban and freezing assets of individuals tied to the Kremlin, public broadcaster NHK reported. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Tuesday that his administration is preparing to introduce changes ahead of talks between Kyiv and the European Union scheduled for Friday.  ""We are preparing new reforms in Ukraine. Reforms that will change the social, legal and political reality in many ways, making it more human, transparent and effective,"" Zelensky said in a video address, adding that further details would be announced at a later date.  Kyiv is finalizing preparations for the ""summit"" talks, he added.   Some context: Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal announced the ""summit"" earlier on Tuesday but provided no details on who would attend. Holding the meeting in Kyiv is a ""powerful signal to both partners and enemies,"" Shmyhal said at a government meeting. Shmyhal told Politico in an interview published Monday that Ukraine, which was granted EU candidate status in June last year, has an ""ambitious plan"" to join the bloc within the next two years. Australia on Wednesday announced additional sanctions against Iran for supplying drones to Russia in its war on Ukraine. In a news release, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said financial sanctions would be imposed on four Iranian individuals and four entities involved in the production and supply of drones to Moscow. Russia has used Iranian drones across Ukraine with relentless ferocity, targeting both civilian areas and key infrastructure. The sanctions are among wider measures announced Wednesday by Australia against individuals in Iran and Myanmar for alleged human rights abuses. “Australia stands with the people of Myanmar, the people of Iran and with the people of Ukraine,” the Foreign Ministry statement read. 
“We employ every strategy at our disposal towards upholding human rights – ranging from dialogue and diplomacy to sanctions – consistent with our values and our interests.” Last month, the United States sanctioned seven Iranian officials tied to an Iranian defense manufacturer that designs and produces drones which have been used by Russia in the war in Ukraine.  Russia and Belarus are conducting a further week of joint military drills, the Belarusian Defense Ministry said on Tuesday, the latest sign of cooperation between the neighboring allies amid Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. ""During the week, military representatives from the two countries will practice joint planning of the use of troops based on the prior experience of armed conflicts in recent years,"" the ministry said in a statement.  The ministry said the aim of the training is to improve the compatibility of the two militaries and is part of preparation for the joint Union Shield 2023 exercises the two countries will hold in Russia in September. The announcement of the new drills comes as Russian and Belarussian aviation combat units continue to conduct training missions during joint flight and tactical exercises of the air forces of the two countries. The exercises are being held at the Ruzhansky training grounds in Belarus about 150 kilometers (93 miles) north of the Ukrainian border. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin has backed a plan to set up joint military training centers with Belarus, according to Agence France-Presse.  In a decree published Tuesday, Putin tasked the defense and foreign ministers to conduct talks with Belarus and sign an agreement to establish the facilities, AFP reported. The document did not specify where they would be based. Some context: An announcement by Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko in October that his country and Russia would form a joint regional force and carry out exercises set off alarm bells in Kyiv. The last time Belarus and Russia forces held joint exercises, in February last year, many of those Russian forces went on to cross the Ukrainian border in their ill-fated drive towards the capital. But Western officials speaking to media on background this week have expressed doubt that Russia could launch an offensive from Belarus in the coming months.  The Russian troops' presence would, however, prompt Ukraine into stationing its troops in that direction to ""offset that potential risk,"" the officials said, even though they stressed it is ""hugely unlikely"" that Belarus ""will be an axis of advance in the next several months.” Top Ukrainian officials have in recent days escalated their public lobbying campaign for US-made F-16 fighter jets, arguing they need them urgently to defend against Russian missile and drone attacks. But that push is being met with skepticism by US and allied officials who say the jets would be impractical, both because they require considerable training and because Russia has extensive anti-aircraft systems that could easily shoot them down. More puzzling to US officials is why Ukraine has made such a public show of asking for F-16s, when in private the jets are rarely mentioned atop Ukraine’s wish list of weapons. In private conversations US officials at the Pentagon and the White House have had with Ukrainians over the last several months, fighter jets have not ranked highly on the country’s list of priorities, officials said. Instead, Ukraine has been much more focused on long-range missiles — which the US is reluctant to hand over — as well as more ammunition, air defenses and tanks, which are now on their way after a dramatic public debate among NATO allies. The Europeans have had a similar experience. French President Emmanuel Macron and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said Monday that while “nothing is off-limits in principle,” neither the Netherlands nor France had received any official requests from Ukraine to send the fighter jets. Read the full story: Russian troops are pummeling the eastern Ukrainian town of Bakhmut into what the Donetsk region military administration head Pavlo Kyrylenko called a “total ruin.”  Two people were killed Tuesday, including a child, Kyrylenko said on Telegram. Four civilians were wounded, he added.  “Russians are levelling Bakhmut to the ground, killing everyone they can reach. We are carefully documenting all war crimes. They will be held accountable for everything!,” he wrote on Telegram. CNN reported in January that the US and Western officials are urging Ukraine to shift its focus from the brutal, months-long fight in the Bakhmut and prioritize instead a potential offensive in the south, using a different style of fighting that takes advantage of the billions of dollars in new military hardware recently committed by Western allies. Russia is unlikely to see strategic success in any potential offensive in Ukraine this spring due to limited support on force ratios, equipment and logistics, according to Western officials speaking to media on background. These limitations might not prevent Russia “from trying to launch an offensive,” but their “ability to change the course of the conflict at the moment is constrained,” the officials said. Moscow is struggling to replace its losses, the officials added. “There are severe constraints to their ability to really backfill the losses that they have suffered in Ukraine, which is why you see them reach out to international partners to try to fill the gap,"" they said. Russia and Ukraine were fundamentally in ""a race"" as to ""who can maintain the supply of weapons,” they said. Moscow's current offensive is more about “the existing manpower and equipment being deployed and redeployed locally. You're seeing people kind of taking offensive action, but I don't think you're seeing the beginning of the offensive in big strategic terms. It's unlikely that hundreds of thousands of mobilized reservists have been formed into cohesive formations capable of major offensive, maneuver operations,” the officials explained. Belarus' role: Meanwhile, the officials expressed doubt in Russia using its neighboring ally Belarus to launch an offensive in the coming months.  “Belarus is providing a useful training ground for Russian forces where they can outsource for training and then siphon them back round into the front line in Ukraine,” the officials said. “We do see Russian forces in Belarus. We don't see them deployed to the border, and at the moment, they don't have the kind of capability in the logistics to project and threaten Kyiv.” But the Russian troops' presence would prompt Ukraine into stationing its troops in that direction to ""offset that potential risk,"" the officials said, even though they stressed it is ""hugely unlikely"" that Belarus ""will be an axis of advance in the next several months.” Russia is violating a key nuclear arms control agreement with the United States and continuing to refuse to allow inspections of its nuclear facilities, a State Department spokesperson said Tuesday. “Russia is not complying with its obligation under the New START Treaty to facilitate inspection activities on its territory. Russia’s refusal to facilitate inspection activities prevents the United States from exercising important rights under the treaty and threatens the viability of U.S.-Russian nuclear arms control,” the spokesperson said in statement.
“Russia has also failed to comply with the New START Treaty obligation to convene a session of the Bilateral Consultative Commission in accordance with the treaty-mandated timeline.” The US announcement is likely to increase tensions with relations between the two countries in the doldrums as Moscow continues its war on Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s nuclear saber rattling during the war has alarmed the US and its allies. In December, Putin warned of the “increasing” threat of nuclear war, and this month, Dmitry Medvedev, deputy head of Russia’s Security Council, threatened that Russia losing the war could “provoke the outbreak of a nuclear war.” Read more here. Russian airborne units have joined Wagner mercenary fighters in the battle for the key eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, according to Maksym Zhorin, a former co-commander of Ukraine's Azov regiment. Zhorin is not fighting on the battlefield but is in contact with Ukrainian soldiers and helps with supplies.  ""Not only the Wagnerites are fighting in the Bakhmut sector on the Russian side,"" Zhorin said on his official Telegram channel Tuesday. ""Previously, the assaults were carried out first by convicts, followed by more 'elite' Wagner units, but now airborne units have also joined the fight,"" he said. Zhorin described several differences between the Russian forces and Wagner troops.  ""First of all, this is notable because of the use of their regular equipment. Wagner's troops are forced to advance on foot, while Russian paratroopers have armored personnel carriers and infantry fighting vehicles, which they actively use,"" Zhorin said. 
""Another difference is that for some reason regular troops are less willing to die than Wagner's men. That is why they act a little more cautiously.

"Opinion: Netanyahu wants peace, but offers few solutions",2023-02-01,"It was a trajectory -- Washington to Cairo, and then Jerusalem -- similar to the one made nearly a half century earlier by a predecessor of Antony Blinken. Starting in 1974, then-Secretary of State Henry Kissinger's ""shuttle diplomacy"" would bring an accord of sorts and a degree of stability to the region following the catastrophic and bloody Yom Kippur War between Israel and its Arab neighbors.    But it would bring little real, lasting peace. Today, 49 years later, there is still no Palestinian state, relations between Israelis and their Palestinian neighbors are as fraught as ever, blood runs in the streets of both places, and the most obdurate, certainly the most right-wing government in Israeli history has just taken power in Jerusalem.  On Tuesday, Blinken wound up three days of meetings with Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.  And in the end, it seems, all sides seemed quite content to stand on some long-entrenched and hardly softening positions. As Blinken was winging his way home, Netanyahu told CNN's Jake Tapper in an exclusive interview on Tuesday, ""For 25 years, the Palestinians who don't want peace with Israel, want to see a peace without Israel, who don't want a state next to Israel, but a state instead of Israel --  they had an effective veto on Israel's expansion of the circle of peace around it."" Netanyahu insisted that he wants negotiations with the Palestinians, which the Palestinians don't want.  The prime minister also told CNN he believed his priority of cementing amicable arrangements with all Arab nations, as the Abraham Accords provided, would eventually drive the Palestinians to the peace table, effectively on his terms.    ""If we make peace with Saudi Arabia, [which] depends on the Saudi leadership, and bring effectively the Arab-Israeli conflict to an end, I think we'll circle back to the Palestinians and get a workable peace with the Palestinians. I think that's possible,"" Netanyahu told Tapper.  By contrast, Abbas emerged from his meeting with Blinken and asserted, ""the Israeli Government is responsible for what's happening these days, because of its practices that undermine the two-state solution and violate the signed agreements, and because of the lack of international efforts to dismantle the occupation and the settlement regimes, and the failure to recognize the Palestinian state and its full membership in the United Nations."" Throughout his visit, and especially at its end, Blinken was most careful to treat Palestinians and Israelis even-handedly, promising America's ""support [for] all efforts to move us closer to peace, expand the horizon of hope, advance equal rights and opportunities for Palestinians and Israelis.""    But he was quite clear on the profound challenges in all three cities he'd visited where ""I heard a deep concern about the current trajectory."" And he was equally clear that America continues to support a two-state solution -- independent states of Israelis and Palestinians -- a concept that Palestinians believe is not shared by the Netanyahu government .  ""Restoring calm is our immediate task, but over the longer term we have to do more than just lower tensions,"" Blinken explained. ""It's President Biden's firm conviction that the only way to achieve that goal is through preserving and then realizing the vision of two states for two peoples. The United States will continue to oppose anything that puts that goal further from reach, including but not limited to settlement expansion, legalization of illegal outposts, a move towards annexation of the West Bank, disruption to the historic status quo on Jerusalem's holy sites, demolitions and evictions, and incitement and acquiescence to violence."" Quite a heavy lift considering what Netanyahu told Tapper.   Indeed, it would seem that the government Netanyahu leads is determined to press forward on initiatives only calculated to inflame passions on both sides. His public security minister, Itamar Ben Gvir, has been convicted for inciting anti-Arab racism. While Aryeh Deri, leader of the ultra-Orthodox Sephardi party Shas, was forced to step down as interior minister by the nation's high court, he is expected to return after Netanyahu's ruling coalition pledged its support. At the same time, the right-wing dominated Knesset awarded to Bezalel Smotrich -- a religious-Zionist leader of the settler movement -- supervision of the Jewish territories that Palestinians have long claimed for themselves.  Passions continued to rise, as an Israeli army raid on the Jenin refugee camp last week left 10 Palestinians dead and was followed by an attack by a Palestinian gunman on a Jerusalem synagogue that left seven dead.  In the past week at least 22 people have been killed in violent incidents.   Amid such a tense atmosphere it seems unlikely that some key Middle East nations, particularly Saudi Arabia, will have any incentive to establish a working relationship with Israel that could lead to a lasting peace.  At Davos, before the latest deadly confrontations between Israelis and Palestinians, Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud told the World Economic Forum, ""Palestine remains an important evocative issue in our region... the focus really needs to be on a pathway to resolving this conflict.""  Netanyahu clearly has staked out consistent priorities that could make any such accommodation unlikely. ""Israel should have the overriding security responsibility [for Israeli territories] because every time we moved out, say from Lebanon, basically Iran came in with its proxy Hezbollah,"" he told CNN. ""We moved out of Gaza and other radical Islamists, Hamas, took over. And if we just walk away as people suggest, then you'll have Hamas and Iran move into the hills around Jerusalem, overlooking Tel Aviv.""    Hardly a recipe for any quick or easy diplomatic breakthrough. But if the overarching purpose of Blinken's visit was to engage with the government of Netanyahu -- who has had a longstanding, sometimes fraught relationship with President Biden -- without burning any new bridges, then the Secretary of State may have left in the nick of time.   In April, as they often do, Ramadan and Passover will overlap. A recipe for another round of a conflict that is little closer to resolution.  Still, as Netanyahu pointed out to Tapper, and negotiators harking back to Kissinger have recognized, deeply flawed though Israel may be, it is the only working democracy in the Middle East.   The US has little alternative, then, to support it and do its best to hold up a mirror to its faults, praying it will do the right thing for all who live within its borders and abroad.

Netanyahu outlines vision for two-state solution -- without Palestinian sovereignty,2023-02-01,"A shocking 48 hours of violence -- bloody even by the standards of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict -- followed immediately by a fortunately timed flying visit from US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, focused the eyes of the world on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this week.  He looked back without blinking.  Sitting down for an exclusive interview with CNN's Jake Tapper, he signaled clearly that it is extremely unlikely Israel and the Palestinians will make any measurable progress toward a long-term peace anytime soon.  Netanyahu made clear that while he's ""open"" to negotiations with the Palestinians and is willing to cooperate with them on security matters, not much else will move.    Netanyahu has never been a full-throated supporter of a two-state solution, weaving in and out of different definitions of what that would mean. But in recent years he's settled on the idea that he'd be open to a Palestinian state - as long as it has no military or security power, an arrangement that would have no parallel among modern sovereign states.  ""I'm certainly willing to have them have all the powers that they need to govern themselves, but none of the powers that can threaten us,"" Netanyahu told Tapper in Jerusalem on Tuesday.  He did provide some new details about his conversations with President Biden on the matter, explaining he once told Biden, ""[A]ny final agreement between Israel and the Palestinians would have Israel controlling security -- overriding security responsibility in the area west of the Jordan.   ""I said, you can't divide who controls the airspace [between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean]. You have to cross it. It takes two minutes for an airplane to cross it. So what, one minute Israel controls it and the other minute the Palestinians? Of course, it's not workable.   ""He said to me, as others have said to me -- 'you know, but that's not perfect sovereignty.'   ""And I said, you're right. But -- I don't know what you'd call it, but it gives them the opportunity to control their lives, to elect their officials, to run their economy, to run their institutions, to have their flag and to have their parliament, but we have to have overriding security control.""  Most Palestinians would view that arrangement as a continuation of the current occupation -- and an unacceptable starting point for peace negotiations.   Collective punishment  Tapper pressed Netanyahu over accusations that Israel is engaging in collective punishment of Palestinians in the wake of two shooting attacks targeting Israelis around Jerusalem that killed seven and wounded five. Measures announced by the Israeli cabinet in response included issuing more gun permits for civilians, increasing security for Jewish settlements in the West Bank and pushing draft legislation that would possibly revoke the Israeli residency of families of those accused of engaging in or supporting terrorism.   Netanyahu claimed he doesn't ""believe in collective punishment,"" although most human rights organizations call actions targeting the families of attackers exactly that.  ""It's not targeting family members. It's targeting family members who were involved in the terror acts or supported it after the act was done ... I think that disincentivizes the terrorists,"" Netanyahu said.   The legislation to revoke residency of families of attackers will likely face legal challenges, something Israeli human rights organization HaMoked has already vowed to do.  Arab peace before Palestinian peace  Netanyahu made clear to Tapper: His priority is normalization with Arab nations before peace with the Palestinians.  After the success of the Abraham Accords, Netanyahu told Tapper he wants to expand the countries in what he calls the ""circle of peace,"" with his top objective being Saudi Arabia.  For years, peace with the Palestinians was seen as a precondition for any normalization agreements between Arab countries and Israel. But Netanyahu argued the Abraham Accords changed the game.  ""I think that the way we're going to succeed is not let the Palestinian tail wag the body of the Arab world,"" he said.   ""If we make peace with Saudi Arabia -- it depends on the Saudi leadership -- and bring, effectively, the Arab-Israeli conflict to an end, I think we will circle back to the Palestinians and get a workable peace with the Palestinians,"" Netanyahu said.   But with rising and concerning levels of violence from all sides, a far-right Israeli government in place under Netanyahu, and a Palestinian Authority led by an increasingly unpopular President Mahmoud Abbas, that may be an overly optimistic game plan.  The digest    US cautions Israel on policies, urges Palestinians to improve governance and accountability   Blinken on Tuesday called for Israelis and Palestinians to de-escalate, stop violence and reduce tensions after a meeting with Abbas in the West Bank. He cautioned against Israeli moves including ""things like settlement expansion, the legalization of [Israeli settler] outposts, demolitions and evictions [of Palestinians from their homes], disruptions to the historic status of the holy sites and of course incitement and acquiescence to violence.""   Background: Blinken's visit comes after Palestinians and Israelis suffered significant bloodshed last week. Thursday was the deadliest day for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank in nearly two years, followed by a shooting near a Jerusalem synagogue Friday night, which Israel has deemed one of its worst terror attacks in recent years. 
Why it matters: Fears had been growing that the situation in Israel and the West Bank could spiral out of control and Blinken's visit was expected to calm tensions. Blinken asked senior State Department officials to remain in the Middle East to help assist with steps that both Israel and the Palestinians have suggested to him ""to lower the temperature.""    Abu Dhabi's IHC to invest $381 million in Adani Enterprises following damaging short seller report  Abu Dhabi's International Holding Company (IHC) on Monday announced that it would invest 1.4 billion dirhams ($381 million) in India's Adani Enterprises' follow-on public offering . The investment comes after the Indian conglomerate's market value plummeted around $70 billion following a damaging short seller report.   Background: This is IHC's first investment of the year, and second investment deal with Adani Group after last year's 7.3 billion dirhams ($2 billion) investment in the group's companies. One of India's largest multinational conglomerates, Adani and its owner Gautam Adani -- one of Asia's richest men -- were caught in the crosshairs of a research firm that accused the conglomerate and Adani himself of pulling off ""the largest con in corporate history."" The report and the selloff it sparked erased some $70 billion in market value across Adani Group companies. Adani said it complied with all local laws and had made the necessary regulatory disclosures. 
Why it matters: The investment deal comes as IHC aims to increase its global acquisitions by 70% in 2023. Abu Dhabi's largest listed company, IHC's market value more than doubled last year. It is chaired by Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the influential UAE national security adviser and a brother of the UAE's president.    Iran, Russia link banking systems amid Western sanction  Iran and Russia have connected their interbank communication and transfer systems to help boost trade and financial transactions, Reuters cited a senior Iranian official as saying on Monday, as both Tehran and Moscow are chafing under Western sanctions. Iran's Central Bank chief Mohammad Farzin welcomed the move. ""The financial channel between Iran and the world is being repaired,"" he tweeted.  Background: Since the 2018 reimposition of US sanctions on Iran after Washington ditched Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, the Islamic Republic has been disconnected from the Belgium-based SWIFT financial messaging service, which is a key international banking access point. Similar limitations have been slapped on some Russian banks since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine last year. 
Why it matters: Since the start of the Ukraine war, Tehran and Moscow have acted to forge close bilateral ties as both capitals attempt to build new economic and diplomatic partnerships elsewhere. With deepening economic misery, many Iranians are feeling the pain of galloping inflation and rising joblessness. Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei said on Monday that the establishment faced ""a tangible welfare and livelihood problem"" that could not be cured without economic growth.  11.4%  The turnout in Tunisia's parliamentary runoff elections on Sunday, Reuters cited the country's electoral commission as saying. President Kais Saied on Monday blamed the low turnout on hatred among voters of the parliament, calling it ""an institution of absurdity and a state within the state."" His critics said the turnout was evidence of public disdain for his agenda and seizure of powers, and opposition parties called for his resignation.  Around the region    Passengers were left disappointed last weekend after spending more than 13 hours in the air on a flight that never landed at its intended destination.  Emirates airline had to return to Dubai on its way to Auckland, New Zealand, on Friday when the destination city's airport closed due to flooding.   The Airbus A380 superjumbo turned back upon reaching west of Indonesia, more than a third of the way to Auckland, a map from flight tracking site Flightradar24 showed.  New Zealand's biggest city has been inundated with record rain. An estimated 240 millimeters of rainfall (9.8 inches) -- equal to an entire summer's worth of rain -- fell on Auckland Friday, making it the city's wettest day on record.  The rain caused widespread travel disruption over the weekend. More than 2,000 people stayed overnight Friday in the airport's terminals due to the flooding, the airport said. Domestic flights resumed Saturday but the international terminal was not operational until Sunday.  Emirates resumed the Auckland route, its longest at 14,200 kilometers (8,800 miles), in December after an almost three-year hiatus due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The flight takes between 16 and 17 hours and is among the world's longest nonstop commercial routes.

"'It's all empty promises': Palestinians feel betrayed by US, warn there's only so much they can bear",2023-02-01,"Abu A'asem brews pot after pot of his specialty Arabic coffee, despite the pouring rain. His corner stand at the heart of Ramallah is always busy, no matter the weather, but his future as a Palestinian is very much as gloomy as the skies above.  ""I am 40 years old and I keep seeing the same thing. Many leaderships have come and gone and the situation remains the same,"" he says.  Despite US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas just a few hilly kilometers away on Tuesday, A'asem says he is sure Palestinians are not a priority for Washington.   ""His visit is only intended for Israel,"" he says. ""It's just good manners to pass by since he is in the neighborhood."" Blinken's visit came in a month that has seen the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli security forces at an eight-year-high. Ten of those deaths occurred because of a raid by Israeli forces in Jenin on Thursday. Tensions quickly spiraled and the next day, a Palestinian man shot and killed seven Israelis outside a synagogue.  Friday night's shooting attack took place in the Israeli settlement of Neve Yaakov, an area Israel considers to be a neighborhood of Jerusalem, but which is deemed illegally occupied land by most of the international community. Blinken sought to lower the temperature, even before he arrived in Israel, while reinforcing the US ironclad commitment to Israeli security. He also said the US, specifically the Biden administration, remains committed to a two-state solution. Speaking alongside Abbas in Ramallah, Blinken said it was necessary first ""to take steps to de-escalate, to stop the violence, to reduce tensions, and to try as well to create the foundation for more positive actions going forward."" But that, he said, was ""not sufficient"" by itself. ""It's also important to continue to strive not only for reducing violence but ensuring that ultimately Israelis and Palestinians alike enjoy the same rights, the same opportunities. What we're seeing now from Palestinians is a shrinking horizon of hope, not an expanding one, and that, too, we believe needs to change."" Yet A'asem is not putting his faith in the United States' top diplomat. ""He might offer us something here and there but it's all empty promises,"" he says. ""Since day one of the occupation it's the same promises and same things and they are failure and empty promises.""  Down the road, the smell of cashews and almonds being roasted at Rifa'at Yousuf's shop cuts through the cold winter air. He too is not optimistic.  ""It's gone from bad to worse,"" Yousuf, 44, says of US policy towards Palestinians.  ""(Blinken's) visit is not welcome for us Palestinians,"" he adds, accusing the secretary of state of enabling Israeli occupation and supporting what he says are Israel's violent actions in the occupied West Bank. ""We, as Palestinian people, we are against any visit from anyone who supports Israel in this way."" Israeli Prime Minister Benajmin Netanyahu vowed this week that Israel would ""strengthen"" settlements in response to the shooting attacks in Jerusalem, a position Blinken cautioned against on Tuesday. But speaking with CNN's Jake Tapper on Tuesday, Netanyahu said people can get ""hung up"" on peace negotiations with the Palestinians, saying he has opted for a different approach.  ""When effectively the Arab-Israeli conflict (comes) to an end, I think we'll circle back to the Palestinians and get a workable peace with the Palestinians,"" he said. Asked what concessions Israel would grant Palestinian territories, Netanyahu responded: ""Well, I'm certainly willing to have them have all the powers that they need to govern themselves. But none of the powers that could threaten (us) and this means that Israel should have the overriding security responsibility."" The disillusionment, hopelessness and the feeling of abandonment is difficult to swallow for most in Ramallah, but it's especially tough for the Palestinian youth, who see no future for their people or themselves.  ""We are very upset,"" 18-year-old Nihad Omar says. ""Every day we see someone become a martyr or a prisoner, it's the same cycle and the numbers just keep increasing, they are not going down."" Analysts on both sides say the Israeli government's promises that it will respond to violence with an ""iron fist,"" coupled with the despair felt by many in Gaza and the West Bank, have turned the region into a powder keg with an ever-shortening fuse. Echoing that feeling, Omar says there's only so much pressure Palestinians can and are willing to bear. ""The occupation is surrounding us from all over and not letting the Palestinian people breathe,"" he says.  Hanan Ashwari, a Palestinian rights advocate and former member of the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization, says the frustration with the United States and Israel felt by those CNN spoke with is valid, and very much widespread through Ramallah and the West Bank.  ""(Blinken) wants to integrate Israel in the region, which means, you know, sideline the Palestinians, reward Israel and normalize the occupation,"" Ashwari says. ""Then they talk about being in favor of two-state solution, they pat themselves on the shoulder and they go home. ""That's very ironic, because they stood aside and they allowed Israel to destroy the two-state solution by destroying the Palestinian state, stealing land, killing people, demolishing homes, and terrorizing, through settlers and the army, the Palestinians,"" she adds.  The disillusionment, Ashwari says, is not just with the United States, but also with the current Palestinian leadership.  ""We have had a leadership that is not just rhetoric but has held on to positions of power and has failed in many ways to deliver to the people even its own policies,"" she explains. ""I think it is time to have elections and to have a new leadership chosen by the people enjoying the legitimacy of the election."" Most we spoke with in Ramallah agree.  ""The Palestinian leadership tries to appease the Palestinian people and bring good, but they are handicapped and incapable of delivering,"" Omar says.  ""The people who are around [current Palestinian Authority President] Mahmoud Abbas are unfortunately more cooperative with the Israelis than him,"" Yousuf says. ""I wish we had someone with the spirit Yasser Arafat had."" But some do still give Abbas and his leadership some credit.  ""The Palestinian leadership tries to bring solutions for the Palestinian people, but they face many challenges,"" coffee-stand owner A'asem says.  Those challenges to a more prosperous Palestinian future, including the establishment of a Palestinian state, they say are roadblocks purposefully put in place by Israeli politicians. For Ashwari, Israeli policies towards Palestinians, now enacted by what is the most right-wing government in the country's history, are slowly but surely destroying the viability of a two-state solution.  ""Israel is making sure there is no viable sovereign Palestinian state by expanding settlements, stealing more land,"" Ashwari says. ""This is unacceptable. The more settlements you build, the less land you have for the Palestinians."" On the streets of Ramallah, Palestinians are acutely aware of that reality.  ""We hope for a two-state solution but what we see on the horizon and what we see on the ground there is nothing to indicate a two-state solution [is viable],"" Yousuf says. ""Palestinians don't have power or opinion or choice, the two-state solution is only words, we aspire for a two-state solution, but this is becoming a dream, an unrealistic dream."" ""There won't be a two-state solution,"" Omar agrees. ""With the Israeli occupiers never."" As he brews another pot of coffee, a pensive A'asem realises the dream of a Palestinian state doesn't seem to be getting any closer.  ""Maybe the two state (solution) has become an unrealistic dream,"" he concedes, seemingly heartbroken by the acknowledgment. But that sense of defeat is only a momentary lapse before a fiery comeback.  ""We Palestinians, we are an emotional people, we are generous, and we will be generous to the Jewish people when they come as guests,"" he says. ""But with an occupier there will never be peace.""

Exclusive: Netanyahu says don't get 'hung up' on peace with Palestinians first,2023-01-31,"Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said people can get ""hung up"" on peace negotiations with the Palestinians, saying he has opted for a different approach in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper on Tuesday. ""When effectively the Arab-Israeli conflict (comes) to an end, I think we'll circle back to the Palestinians and get a workable peace with the Palestinians,"" he said. Asked by Tapper about the Biden administration's concerns that settlements in the occupied West Bank could exacerbate tensions, Netanyahu pointed to the success of the Trump-era Abraham Accords that normalized relations between Israel and several Arab countries. ""I went around them (Palestinians), I went directly to the Arab states and forged with a new concept of peace... I forged four historic peace agreements, the Abraham Accords, which is twice the number of peace agreements that all my predecessors in 70 years got combined."" His comments come at a tense moment for Israel. Palestinians and Israelis have suffered terrible bloodshed in the past week, and fears are growing that the situation will spiral out of control. Last Thursday was the deadliest day for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank in nearly two years, followed by a shooting near a Jerusalem synagogue Friday night -- which Israel has deemed one of its worst terror attacks in recent years. The Biden administration has advocated for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but there has been very little movement and seemingly few active efforts toward that goal by Netanyahu or Palestinian leaders. Analysts say the Abraham Accords have also done little to moderate Israel's position on the Palestinians. When asked what concession Israel would grant Palestinian territories, Netanyahu responded: ""Well, I'm certainly willing to have them have all the powers that they need to govern themselves. But none of the powers that could threaten (us) and this means that Israel should have the overriding security responsibility."" There are hopes that US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's trip to Israel and the West Bank this week would help cool rising tensions. But both administrations appear to be on opposite sides of the coin when it comes to Israeli settlements. Netanyahu vowed this week that Israel would ""strengthen"" settlements in response to shooting attacks in Jerusalem, a position Blinken cautioned against on Tuesday. When asked about US concerns that expanding Israeli settlements on Palestinian land could hamper peace prospects, Netanyahu said: ""Well, I totally disagree."" Complicated relations Biden and Netanyahu have a complicated relationship, especially over Iran. Netanyahu clashed with former US President Barack Obama over negotiations with the Palestinians, then again more openly over the Iran nuclear deal -- which Biden would like to re-enter.  Netanyahu explained his position on Iran to Tapper, saying, ""If you have rogue regimes that are (intending to get) nuclear weapons, you can sign 100 agreements with them, it doesn't help.""  ""I think the only way that you can stop or abstain from getting nuclear weapons is a combination of crippling economic sanctions, but the most important thing, is a credible military threat,"" he said. Iran has said its nuclear program is only for peaceful purposes and that it formally halted its weapons program, but US officials warned Iran's uranium enrichment activities have gone far beyond the parameters of the failed 2015 nuclear deal since former US President Trump exited it. Last week, the International Atomic Energy Agency chief warned that Tehran has amassed enough material for ""several nuclear weapons"" and urged diplomatic efforts to restart to prevent such a scenario. Another point of contention among US allies has been Israel's ambivalent stance on Ukraine. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Israel has been performing a diplomatic balancing act in relations with Moscow. Although it has officially condemned the invasion and regularly sends aid to Ukraine, Israel has yet to send the Ukrainians weapons, and has been criticized for not being more forceful in its criticism of Russia. Israel does not want to upset Russia when the Israeli air force is looking to hit targets across the border in Syria. Israel has launched hundreds of strikes against its neighbor in recent years, mostly aimed at disrupting Iran's supply of precision-guided missile technology to Hezbollah.  Netanyahu referenced this complicated scenario to Tapper, adding that Israel has been ""taking action against certain weapons development"" in Iran. He however refused to confirm or deny whether Israel was behind drone attacks at a military plant in Iran's central city of Isfahan over the weekend.  ""I never talk about specific operations... and every time some explosion takes place in the Middle East, Israel is blamed or given responsibility -- sometimes we are sometimes we're not."" Most right-wing cabinet The wide-ranging interview touched on concerns about Netanyahu's cabinet, described as the most far right and religious in the country's history, which has already faced internal tensions and widespread public protests. Netanyahu's governing coalition relies on the support of a number of nationalist political figures once consigned to the fringes of Israeli politics.  Netanyahu dismissed concerns about the inflammatory rhetoric and actions of these members, saying: ""I've got my two hands on the wheel.""  Pressed on some of those extreme statements -- including reports that Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich described himself as a ""fascist homophobe"" -- Netanyahu said: ""Well, a lot of people say a lot of things when they're not in power. They sort of temper themselves when they get into power. And that's certainly the case here."" Netanyahu accused critics of hypocrisy and not holding a similar lens against his predecessors, while adding: ""Look, I'm controlling the government, and I'm responsible for its policies, and the policies are sensible, and responsible, and continue to be that."" The six-time prime minister also rejected criticism of his government's push for judicial reforms, that would give parliament (and by extension the parties in power) the ability to overturn supreme court rulings, appoint judges, and remove from ministries legal advisers whose legal advice is binding. This comes after he was forced to dismiss key ally Aryeh Deri from his ministerial posts after the High Court ruled that it was unreasonable to appoint the Shas party leader to positions in government due to his criminal convictions. Netanyahu told Tapper that he believed the changes would ""make democracy stronger."" His country has seen ongoing demonstrations against judicial reforms, drawing tens of thousands of Israelis to the streets in January. Meanwhile, Netanyahu continues to face charges on three separate cases in a long-running corruption trial that has dogged him politically. He has repeatedly denied all the charges against him, and has described the trial as a ""witch hunt."" When asked whether there was an truth to claims that Netanyahu was trying to override the judiciary due to his own interests, he said ""that's false. None of the reforms that we're talking about... have anything to do with my trial.""

"Blinken visit reaches new urgency as Israeli, Palestinian tensions boil",2023-01-30,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's trip to Israel and the West Bank may have been in the works for weeks, but it couldn't come at a more pressing time.  Both Palestinians and Israelis have suffered terrible bloodshed in the last few days, and fears are growing that the situation will spiral out of control. Thursday was the deadliest day for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank in nearly two years, followed by a shooting near a Jerusalem synagogue Friday night, which Israel has deemed one of its worst terror attacks in recent years.  Even before the latest flare-up, the trip was expected to be prickly, as Blinken's first visit to Israel since the installation of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government -- widely considered the most far-right and religious in Israeli history.  Now hope hinges on the arrival of the US top diplomat on Monday to help cool the rising temperatures on the ground.   Security coordination crisis  Aside from trying to calm the situation through dialogue, one of Blinken's main priorities will likely be to try to restore crucially important security coordination between Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA).  The PA announced it was severing the coordination on Thursday, following a deadly Israeli military raid in the West Bank which killed 10 people, among them militants and at least one civilian woman, according to both Israeli and Palestinian officials. The US immediately said ending security cooperation was not ""the right step to take at this moment.""  The coordination is seen by many Israeli and American officials as a vital part of maintaining some level of calm, as it involves sharing of intelligence on militant activity, and also links between Israeli and Palestinian security forces. Without that coordination, Israel may not be able to tell Palestinian security forces where and when they will be operating in the West Bank, which could lead to dangerous mistakes or clashes between the two.   But the PA has been under pressure for months to cut off the coordination, often seen by Palestinians as forcing them to do Israel's bidding on occupied territory. It has  taken such steps in the past, in 2020 severing coordination for six months when Israel announced ultimately unfulfilled plans to annex parts of the West Bank, and in 2017 briefly after Israeli police placed metal detectors at the entrances to the Haram Al-Sharif or Noble Sanctuary, known to Jews as Temple Mount, in Jerusalem.  ""This security coordination is both humiliating and ineffective,"" Nour Odeh, a former spokeswoman for the PA, told CNN. ""The PA right now is losing, not just losing control, but losing face. It has no money to pay salaries. It has no control, no ability to protect its citizens, and yet it is expected from the world to protect the occupier and coordinate with them.""  Retired Israeli Col. Michael Milshtein, former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israel Defense Intelligence, said he hopes Blinken will ""leverage or pressure the PA to renew the security coordination,"" adding that it would be even better if the ""Egyptians and the Jordanians put their pressure on (PA  President Mahmoud) Abbas.""  Milshtein said resuming security coordination would not only ""reduce the general tension,"" but send a signal to Palestinian militant groups that rival the PA.  ""It's also going to signal to other organizations, players like (militant groups) Hamas and Islamic Jihad, that there is no vacuum that they can get in and use it to promote their terror attacks. And that the old rules of the game are preserved,"" he said.  But Odeh said pushing the Palestinians back toward coordination ""won't be an easy sell, because that will mean a loss... in the eyes of Palestinians.""  Pressure on Netanyahu  Blinken's first stop is in Israel, where he will meet with Netanyahu and other top Israeli officials.  It's during these meetings, both Milshtein and Odeh said, that Blinken should put the pressure on Netanyahu to resist the more extremist wings of his cabinet, some of whom have called for the dismantling of the PA, while others have called for the death penalty for those Israel accuses of terrorism.  The Israeli government, in response to two shooting attacks in Jerusalem that killed seven civilians and injured five, rolled out a series of measures including plans to demolish the homes of the attackers and drafting legislation to revoke Israeli identity cards and residency of families of those Israel has accused of terrorism, practices critics say are forms of collective punishment proscribed by international law.  ""I know how complex is the current government, it's not easy to promote strategy or promote even negotiations with the Palestinians. But in the end of the day, (Netanyahu) should understand that we're standing between bad and worse alternatives,"" Milshtein said.  Blinken should also demand Israel changes its policies toward the PA, Milshtein said, especially moves that negatively impact the economic health of the territories.  ""I think that right now the PA is in a very fragile and very weak status, every punishment or economic punishment, will actually undermine and damage more the stability of the PA,"" Milshtein said. ""Although the PA causes a lot of problems to Israel... we have much more profits from the existence of the PA than from its vanishing.""  Odeh said Blinken needs to show Netanyahu that Israeli military operations in the West Bank, which have increased over the past year in response to a series of attacks targeting Israelis, are only making things worse. Last year was the deadliest year for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, and for Israelis, in nearly two decades.  ""They can tell this government that this modus operandi doesn't work. You can't keep pushing Palestinians like that. You can't have more than 30 Palestinians killed in less than a month [as has happened in January]. You can't demolish homes -- that will expel families -- and [impose] collective punishment measures,"" Odeh said.  ""It won't be long before Palestinians say, 'You know what, we have to also organize and defend ourselves ... nobody's there to help us. So we're going to do it ourselves.' When you get there, nobody can put a lid on that,"" Odeh said.  Hopes are not high that Blinken's visit will dampen the smoldering embers in Israel and the Palestinian territories, especially as the Ramadan and Passover holidays approach, traditionally a period that has led to clashes in Jerusalem.  ""Right now, the temperature, the atmosphere on the ground is very high. So you need only one spark to really bring a broad explosion,"" Milshtein said.

The digest  Iran summons Ukraine diplomat over comments on drone strike  Iran summoned Ukraine's charge d'affaires in Tehran on Monday over his country's comments on a drone strike on a military factory in the central Iranian province of Isfahan, according to state-backed Press TV. An adviser to Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy linked the incident directly to the war in Ukraine. ""Explosive night in Iran,"" Mykhailo Podolyak tweeted on Sunday. ""Did warn you.""  Background: Iran's Ministry of Defense said that the Saturday attack took place using ""small drones against a defense ministry industrial complex,"" adding that there were no casualties and only ""minor damage was sustained to the roof of the complex."" Russia on Monday condemned the strike and warned against ""provocative"" actions that could trigger an escalation in an already tense situation. Oil prices climbed on Monday. 
Why it matters: Ukraine accuses Iran of supplying hundreds of drones to Russia which are used to attack civilian targets in its cities. Iran has acknowledged sending drones to Russia but says they were sent before Moscow's invasion of Ukraine last year. Moscow denies its forces use Iranian drones in Ukraine, although many have been shot down and recovered there. US media outlets reported that US officials believe the attacks were carried out by Israel. CNN has not independently confirmed that information.    Qatar replaces Russia in three-way consortium exploring Lebanon's offshore energy blocks   Oil companies TotalEnergies and  Eni said Monday that they have transferred a 30% interest to QatarEnergy in two exploration blocks off the coast of Lebanon, Reuters reported, citing TotalEnergies chairman and CEO Patrick Pouyanné. The three-way consortium deal is meant to provide TotalEnergies and Eni with a 35% interest each, with QatarEnergy holding the remaining 30% stake, which until last September belonged to Russia.   Background: Lebanon first signed a consortium with TotalEnergies, Eni and Russia's Novatek to begin exploration in 2017. But in September, Russia pulled out of the deal, leaving its share to the Lebanese government. A month later, Lebanon -- which for years bickered with neighboring Israel over a long-disputed maritime border -- finally signed a US-brokered deal with Israel to demarcate the area in the Mediterranean Sea that is believed to be rich in oil and gas.  
Why it matters: Lebanon hopes that discoveries in the potentially energy-rich blocks would help its shattered economy as well as incentivize future investors to participate.     Top US Treasury official to discuss Russian sanction evasion on trip to Oman, UAE and Turkey  Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian E. Nelson is traveling to Oman, the UAE and Turkey this week, where he plans to discuss Russia's attempts to evade international sanctions amid the Ukraine war, according to a US Treasury statement on Saturday.   Background: The US has been concerned about Russia's attempts to evade sanctions imposed by the US and its international partners since the start of the Ukraine war in February 2022. Two main hubs hosting Russian businessmen have been Turkey and the UAE. Last year, international financial crime watchdog the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) placed the UAE on a ""grey"" money-laundering watch list in an effort to subject its finances to increased monitoring.  
Why it matters: Nelson's trip comes amid strained ties between Turkey and NATO over Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's close ties with Moscow. It also comes as the UAE and other Gulf Arab states expand international partnerships beyond the US.     What's trending  Saudi Arabia: #I_hate_the_niqab  A hashtag decrying the Islamic face veil, or niqab, was trending in Saudi Arabia on Monday, leading to a flood of tweets in defense of the covering.  While ""I hate the niqab"" was trending, few posts were seen supporting the hashtag, with most instead defending the veil. Many, particularly men, called for women to respect Islamic customs. Others saw it as an attack on their faith and called for women to keep away from feminist ideas.

"Settlements to be 'strengthened' in wake of Jerusalem attacks, Israeli PM says",2023-01-29,"Israel will ""take steps to strengthen settlement"" in response to shooting attacks in Jerusalem Friday and Saturday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said. A six-point list to ""fight terrorism and exact a price from terrorists and those who support them"" was posted to Netanyahu's Facebook page overnight Saturday after a meeting of Israel's Security Cabinet. ""In response to the abhorrent attacks and the celebrations in their wake, Prime Minister Netanyahu has decided on steps to strengthen settlement that will be submitted this week,"" the statement reads. It did not provide detail on how settlement would be strengthened. The list also includes more punishments for the families of terrorists. ""The home of the terrorist who carried out the terrorist attack in Jerusalem will be sealed immediately ahead of its demolition,"" reads the first point on the list. The government will revoke national insurance rights and additional benefits for the families of terrorists, and it will submit draft legislation that could revoke their Israeli identity cards and residency, according to the statement. On Friday, seven people were killed and three injured when a gunman attacked a synagogue on the outskirts of Jerusalem.  And on Saturday, a 13-year-old boy allegedly shot and wounded a father and son in East Jerusalem before being ""neutralized"", police said, by two civilians carrying licensed firearms. Israeli police consider both incidents to be terror attacks. In response, the post-meeting statement says that, ""Firearm licensing will be expedited and expanded in order to enable thousands of additional citizens to carry weapons"" and, ""The reinforcement of military and police units, expanded arrests and focused operations to collect illegal weapons will be carried out."" Gunman's family home sealed: police A statement by Israeli police later on Sunday said that the family home of the gunman responsible for the attack near the synagogue had been sealed. ""Tonight, the police forces of the Jerusalem district, fighters of the Border Police, the IDF (Israel Defense Forces), operated in the A-Tor area in East Jerusalem to seal off the house of the terrorist who carried out a shooting attack yesterday evening in Neve Ya'akov, in which seven people were murdered,"" the statement read. ""The terrorist's house was seized on the night of the attack by police and security forces who evacuated its occupants and arrested the terrorist's relatives and family members. Tonight, the sealing of all the openings of the house was carried out,"" it continued. Police previously identified the gunman -- who was killed in a shootout with law enforcement in the aftermath of Friday's attack -- as a 21-year-old resident of East Jerusalem, saying in a statement that he appeared to have acted alone. East Jerusalem is a predominantly Palestinian area of the city. Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Israel will revoke Israeli identity cards for the families of terrorists. The Israeli government will draft legislation to revoke Israeli identity cards.","{'neg': 0.209, 'neu': 0.791, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.4404}",19,26.0,0.19299999999999998,0.7156666666666666,0.09200000000000001,-0.5486333333333334,0.19,0.767,0.043,-0.998,-10.424033333333336,-32.299110000000006,261.0,-0.12375137931034486
"Two wounded in shooting in Jerusalem, police say, after synagogue attack leaves seven dead",2023-01-28,"Two people were wounded in a shooting attack in Jerusalem on Saturday, emergency services say, the day after a gunman killed at least seven people near a synagogue in the city. The two men injured in the City of David area of Jerusalem on Saturday, one aged 22 and one in his 40s, are father and son, according to police. A 13-year-old who police say shot and wounded the pair was ""neutralized and injured"" by ""two passers-by carrying licensed weapons.""  Tensions in Israel and the Palestinian territories remain high after Friday's shooting, which police chief Yaakov Shabtai described as ""one of the worst terror attacks in the past few years."" The shooter in that attack was also later killed by police forces, according to police. ""As a result of the shooting attack, the death of 7 civilians was determined and 3 others were injured with additional degrees of injury,"" police said.  Five of the shooting victims were pronounced dead at the scene, Israel's Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency rescue service said: four men and a woman. Five people were transported to hospitals, where another man and woman were declared dead. Among the wounded is a 15-year-old boy, the MDA said. The attack occurred around 8:15 p.m. local time on Friday, near a synagogue on Neve Yaakov Street, according to a police statement.  Shabtai said the gunman ""started shooting at anyone that was in his way. He got in his car and started a killing spree with a pistol at short range."" He then fled the scene in a vehicle and was killed after a shootout with police forces, police said.  Police identified the gunman as a 21-year-old resident of East Jerusalem, saying in a statement that he appeared to have acted alone. East Jerusalem is a predominantly Palestinian area of the city, which was captured by Israel in 1967. Referring to Saturday's attack, a community leader said the 13-year-old suspected shooter knew a 16-year-old Palestinian who died of gunshot wounds a day earlier. Jawad Siam, director of the Silwanic non-profilt organization in East Jerusalem, told CNN the suspect's family denied their 13-year-old son was responsible for the Saturday attack, which happened close to the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Silwan, East Jerusalem.  According to Siam, the 13-year-old suspect was a neighbor of a 16-year-old Palestinian who died of gunshot wounds in hospital overnight Friday. The 16-year-old was shot Wednesday by Israeli police. Of the two wounded Saturday, the 22-year-old man is now in a serious but stable condition, anesthetized and ventilated in the intensive care unit, while his 47-year-old father is in a moderate and stable condition. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged people against revenge attacks on Friday night. ""I call on the people not to take the law into their own hands. For that purpose we have an army, police and security forces. They act and will act according to the cabinet instructions,"" he said. Meanwhile, the European Union on Saturday urged Israel to only use lethal force as a ""last resort.""  ""The European Union fully recognises Israel's legitimate security concerns, as evidenced by the latest terrorist attacks, but it has to be stressed that lethal force must only be used as a last resort when it is strictly unavoidable in order to protect life,"" the EU's top diplomat Josep Borrell said Saturday in a press release.  Borrell also stressed that the bloc is ""very concerned by the heightened tensions in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory.""  ""We call on both parties to do everything possible to de-escalate the situation and to restart security coordination, which is vital to prevent further acts of violence,"" he concluded.  Friday's incident came one day after the deadliest day for Palestinians in the West Bank in over a year, according to CNN records. On Thursday, Israeli forces killed nine Palestinians and wounded several others in the West Bank city of Jenin, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, prompting the Palestinian Authority to suspend security coordination with Israel. A tenth Palestinian was killed that day in what Israel Police called a ""violent disturbance"" near Jerusalem.  Overnight, on Friday morning local time, Israel launched air strikes on the Gaza strip after rockets were fired towards Israel. Israel's controversial National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir visited the scene of the attack on Friday evening, telling people who were chanting angrily that ""it cannot continue like this."" ""I can tell you, [the people chanting] you are right. The burden is on us. It cannot continue like this,"" Ben Gvir, who also leads the far-right Jewish Power party, said. Some people on the scene were chanting support for Ben Gvir, saying ""You are our voice, we support you."" CNN's Hadas Gold and team, who were also at the scene of Friday night's shooting, heard what sounded like celebratory gunfire and car horns honking from the nearby predominantly Palestinian neighborhood of Beit Hanina. Condemnation around the world The White House condemned the ""heinous terror attack"" at a synagogue in Jerusalem on Friday and said the United States government has extended its ""full support"" to Israel, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.  The US State Department also condemned the ""apparent terrorist attack"" in Jerusalem ""in the strongest terms."" ""This is absolutely horrific,"" said State Department Deputy Spokesperson Vedant Patel. ""Our thoughts, prayers and condolences go out to those killed and injured in this heinous act of violence."" Patel said no change to the schedule of Secretary of State Antony Blinken's upcoming trip to Egypt, Israel and the West Bank was expected. US second gentleman Doug Emhoff joined the Biden administration in denouncing the mass shooting on Friday that killed at least seven people. ""This is a terror attack. This is murder,"" Emhoff said to reporters after touring the Oskar Schindler Enamel Factory in Krakow, Poland.  ""This is something that is horrible. These were people who were just praying in a temple, living their everyday lives, and were murdered in cold blood and it's not acceptable.  Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky added his voice to those condemning the deadly shooting near a synagogue in Jerusalem on Friday, saying that one of those killed in the attack was a Ukrainian national.   ""We share (Israel's) pain after the terrorist attacks in Jerusalem. Among the victims is a (Ukrainian) woman. Sincere condolences to the victims' families. The crimes were cynically committed on the Intl Holocaust Remembrance Day. Terror must have no place in today's world. Neither in (Israel) nor in (Ukraine),"" Zelensky said in a tweet.   Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates called for an end to escalation in tensions.  In a statement released on Saturday, Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs warned ""the situation between Palestinians and Israelis will slide into further serious escalation,"" and the ""Kingdom condemns all targeting of civilians, stressing the need to de-escalate, revive the peace process and end the occupation.""  Egypt's Ministry of Foreign Affairs also warned of the ""severe risks of the ongoing escalation"" between Israel and Palestine, calling for ""provocative measures in order to avoid falling into a vicious circle of violence that worsens the political and humanitarian situations and undermines de-escalation efforts and all chances of reviving the peace process.""  The UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation condemned and rejected ""all forms of violence and terrorism aimed at undermining security and stability in contravention of human values and principles."" Egypt and the UAE have normalized ties with Israel. Saudi Arabia has not.    France, Germany and the UK also condemned the shooting. ""I am appalled by reports of the terrible attack in Neve Yaakov tonight. Attacking worshippers at a synagogue on Erev Shabat is a particularly horrific act of terrorism. The UK stands with Israel,"" Neil Wigan, the British ambassador in Israel wrote on Twitter. The French embassy in Israel tweeted that the incident was ""all the more despicable as it was committed on this day of international remembrance of the Holocaust."" United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres also condemned Friday's deadly attack, his spokesman said. ""It is particularly abhorrent that the attack occurred at a place of worship, and on the very day we commemorated International Holocaust Remembrance Day,"" he said. Guterres also expressed worry ""about the current escalation of violence in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory,"" urging all ""to exercise utmost restraint."" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz offered their condolences to the victims' families following the two attacks. Scholz said Saturday that he was ""deeply shocked"" by the ""terrible"" attacks in Jerusalem in the past 24 hours.   Russia on Saturday urged all parties to show ""maximum restraint"" after the wave of deadly violence. ""We perceive this development of events with deep concern. We call on all parties to exercise maximum restraint and prevent further escalation of tension,"" the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement.

Blinken to visit Israel and West Bank with tensions high after outbreak of violence,2023-01-27,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's trip to Jerusalem and Ramallah next week has gained new urgency after a wave of deadly violence in Israel and the West Bank.  His trip, which also includes a stop in Egypt, was already expected to be complicated, as it will be the top US diplomat's first visit to Israel since the new Israeli government, which includes ultra-nationalists and ultra-religious parties, took power. Now, Blinken is poised to face a rapidly escalating crisis that shows no signs of de-escalation.  At least seven people were killed in a mass shooting at a synagogue in Jerusalem Friday that is being described as a terrorist attack. Israeli police said the gunman, who was killed by police, was a 21-year-old resident of East Jerusalem who appeared to have acted alone. On Thursday, Israeli forces killed nine Palestinians and wounded several others in a raid on a refugee camp in the West Bank city of Jenin. Another Palestinian man was shot dead by Israeli troops later that day in the town of al-Ram, adding to the death toll on what was the deadliest day for Palestinians in the West Bank in over a year, according to CNN records. Then overnight on Friday Israel launched air strikes on Gaza after rockets were fired towards Israel. The Palestinian Authority responded to the Jenin raid by announcing that it will cease security coordination with Israel starting immediately. While US officials have indicated that the days of violence will not upend the top diplomat's trip, the White House on Friday condemned the ""heinous terror attack"" on the synagogue and State Department officials on Thursday expressed concern about the security situation following the Jenin raid.  ""There is the potential for things to worsen in security terms, in terms of protests or any other kind of kinetic action,"" Barbara Leaf, the top State Department official for the region, told reporters on Thursday ahead of the synagogue shooting, adding that the department is in close touch with diplomatic and security personnel on the ground. She also urged the two sides to retain and deepen security coordination. The Biden administration has been careful in its language and sought to publicly avoid criticizing the new government in Israel, which is led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and includes controversial far-right government ministers. Over the past few weeks, US officials have held numerous engagements with the new government -- Blinken's trip follows visits by national security adviser Jake Sullivan and CIA Director Bill Burns. Israel is one of the US's staunchest allies and the importance of the relationship was underlined earlier this week as the two nations launched their largest joint military exercise ever on Monday. Aaron David Miller, who served for two decades at the State Department as an analyst, negotiator and adviser on Middle East issues, told CNN that he has ""never seen an administration engage with a new Israeli Government as frequently and as early and at as senior level as this one."" ""I think their strategy was basically to say, 'OK, you formed this government, your hands are on the wheel. You told us you're in charge, and we're now going to engage with you directly and intensely. Because if things head south, you're the one who's going to have to be responsible with respect to controlling your own ministers,'"" he said. Miller said he predicts the relationship between the two administrations will be publicly non-confrontational, especially as Biden looks to ensure he is seen as pro-Israel ahead of a potential US reelection campaign. The far-right elements of the new Israeli government, meanwhile, have already exacerbated tensions between Israelis and Palestinians. The new national security minister Itamar Ben Gvir has previously been convicted for supporting terrorism and inciting anti-Arab racism. Earlier this year, after being named minister, he visited the Jerusalem compound known as Temple Mount by Jews and the Haram al-Sharif or Noble Sanctuary by Muslims, in a move that drew international condemnation.  Although he visited during open hours for non-Muslims, his visit was seen as controversial because Ben Gvir has publicly called for changes to the delicate status quo agreement that governs the compound.  State Department spokesman Ned Price responded at the time by saying that the US believed the visit has ""the potential to exacerbate tensions and to provoke violence."" Although the Biden administration has advocated for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, there has been very little movement and seemingly few active efforts toward that goal. It is something that Blinken will address during his meetings with Israelis and Palestinians, said Leaf, the State Department official. Miller said he does not expect any progress to be made on this issue during Blinken's visit, which will instead be more of an ""extended condolence call"" due to the synagogue attack in Jerusalem Friday. Jeremy Ben-Ami, the president of the advocacy group J-Street, which pushes for a two-state solution, said that he believes Blinken's trip is well-timed, and sends an important message about American involvement. He said the administration should try to articulate both privately to the new Israeli government as well as publicly the things that the US would find unacceptable, such as ""plans for what amounts to de facto annexation of territory on the West Bank.""","{'neg': 0.362, 'neu': 0.638, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.7783}",30,29.0,0.171,0.787,0.042,-0.5994,0.111,0.813,0.076,-0.9935,-17.982000000000003,-155.71635333333336,233.0,-0.668310529327611
"As Israel bans Palestinian flags, one artist protests with his brush",2023-01-25,"Just over a decade ago, the Palestinian flag hung alongside Israeli and American flags at the Israeli prime minister's residence, when Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas shared a historic handshake.   Today, Netanyahu is back in power and Abbas never left, but many other things have changed, including Israel's attitude toward the Palestinian flag.  This month, new Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir ordered police to take down Palestinian flags in any public place in Israel, claiming they are a rallying symbol for terrorists.  At least one artist felt forced to respond to Ben Gvir's decree.  As soon as he heard about the minister's order, Tel Aviv-based visual artist Michael Rozanov drew himself in the colors of the Palestinian flag and made the artwork his Facebook profile picture.  ""It's ridiculous, you want to take down flags? What if I am a flag, what would you do? Would you put me down because I'm wearing certain colors?"" said Rozanov, known as Mysh. ""So I drew this illustration that took me 10 minutes.""  He didn't expect it to  attract much  attention, but dozens of Israelis joined Mysh, asking him to draw their profile pictures with the Palestinian flag in the hope of making some impact.  ""And then I thought, yeah, it would be nice to offer other people to join in. Because I like drawing and I like starting something online,"" Mysh told CNN .  Naturally, he also drew Ben Gvir clothed in the colors of the Palestinian flag, right up to his kippa, the skullcap worn by religious Jews.   Mysh is far from the only Israeli unhappy with Netanyahu's new government.   The prime minister's right-wing coalition won a slim majority of the popular vote in November's elections, but critics and opponents  object to a wide range of its moves, including the Palestinian flag public ban, increased deference to the ultra-Orthodox and plans to change the judicial system.  More than 100,000 people turned out in Tel Aviv on Saturday night, the latest -- and largest -- in a series of weekly protests against legal reforms Netanyahu's allies are planning.   But not all Israelis welcomed Mysh's drawings.   One commenter on Facebook accused Mysh of ""spreading a flag of hate,"" adding: ""What a bummer.""  Another said: ""What does this want to say? That it is now cool to belong to a nation that has surrendered to its terrorist leaders? Hamas doesn't want peace with us, what's not clear?""  Mysh made a point of replying to each comment to explain and even try to convince his critics.  But he believes that Ben Gvir's attempt to publicly ban the Palestinian flag -- which is technically legal to fly in Israel -- is a continuation of the direction Israel has been moving toward since its founding in 1948.  ""It's definitely a step forward for the craziness, but nothing surprising,"" Mysh said. ""I think what we see now is the shattering of this illusion that most Israelis try to maintain, that they can live in a liberal democracy that respects all human rights, while simultaneously robbing five million people more of the same basic rights,"" he said, referring to the Palestinian population.    An artist who uses different media -- film and animation, illustration and comics -- to address social and political issues, as well as sexuality and gender, Mysh came to Israel as a teenager from Latvia in 1993 and served in its army for three years. But one day doing his reserve service at an Israeli checkpoint in the Jordan Valley, he says he had a powerful insight into the Palestinian experience.  ""The only reason that checkpoint existed was to make the life of the people in the village more difficult,"" Mysh said. ""We were checking the same people twice every day. They were mostly mothers who take their children to kindergarten on the other side of the village.""  ""There was a day when I was standing there with my gun and another soldier was checking ID cards, and suddenly I realized that I am a grown-up man who points a gun at a 3-year-old child. And I say to myself: 'I'm not really pointing at him. I'm just standing like this.' Yeah, but he doesn't know that. What he sees is this scary creature pointing a f**king gun.""  ""It suddenly hit me, the perspective of the other side, which is this child that twice a day sees this monster pointing a gun at him. What are the chances that this child grows up being ready to see me as a human being as I am? How can I expect him to perceive me as a human being? Then I decided I'm out of this. I'm not doing this anymore,"" Mysh said.  Mysh sees a direct connection between Israel's military checkpoints and Ben Gvir's attempt to essentially ban the Palestinian flag, which is likely to be tested in court.  ""Every oppressive system is a weak system because it can't withstand any friction,"" Mysh argued. ""It needs to enforce a huge amount of violence to avoid friction.""  That is what Ben Gvir is trying to achieve, Mysh said: ""It is an idea that in order to achieve our national identity, we need to take it away from other people.""  The digest   NATO negotiations between Sweden, Finland and Turkey delayed -- Finnish FM  Finland's Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto told CNN on Tuesday the country's joint NATO membership bid with Sweden is delayed amid reignited tensions with Turkey. ""Of course, this is not good news,"" he said. The delay follows protests in Stockholm over the weekend that included the burning of a copy of the Quran.   Background: Turkish state broadcaster TRT Haber reported Tuesday that scheduled negotiations between the three nations in February have been postponed upon Ankara's request. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned Sweden on Monday that  it should not expect to receive any support from Turkey for backing the country to join NATO in light of the protests. Haavisto indicated in the CNN interview there are no plans for Finland to proceed with its NATO membership bid without its Nordic neighbor: ""We are not in a hurry, we have time to go together with Sweden,"" he told CNN. 
Why it matters: Turkey's Erdogan has been caught in a spat with his NATO allies over his obstruction of Sweden and Finland's accession to the Western alliance. Turkey has cited the Nordic countries' ""support for terrorist groups,"" mainly Kurdish militant groups, as a key reason for its objection. The recent burning of a Quran in Stockholm, which ignited outrage across the Muslim world, has further strained negotiations, all of which come months ahead of a presidential election in Turkey that Erdogan hopes will allow him to rule into a third decade. Haavisto added he hopes negotiations can resume after the Turkish election in May.    Battle continues over  Beirut port explosion probe    Lebanese judiciary officials clashed on Tuesday over the reopening of an investigation into the 2020 Beirut port explosion. The inquiry was reopened by judge Tarik Bitar on Monday, but was rejected by Attorney General Ghassan Oweidat, who insisted that the investigation remains suspended and that no decision had been taken on whether Bitar could continue investigating.   Background: The inquiry into the blast had been paralyzed for more than a year by political confrontation and complaints filed by top officials who  were sought for questioning. The massive explosion that took place in Beirut's port on August 4, 2020 left more than 200 people dead and thousands injured. The damage was estimated at between $3.8 and $4.6 billion. 
Why it matters: Reopening the investigation may bring hope to countless victims whose lives were uprooted by the deadly blast. Many are still eager to see accountability for the incident.     Israeli PM meets Jordan's king in Amman in first trip abroad since returning to office   Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu on Tuesday held talks with King Abdullah in Jordan. The visit comes amid heightened tensions between the two countries over a Jerusalem site holy to both Muslims and Jews over which Jordan has custodianship in Israeli-occupied East Jerusalem.  Background: Tensions have been high over the flashpoint complex known as Haram al-Sharif to Muslims and Temple Mount to Jews. It contains the al-Aqsa mosque, the third holiest site in Islam, and the site of the destroyed first and second Jewish Temples, the holiest site to Jews. Only Muslims are allowed to pray at the complex under a decades-old agreement. However, Israel's far-right National Security Minister  Ben Gvir, who in a controversial move visited the site two weeks ago, believes that Jews should have the right to pray there too. King Abdullah told CNN in December that Jordan is willing to work with ""anybody and everybody"" in Israel to bring peace, but won't allow ""red lines"" over Jerusalem to be crossed, referring to al-Aqsa mosque. 
Why it matters: This is Netanyahu's first trip abroad since reassuming Israel's premiership last month, and his first visit to Amman and meeting with  Abdullah since June 2018. It comes just two weeks after Ben Gvir's visit to the  site, which drew widespread international condemnation, including from Jordan's Royal Court. After the visit, Abdullah stressed the need for Israel to respect ""the historical and legal status quo"" of the al-Aqsa mosque compound. Palestinians immediately objected to the visit.  What's trending   Regional: Aire   American social media star Kylie Jenner's baby son was trending on Twitter in several Arab countries -- for all the wrong reasons.  Jenner revealed her 11-month-old son's name to the public on Sunday. Arabs swiftly took to social media to poke fun at it. The name, Aire, means penis or 'my penis' in Levantine Arabic, and is often used as profanity.  ""Umm should someone tell Kylie Jenner she renamed her son Aire which is a common Arabic expression for 'my penis' or nah?"" tweeted journalist Antoinette Lattouf to her 13,000 followers.   Even the head of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) weighed in.  ""Arabic speakers are having a field day with this. The Arabic language is full of beautiful words, many of them are used for names,"" Abed A. Ayoub, national executive director of the ADC, tweeted in jest to his 15,000 followers. ""I hope he doesn't have any Arab friends when he's older.""   Jenner, 25, is mother to Aire Webster and 4-year-old Stormie Webster.  This is not the first time such a name made news in Levantine countries, which include Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and the Palestinian territories.   In 2012, Arabic news outlets found themselves in a tough spot when Jean-Marc Ayrault became the prime minister of France. The French pronunciation of his name also means ""his penis"" in Levantine Arabic. Many Arabic outlets chose to pronounce his name with the L, which is meant to be silent.    CNN Arabic similarly decided to transliterate Ayrault's name as it is written, with last two letters, rather than how it's spoken.

Iran's regime is trying to execute its way out of trouble,2023-01-23,"The cries of the women outside a Tehran courthouse swell to a collective wail. The gathering is reminiscent of a vigil, but it is one of the vestiges of a nationwide uprising that has all but died down after the Iranian judiciary's breathless handing down of death sentences in recent weeks.    Children stand at the front of the courthouse protest chanting ""No to execution"" in a January 14 video shared by the Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA). Despite the blurring of faces in the video, one girl can be seen wiping her tears. She appears no older than 10 years.   The nationwide uprising that began in mid-September convulsed Iran, posing the biggest domestic threat to the ruling clerical class in more than a decade.   It penetrated the regime's conservative support base and produced countless acts of defiance -- and sometimes violence -- against the formidable Basij, a voluntary paramilitary group that is the fulcrum of the Islamic Republic's security apparatus. The protesters were young and angry, and a barrier of fear appeared to have broken.  Four months on, the protests have fizzled out amid a growing wave of repression against demonstrators. Four protesters have been executed by the regime; many others fear the same fate. The executions are the culmination of an increasingly violent crackdown including the gunning down of protesters, mass arrests, physical assault and sexual violence.   The regime has also doubled down on the repression of dissidents, ethnic minorities and women. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has chalked the protests up to a foreign conspiracy and has called them an ""act of treason.""   Another factor working against the protesters: most people over the age of 25 have steered clear of the demonstrations, analysts and activists said. This deprived the protest movement of the momentum needed to topple a heavily sanctioned regime over which the international community has little to no remaining leverage.  Still, Iran analysts agree that the regime has kicked the can down the road, and that protests are likely to resurface. Iran's clerical leadership is either unwilling or unable to address its festering economic problems, exacerbated by a US sanctions regime and by widespread corruption.   ""People's anger has increased, not decreased,"" said a 25-year-old activist from the southeast of the country who asked not to be named due to concern for his safety. ""If there were no guns in the hands of security forces, large masses of people would stage an insurrection tomorrow.""   Almost 20,000 people have been arrested according to activists. More than 500, including dozens of children, have been killed, according to HRANA.   The repressive methods have left Iran's protesters in a catch-22 situation. Disgruntlement against the regime appears to be spreading, but its use of brute force has deterred protesters from growing to the level needed to force the regime to stand down.   The absence of a critical mass created a ""mathematical problem"" for the protest movement, said Ali Vaez, International Crisis Group's Director of the Iran Project.   ""The majority will only join in when the regime has lost its will to suppress,"" he told CNN. ""And the regime's will to suppress is unlikely to crack unless there is a critical mass on the streets.""    Vaez compares the state of affairs in Iran to the Soviet Union in the early 1980s, a period of public frustration and dire economic conditions that years later prompted the string of reforms, known as Perestroika, that preceded the USSR's collapse.   ""(The Islamic Republic) is where the Soviet Union was in early 1980s ... It is ideologically bankrupt, is economically in deep trouble and is simply unable to reform itself,"" said Vaez. ""Unlike the Soviet Union in the late 1980s, (Iran) still has the will to fight.""   ""One can conclude that the protests will re-emerge sooner rather than later in a more ferocious manner,"" he added.   The chilling effect of executions    Echoes of the uprising continue to reverberate in the country. Every night in Tehran, , chants of ""death to the dictator"" ring out from rooftops and from behind drawn curtains, out of the sight of security forces. Anti-regime protests continue to crop up in some of the country's minority-dominated border regions which bore the brunt of the regime's crackdown.   On Friday, thousands of people poured into the streets of Baloch-majority Zahedan city after noon prayers, demanding the fall of the regime.   The Kurdish-majority west of the country continues to be peppered by gatherings marking the end of 40-day mourning periods for slain protesters.   ""Kurdistan, Kurdistan, the graveyard of fascists,"" mourners chanted in a video shared by Iranian-Kurdish human rights group Hengaw on January 16. The mourners raised roses in the air to commemorate Hooman Abdullahi, a protester who was shot and killed by security forces.   For activists, the endurance of the protests among ethnic minorities is a sign of what's to come. The executions, they say, will eventually backfire.   At least 18 protesters have been sentenced to death as of now, with only five having won the right to appeal, according to HRNA. More than 100 protesters have been charged with crimes that carry the death penalty.   Four people have been executed already, including high-profile prisoners such as a karate champion and children's coach.   ""People are more angry after we realized how fast and hastily they hanged those men,"" said one activist in Iran who does not want to be identified for security reasons and calls himself Mr. Z. ""I think they compressed the spring more. Next time, people won't even be afraid of being hanged,"" he told CNN.   The executions have drawn sharp condemnation from the international community. Reports, including CNN's own reporting, suggest that most protesters are being denied due process, with speedy trials and access only to state-appointed lawyers.   But the death sentences have also had a chilling effect, mostly on the older generation of Iranians who largely stayed off the street and who are now trying to keep their children at home, activists say.   ""Nobody wants to hold a picture of their kid,"" said one activist outside Iran, referring to mothers carrying photos of their slain and arrested sons and daughters. The images have been ubiquitous since the start of the protests.   ""But the kids want to build their future,"" said the activist, known as Mamlekate, who has played a key role in distributing photos and video from the protests, and in connecting journalists to sources in the country.    ""If the kids don't do it, who's going to do it?"" he told CNN. ""This is far from over.""    The digest    Netanyahu dismisses key ally Aryeh Deri after High Court order Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed key ally Aryeh Deri from all ministerial posts on Sunday, complying with a ruling by Israel's highest court that it was unreasonable to appoint the Shas party leader to positions in government. Netanyahu told Deri he made the move ""with a heavy heart, with great sorrow,"" according to a statement from the Prime Minister's office.   Background: The court had said Deri's appointment ""cannot stand"" due to his criminal convictions and because he had said in court last year before being sentenced over a tax fraud conviction that he would retire from public life. The ruling was a dramatic move amid an unprecedented confrontation between his government and the judiciary.  
Why it matters: Netanyahu's government is planning major judicial reforms, which include a series of changes announced earlier this month that would allow parliament to overturn high court decisions and give politicians more power in appointing judges. More than 100,000 people protested Saturday night in central Tel Aviv, the largest in a series of demonstrations against the planned changes.  Prominent Egyptian businessman and his son released from prison   Safwan Thabet, founder and former CEO of Juhayna Food Industries, and his son Seifeldin Thabet were released from prison in Egypt on Saturday following almost two years in pretrial detention. The businessmen's release comes almost two weeks after a loan agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) called for stronger support for the private sector as one of its key demands.    Background: Safwan was arrested in December 2020, and his son was later summoned and arrested in February 2021. They were both accused of ""belonging to and financing terrorist groups,"" but were never formally charged. The businessmen's case gained international traction over the last two years, and in September 2021 Amnesty International said the incident shows ""just how far the Egyptian authorities are willing to go to exert control and exposes how terrorism-related accusations are ruthlessly exploited in today's Egypt"".  
Why it matters: The listed company Juhayna is Egypt's largest producer of dairy and juice products. In 2021, it had a 58% market share in the milk segment. It is unclear why the two men were released, which comes just two weeks after the IMF released details of its $3 billion Extended Fund Facility to Egypt, in which Egypt pledges to ""reduce the state footprint"" in the private sector.  EU approves new Iran sanctions package, says Iran Guards terrorist designation requires court decision in member state  European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell on Monday said any decision to designate Iran's Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) as a terrorist organization would first require a court decision in a member state.   Background: The European Parliament on Thursday approved a resolution calling on the bloc to designate the IRGC as a terrorist group. And on Monday, the EU approved a new package of sanctions on Iran amid the country's crackdown on protests at home.  
Why it matters: Borrell's statement comes amid conflicting reports from Iranian politicians about potential retaliatory action should the EU move forward with the terrorist designation. The Vice Chairman of the Internal Affairs and Councils Commission in the Iranian parliament, Mohammad Hassan Asfari, on Monday said that shuttering the Strait of Hormuz to European commercial ships is ""on the table,"" according to local media. Shortly afterwards, parliament spokesman Nizamuddin Mousavi said that there is no plan on the parliament's agenda to close down the strait. The strait, which lies off Iran's southern coast, is only 21 miles wide at its narrowest point. One third of the world's seaborne oil passes through it.

US and Israel launch largest military exercise ever despite concerns over Netanyahu's government,2023-01-23,"The US and Israel launched their largest joint military exercise ever on Monday, sending a clear signal to Iran and underscoring the strength of their alliance despite concerns over the composition of the new Israeli government which includes ultra-nationalist and ultra-religious parties.  The live-fire exercise, named Juniper Oak, will include 100 US aircraft with fighters, bombers and refueling aircraft flying alongside 42 Israeli aircraft. The USS George H. W. Bush carrier strike group will also take part in the exercise, which will cover all the domains of warfare to include space and electronic warfare. ""We can't really find another (exercise) that even kind of comes close,"" said a senior US defense official. Nearly 6,500 US personnel will participate in the exercise, as well as more than 1,100 Israeli personnel, the official said. The exercise comes despite concern over the makeup of Israel's new government under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who has appointed ministers once considered to be on the extreme nationalist fringes of Israeli politics including the far-right Otzma Yehudit party and the Noam party, which is opposed to LGBTQ rights. The US official acknowledged the possibility for disagreements with the nascent government but stressed the non-negotiable bipartisan commitment to Israel. ""The security commitment that we have to Israel is irrespective of the particular personalities and particular government,"" the US official said. In December, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Israel's government will be gauged on its ""policies and procedures, rather than individual personalities."" The exercise comes as tensions between the US and Iran remain high. The Biden administration has introduced sanctions on Tehran following a brutal crackdown on protests in the country which have seen protesters executed. Negotiations for a new nuclear agreement have also stalled. Netanyahu has consistently taken a hardline stance towards Iran, vowing upon the swearing in of his new government to ""thwart Iran's effort to obtain nuclear weapons."" As recently as Sunday, Netanyahu said the US and Israel would hold meetings on Iran in the coming weeks, following a visit from US national security adviser Jake Sullivan.  ""I was impressed that there is a genuine and mutual desire to reach understandings on this issue,"" Netanyahu said at the meeting. Exercise came together quickly The exercise, which marks a major increase in cooperation between the US and Israeli militaries, came together quickly, the official said, especially for something of this scale. Normally, such a large exercise involving so many different forces would take a year or more of planning, but his exercise came together in two months, the official said. Planning began under the previous Israeli government of Yair Lapid and finished under the current one.  US Central Command will lead the exercise. Israel was moved to Central Command's area of responsibility in September 2021 following the announcement of the change towards the end of the Trump administration. Despite the shift and the burgeoning ties between Israel and Gulf Arab countries, none of those countries will take part in the exercise. Instead, the US official said they will be briefed on its after its conclusion later in the week.  ""These kinds of exercises -- which CENTCOM routinely conducts with our partners -- develop interoperability between military forces, increase military capabilities and are important to the security and stability of the region,"" said Gen. Michael Erik Kurilla, the commander of US Central Command, in a statement. ""The lessons learned during these exercises are exportable to our partners across the region.""  A previous US-Israel military exercise held in late-November was described by Israel's military, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), as a simulation of a ""long-range operational scenario and long-distance flights,"" including a ""campaign against distant countries,"" a thinly-veiled reference to Iran.  The US official stressed that this exercise was not intended to be a simulation of an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities, but the official acknowledged that Iran would be watching and taking note. ""I do think that this scale of the exercise is relevant to a whole range of scenarios, and Iran may draw certain inferences from that,"" the official said. ""It would not surprise me if Iran, you know, sees the scale and the nature of these activities and understands what the two of us are capable of doing."" Though the Biden administration favored a diplomatic solution to Iran's advancing nuclear program, negotiations over reviving the Iran nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), stalled. Iran's violent crackdown on domestic protests and its provision of suicide drones to Russia's military have made the prospects of reviving the deal even more remote. Israel, which was vehemently against a return to the JCPOA, pushed for a more aggressive US posture toward Iran and has promised to act against Iranian forces in the region. The US has repeatedly promised under Democrat and Republican administrations that Iran will not be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons. ""We would prefer a diplomatic outcome,"" the US official said, ""but we have other capabilities, if required."" The exercise also comes as the Pentagon shifts its focus away from the Middle East and central Asia. The National Defense Strategy identifies China as the challenge of the future, while dealing with the threats posed by Russia. The consequence has been a dramatic decline in the US military footprint in central command. The US has about 35,000 troops in the region now, a far cry from a decade and a half ago when the US had nearly 200,000 troops in Iraq and Afghanistan alone.  But this exercise is intended to show the ability of the US to move large forces into the region in a short period.  ""We still have the excess capacity to be able to flex to another high-priority area of responsibility and conduct an exercise on this scale,"" said the senior US defense official.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",39,32.0,0.01925,0.86525,0.1155,0.364825,0.069,0.849,0.082,0.771,14.228175,-18.80317500000001,277.0,-0.06788149819494589
Netanyahu dismisses key ally Aryeh Deri after High Court order,2023-01-22,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed key ally Aryeh Deri from all ministerial posts on Sunday, complying with an Israeli High Court ruling that it was unreasonable to appoint the Shas party leader to positions in government. The court had said Deri's appointment ""cannot stand"" due to his criminal convictions and because he had said in court last year before being sentenced over a tax fraud conviction that he would retire from public life. Netanyahu told Deri he made the move ""with a heavy heart, with great sorrow,"" according to a statement from the Prime Minister's office. Deri's dismissal came the day after more than 100,000 people protested in central Tel Aviv against Netanyahu's government and its planned judicial reforms, according to police estimates in Israeli media. Thousands more people protested in Jerusalem and other Israeli cities, police said.  This is the third week that opponents of Netanyahu's government took to the streets in protest, but the largest turnout so far. Netanyahu's justice minister Yariv Levin announced a series of judicial reforms earlier this month that would allow parliament to overturn high court decisions and give politicians more power in appointing judges. On Wednesday, the high court ruled that Netanyahu must fire Deri, who was previously convicted on criminal charges including tax offenses. Deri served a suspended sentence and said he would leave public office.  Deri's Shas party -- which won 11 seats in Israel's 120-seat parliament, the Knesset, in November and is a key component of Netanyahu's coalition -- immediately hit back, calling the court decision ""arbitrary and unprecedented."" The Sephardi religious party said the court ""today threw away the voices and votes of 400,000 voters of the Shas movement."" ""Today the court actually ruled that the elections are meaningless. The court's decision is political and tainted,"" the party said. The High Court had been asked to rule on whether it was legally reasonable to appoint Deri to posts in Netanyahu's cabinet despite his tax fraud conviction. Judges ruled that his appointment ""cannot stand."" ""This is, among other things, due to his backlog of criminal convictions,"" and his failure to retire from public life as he said he would do when being sentenced in the tax fraud case. Opposition leaders, including former Prime Minister Yair Lapid and former Defense Minister Benny Gantz, attended Saturday's protest in Tel Aviv. ""What you see here today is a demonstration in favor of the state. People who love the country came to defend its democracy, its courts, the idea of a common life and a common good,"" Lapid tweeted. ""There are Israel lovers here who came to demonstrate for a democratic Jewish state according to the values of the Declaration of Independence. We will not give up until we win.""

Israel's democracy on the brink amid supreme court showdown with Netanyahu,2023-01-20,"Israel's highest court this week ordered Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to fire a key ally, a dramatic move amid an unprecedented confrontation between his government and the judiciary.    The High Court ruled 10-1 on Wednesday that it was unreasonable for Aryeh Deri, leader of the Sephardic ultra-Orthodox party Shas, to serve as a minister. He was appointed interior and health minister just three weeks ahead of the ruling.     But so far, Netanyahu has not taken any action, as political tensions mount. Israel media reported Friday Deri and Netanyahu are in the midst of negotiations over the situation.  Deri has several convictions on his record, most recently on tax charges. Last year he struck a plea bargain with the courts, which saw him serve a suspended sentence after he resigned from parliament and pledged not to return to public office.   Under Israeli law, people convicted of crimes cannot serve as ministers. But Netanyahu's government passed an amendment to that law earlier this month that essentially created a loophole for Deri.   In Wednesday's ruling, the justices narrowly focused on Netanyahu's appointment of Deri despite his assertion he would leave political life as part of the deal for the suspended sentence.      But less than a year after that plea bargain was struck, Netanyahu has now been told he needs to fire Deri -- whose 11 seats in parliament he needs to stay in power.   ""This is a dramatic decision. The decision is aimed at the prime minister, not Deri,"" said Yaniv Roznai, an associate professor and co-director at the Rubinstein Center for Constitutional Challenges, Reichman University in Israel.    Since the ruling, Netanyahu hasn't reacted much beyond going to see Deri and issuing general words of support. CNN has reached out to his office for further comment.  ""When my brother is in distress -- I come to him,"" Netanyahu said as he went to visit Deri after the ruling on Wednesday.     In a joint statement the same day, the heads of the coalition parties led by Netanyahu's party Likud said: ""We will act in any legal way that is available to us and without delay, to correct the injustice and the serious damage caused to the democratic decision and the sovereignty of the people.""  Deri has seemingly vowed to find a way around the ruling, proclaiming: ""They will close the door for us, we will enter through the window. They will close the window for us, we will break through the ceiling.""     But most political and legal experts believe it's extremely unlikely that Netanyahu or Deri would defy the court's ruling, or that Deri will pull his Shas party out of Netanyahu's coalition, a move that would cause the government to fall.    Yonatan Green, executive director of the Israel Law and Liberty Forum, told reporters in a briefing that while he thinks Netanyahu is expected to follow the court order in this case, it sets the stage for future defiance.     ""Each successive case of this kind probably brings us a little bit closer to that particular brink,"" Green said.     And so experts say one of the most likely paths forward is for Netanyahu to fire Deri, and for the government to bulldoze through judicial reforms that it has already announced.       Judicial reform      The Deri ruling comes amid an ongoing battle that has been raging over the judiciary. Netanyahu's justice minister, Yariv Levin, announced in early January a series of judicial reforms that would give parliament (and by extension the parties in power) the ability to overturn supreme court rulings, appoint judges, and remove from ministries legal advisers whose legal advice is binding.      If parliament gets such powers, it could create a path for Deri to return. But critics say it could also help Netanyahu end his ongoing corruption trial. Netanyahu has repeatedly denied in multiple interviews that the changes would be for his own benefit.    Backers of the reforms have long accused the high court of overreach and elitism. They say the changes would restore balance between the branches of government.    But opponents including former Prime Minister Yair Lapid and the President of the Israeli supreme court Esther Hayut say it will erode Israel's independent judiciary, weaken the checks and balances between the branches and spell the beginning of the end of Israel's democracy.    ""If Aryeh Deri is not fired, the Israeli government is breaking the law. A government that does not obey the law is an illegal government,"" Lapid tweeted.    It was these proposed judicial reforms that drove some 80,000 people onto the streets of Tel Aviv in pouring rain on Saturday to protest the changes.     Organizers hope the protest spurs a movement and mounting public pressure on Netanyahu to back off or limit the scope of the proposed reforms.    The digest  UAE and India discussing settling non-oil trade in rupees  The United Arab Emirates is in early discussions with India to trade non-oil commodities in Indian rupees, Reuters cited Emirati Minister for Foreign Trade Thani Al Zeyoudi as saying on Thursday.  Background: The UAE last year signed a wide-ranging free trade agreement with India, which, along with China, is among the biggest trade partners for Gulf Arab oil and gas producers, most of whose currencies are pegged to the US dollar. The large majority of Gulf trade is conducted in US dollars but countries such as India and China are increasingly seeking to pay in local currencies for reasons including lowering transaction costs. 
Why it matters: Other countries, including China, have also raised the issue of settling non-oil trade payments in local currencies, the minister said, but discussions weren't at an advanced stage. China's president in December visited Saudi Arabia where he participated in a Gulf Arab summit and called for oil trade in yuan as Beijing seeks to establish its currency internationally. The Saudi finance minister said this week that the kingdom would be open to trade in other currencies aside from the US dollar.      Turkey's opposition to announce presidential candidate to challenge Erdogan  Turkey's opposition alliance is set to announce in February their presidential candidate to challenge President Tayyip Erdogan's 20-year rule in elections set for May, Reuters cited an opposition party official as saying on Friday. The six-party alliance is seeking to forge a united platform but has yet to agree a candidate to challenge Erdogan for the presidency.  Background: Turkey's two main opposition parties, the secularist CHP and center-right nationalist IYI Party, have allied themselves with four smaller parties under a platform that would seek to dismantle Erdogan's executive presidency in favor of the previous parliamentary system. 
Why it matters: Turkey is heading towards one of the most consequential votes in the century-long history of the modern republic and Erdogan signaled on Wednesday that the presidential and parliament elections would be on May 14, a month ahead of schedule.      Kuwaiti leader frees jailed critics in effort to build political cohesion   Kuwait's Emir Sheikh Nawaf al-Ahmad al-Sabah has pardoned dozens of jailed critics under a new amnesty in an effort to end political feuding that has hampered fiscal reforms as tensions surface between the new government and parliament, Reuters reported. The amnesty pardoned 34 Kuwaitis, most of them convicted for voicing public criticism.   Background: Kuwait has the region's liveliest parliament and tolerates criticism to a degree that is rare among Gulf Arab states, but the emir has the final say in state affairs and criticizing him is a jailable offence. The cabinet on Tuesday voiced hope that the latest amnesty, which followed the pardoning of dozens of political dissidents in 2021 in a nod to opposition demands, would ""create an atmosphere of fruitful cooperation"". 
Why it matters: Opposition members made big gains in elections held in September. Tensions recently resurfaced as lawmakers pressed the government for a debt relief bill under which the state would buy citizens' personal loans -- a measure that past governments have taken but which comes as the oil producer seeks to push through fiscal reforms to bolster state finances.  Around the region  Conservative Gulf Arab states rarely send contestants to international beauty pageants, many of which include segments where women are presented in revealing swimsuits.  But one contestant from the tiny Gulf state of Bahrain avoided that taboo by participating in this year's Miss Universe in New Orleans in a pink burkini swimsuit that covered her from the neck down, including her arms.   As 24-year-old Evlin Khalifa walked down the catwalk, she unfurled a cape with a flag of Bahrain and the word ""equality"" in Arabic. A message in English read: ""Arab women should be represented... A Muslim woman can also become a Miss Universe.""  The pianist and taekwondo black-belt told the UAE's The National newspaper that she decided to participate in order to ""break stereotypes.""   ""Arab women are kind, passionate and brave and they are ready to embrace the challenges of life,"" she said. ""They can become beauty queens in modesty and can shine in modern pageantry.""  The only other Arab country to send a participant was Lebanon. Miss USA won the pageant.

"Jacinda Ardern, like George Washington, knew when to quit",2023-01-20,"""Nothing in his life became him like the leaving it,"" William Shakespeare writes of an executed rebel in ""Macbeth."" Today's leaders, however, often struggle to embrace an equivalent vision of a dignified exit from political life when their time comes.   Jacinda Ardern is the rare leader who is choosing to leave the stage, not to be pushed off it. New Zealand's prime minister said Thursday that she had ""no more in the tank"" after five years in power and would not seek reelection. Unlike leaders who go on too long, who are forced out by rebellious colleagues, rejected by their own parties, turfed out by voters, refusing to admit they lost elections, perennially plotting to return or resort to autocracy to cling onto power, Ardern's stay in power will be enhanced by the leaving of it.   Her self-awareness is on brand for a politician who became a progressive global icon while Donald Trump-style ego populism swept the globe. Her leadership during Covid-19 and after mass shootings at two mosques in 2019 won Ardern admiration far from New Zealand.   A cynic might argue that she simply saw the writing on the wall: Ardern's popularity has ebbed and her Labour Party trails in the polls amid rising crime, high inflation and falling home prices. But there would have been time to mount a comeback before the general election that she called for October.   The price of power for Ardern, 42, has been arduous. She's faced abuse and threats linked to her gender and relative youth.  She has a young daughter and wants to marry her partner; spending time with family isn't just the classic politicians' face-saving excuse here.   For many presidents and prime ministers, the ambition and drive that got them to the top means that they struggle to contemplate voluntarily ceding power. This truism led 20th century British parliamentarian Enoch Powell to note: ""All political lives, unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture, end in failure, because that is the nature of politics and of human affairs.""   In 1987, British PM Margaret Thatcher said she hoped to go ""on and on."" Three years later she was gone, forced out by a revolt in her own Conservative Party after years in power made her regally remote and a growing electoral liability. Some leaders have the mercy of term limits which make the decision for them. US Presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan for instance left their voters wanting more after hitting the two-term maximum. Other presidents suffered the pain of being told to go home, like Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush and Trump who all lost reelection races. Although if you ask the election-denying Trump, he thinks he should now be halfway through his second term, reserving for himself a unique category of post-power political disgrace. The one-term curse also claimed French Presidents Nicolas Sarkozy and Francois Hollande (whose unpopularity toward the end of his term made any reelection dreams unviable.) It's less common now, thankfully, but fate sometimes makes a politician's choices for them. Both Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy were assassinated, and Franklin Roosevelt died of natural causes while in office. Around the world and more recently, North Korea's Kim Jong Il, President John Magufuli of Tanzania and Prime Minister Hamed Bakayoko of Ivory Coast also died of illnesses in office. Then there are the leaders who don't want to go, but are pushed or who are forced out by deteriorating political circumstances. The bloody toll of the Vietnam War and his own tumbling popularity convinced President Lyndon Johnson to tell Americans, ""I shall not seek and I will not accept the nomination of my party as your president"" in a shock announcement in 1968 that continues to help define his legacy. Even some of the strongest leaders can be forced out early by ambitious colleagues pining for their own chance. This happened in Canada early in the century when Finance Minister Paul Martin's long campaign to force Prime Minister Jean Chretien into retirement paid off. But Martin's own premiership was short and troubled and didn't approach his success in his previous job. Exactly the same happened in the UK, when Chancellor Gordon Brown finally elbowed out Tony Blair after his decade in 10 Downing Street in 2007, then struggled as prime minister and lost the 2010 election. His failure paved the way for a long period of Conservative Party rule that still endures. Those Tories by the way have a particular penchant for political regicide before voters get the chance. The three most-recent ex-PMs, Liz Truss, Boris Johnson and Theresa May were all effectively felled by their own party, though Johnson may hope to emulate his hero Winston Churchill in trying to engineer a return to Number 10 after a humiliating political defeat. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meanwhile is proving yet again that comebacks can happen -- but seems perpetually doomed to a thin hold on power. Megalomania and tyranny lie in wait when a leader begins to see themselves as the personification of their nations. Vladimir Putin effectively dismantled the Russian political system in order to wield power for two decades and counting during various terms as president and prime minister. His growing isolation and sense of his own omnipotence now seems to have led him into an unprovoked invasion that has not only devastated Ukraine but has also turned Russia into an international pariah. Chinese leader Xi Jinping just accepted a norm-busting third term -- only for his aura to be tarnished by his mishandling of the pandemic. The world is watching with some concern as Xi becomes more militaristic the longer he stays in power. Ardern has spared herself the indignities of outstaying her welcome or being forced to go by mutinous colleagues. In her resignation speech, she confessed: ""Politicians are human. We give all that we can for as long as we can and then it's time. And for me, it's time."" She might have been channeling an exhausted George Washington, who told Americans in his Farewell Address in 1796 that he hoped that ""whatever partiality may be retained for my services, that in the present circumstances of our country you will not disapprove my determination to retire."" Like Ardern, the first American president understood that in a democracy, the hardest thing is not winning power but knowing when to cede it.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.762, 'pos': 0.238, 'compound': 0.3612}",46,35.0,0.201,0.799,0.0,-0.7783,0.128,0.77,0.102,-0.9889,-35.8018,16.98736083333332,243.0,0.06990683470507539
"Key Netanyahu ally cannot serve as cabinet minister, Israel's top court rules, sparking potential political crisis",2023-01-18,"Israel's top court ruled 10-1 on Wednesday that Aryeh Deri, leader of the Shas party and a key ally of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, should not be allowed to serve as a cabinet minister because of a February 2022 conviction for tax fraud. Netanyahu should remove Deri from his post, the court ruling said. Such a move would risk plunging the country into a political crisis. Deri's Shas party -- which won 11 seats in Israel's 120-seat parliament, the Knesset, in November and is a key component of Netanyahu's coalition -- immediately hit back, calling the court decision ""arbitrary and unprecedented."" The Sephardi religious party said the court ""today threw away the voices and votes of 400,000 voters of the Shas movement."" ""Today the court actually ruled that the elections are meaningless. The court's decision is political and tainted,"" the party said. The High Court had been asked to rule on whether it was legally reasonable to appoint Deri to posts in Netanyahu's cabinet despite his tax fraud conviction Judges ruled that his appointment ""cannot stand."" ""This is, among other things, due to his backlog of criminal convictions,"" and his failure to retire from public life as he said he would do when being sentenced in the tax fraud case. The underlying legal issue is whether Deri's tax fraud conviction constitutes a crime of moral turpitude. Until November's elections, that would have disqualified him from serving in government. But Netanyahu and his allies made a change to the law in the wake of their election victory, clearing the way for Deri to become a minister. Deri was a member of the Knesset at the time of his tax fraud conviction last year.  He resigned as a lawmaker rather than giving the head of the election commission a chance to rule on whether the conviction disqualified him from serving as a minister. This means that the legal question of whether Deri's fraud conviction counts as a crime of moral turpitude remains unresolved. Deri allies have been signaling this week that the Shas party leader would not resign his ministerial post even if the court ruling went against him. In a statement made to his fellow party members gathered at his house, Deri on Wednesday said he would ""continue the revolution even more strongly with and more force,"" without going into detail. His refusal to resign -- or Netanyahu's refusal to sack him -- potentially sets up a constitutional crisis pitting the government against the High Court. Netanyahu and his coalition partners have 64 seats in the 120-seat Knesset, a majority of four. Deri's Shas party holds 11 of those 64 seats, so dismissing Deri would plunge the government into crisis. On Wednesday evening local time Netanyahu was seen visiting Deri's home, spending around 45 minutes inside before leaving again. Netanyahu did not make any comment to journalists who were outside. Justice Minister Yariv Levin -- a member of Netanyahu's Likud party -- vowed to intervene on Deri's behalf. ""I will do everything necessary so that the crying injustice done to Rabbi Aryeh Deri, to the Shas movement and to Israeli democracy will be fully corrected,"" Levin said. Levin has already announced plans to change Israel's justice system by giving the Knesset the power to overrule Supreme Court decisions and to review nominations to the court. The President of the Supreme Court, Esther Hayut -- who was among the 10 judges ruling Wednesday that Netanyahu should dismiss Deri -- last week called the proposed changes ""an unbridled attack on the legal system.""   Political instability continues Israel has been racked by political instability in recent years, with Netanyahu winning a slim victory in the fifth Israeli election in less than four years in November. Netanyahu, who was sworn in as prime minister for the sixth time in his career at the end of December, has remained a dominant figure during a period of protracted political chaos. His latest government is likely to be the most right-wing in Israel's history.  Itamar Ben Gvir, an extremist who has been convicted for supporting terrorism and inciting anti-Arab racism, became national security minister. Bezalel Smotrich, who has supported abolishing the Palestinian Authority and annexing the West Bank, became finance minister. Netanyahu's latest term has got off to a tough start, with tens of thousands of people protesting in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem on January 14 against his government's proposed changes to the Israeli judicial system. Attendees held signs comparing Netanyahu to Russian President Vladimir Putin, and saying Israel was turning into the likes of semi-democratic Hungary and theocratic Iran. Protesters told CNN they came out of fear for Israel's future and to send a message to Netanyahu that the public wouldn't stand for what they see as the dismantling of Israeli democracy.","{'neg': 0.206, 'neu': 0.704, 'pos': 0.09, 'compound': -0.5106}",34,36.0,0.0476875,0.8888125,0.0635,0.06101818181818182,0.112,0.792,0.096,-0.968,2.074618181818182,-13.283620984848497,201.0,-0.06608766659128605
US has moved munitions stored in Israel for use by Ukraine,2023-01-18,"The United States has transferred American munitions stored in Israel for use in Ukraine and plans to send more soon, US and Israeli officials told CNN Wednesday. A US official told CNN they have moved ""some"" of the 300,000 155-millimeter shells that the US and Israel agreed would be transferred, and that there are plans to move the remaining amount in the coming weeks. Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Richard Hecht told CNN that the Americans notified the Israelis a while ago they were transferring munitions. Hecht said the munitions are US-owned, that their movements are ""American business"" and that they don't need Israeli permission to move the munitions. ""In support of security assistance packages to Ukraine via the Presidential Drawdown Authority, the DOD has been able to transfer materiel and equipment while maintaining military readiness. Due to operational security considerations, we will not discuss the location or units providing the equipment or materiel,"" Pentagon spokesman Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder said in a statement. ""As we provide aid to Ukraine, we are also working to replenish US inventories and backfill depleted stocks of allies and partners."" The New York Times first reported the American military is tapping into its munitions stockpile stored in Israel for use in Ukraine, noting Israeli officials had initially expressed ""concerns about appearing complicit in arming Ukraine."" Israel has been walking a fine diplomatic line during Russia's invasion of Ukraine. While Israeli leaders have condemned the invasion, supported Ukraine in the United Nations, sent humanitarian aid and taken in refugees, Israel has drawn a hard line at sending military aid, citing its own security sensitivities. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said before he took office at the end of December that he would review Israel's policy on Russia's war in Ukraine.    The strain on weapons stockpiles -- and the ability of the US industrial base to keep up with demand -- is one of the key challenges facing the Biden administration as the US continues to send billions of dollars of weapons to Ukraine to support its fight against Russia. CNN previously reported a US official said the stockpiles of certain systems are ""dwindling"" after months of sending supplies to Kyiv during the high-intensity war, as there's ""finite amount"" of excess stocks which the US has available to send. CNN reported in November that the US intended to buy 100,000 rounds of artillery ammunition from South Korean arms manufacturers to provide to Ukraine as part of a broader effort to find available weaponry for the high-intensity battles unfolding in Ukraine.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",15,37.0,0.14,0.86,0.0,-0.5994,0.061,0.861,0.077,0.4939,-8.991000000000001,-36.5027959848485,177.0,-0.2062304857901045
A major oil exporter is hosting a UN climate summit. Opinions are divided,2023-01-16,"This year's COP28 climate summit is mired in controversy, held in one of the world's biggest oil exporting nations -- the United Arab Emirates -- and headed by one of the most prominent faces in its oil industry.  Environmental activists have cried foul, arguing that the climate debate has been hijacked by the fossil fuel lobby to protect the profit-maximizing agendas of petrostates.   The UAE's involvement has sparked a discussion  on whether there's a place in the climate space for countries that rely primarily on fossil fuel exports for their income. And opinions are split.  Sultan Al Jaber, who will preside over the November summit, wears two very prominent hats in the UAE. Aside from being the CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), he is also the UAE's climate envoy, tasked with spearheading its energy policy. He took on the climate portfolio over a decade before becoming a top oil executive, helping launch the state's clean energy company Masdar in 2006 and bringing the International Renewable Energy Agency's headquarters to Abu Dhabi in 2009.  The message the UAE is sending is that both fossil fuels and renewable energy must be part of the global energy mix, and that one does not have to replace the other.  It has argued that given the projected growth in global energy demand, both clean and dirty energy will be needed to power the world, and a hasty transition away from oil and gas could have a detrimental effect on the global economy.  ""Recent events have shown that unplugging the current energy system before we have built a sufficiently robust alternative puts both economic and climate progress at risk -- and calls into question whether we can ensure a just transition that is equitable to all,"" Al Jaber wrote last year in an opinion piece for Project Syndicate.  The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates a nearly 50% increase in global energy use by 2050, with oil and gas remaining the most-consumed sources of energy.   Tom Evans, a policy adviser at the European climate change think tank E3G, told CNN that Al Jaber's appointment raises questions about the credibility of the UAE's COP28 presidency. ""At face value, the head of a national oil company is obviously facing a massive conflict of interest,"" he said.  Al Jaber's dual roles are what make him a ""terrific choice,"" US Climate Envoy John Kerry was cited as saying by the Associated Press on Monday. The company he leads ""knows it needs to transition,"" Kerry  said.   Simon Stiell, the executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on Monday called the UAE's hosting of the summit a ""unique opportunity"" at an environmental summit in Abu Dhabi. The UAE has the expertise ""to get every sector, particularly those hard to abate, aligned with 1.5,"" he said, referring to the climate goal to stay below 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming.  The UAE has touted the mantra of ""maximum energy, minimum emissions,"" saying that instead of phasing out fossil fuels, it will work on making their extraction cleaner, and reinvest its revenues into renewable energy in an effort to raise its share of the nation's energy mix. The country is future-proofing its energy sector and will ""celebrate"" the last barrel of oil it exports, Al Jaber said at an energy summit in Abu Dhabi on Saturday.  Over the past 15 years, the UAE has invested $40 billion in renewable energy and clean technology globally, according to the Atlantic Council think tank. Last year, it entered a pact with the United States to invest another $100 billion in clean energy. Al Jaber on Saturday called for a tripling of renewable energy output around the world and twice as much money for adaptation in the global south.  But that's not enough, climate experts say.   ""Fossil fuel profits are most certainly not powering investments in clean energy,"" Assaad Razzouk, a clean energy analyst in Singapore, told CNN. ""Just look at the spending of oil and gas companies and how that's allocated,"" Razzouk said. Companies like ADNOC and Saudi Arabia's Aramco oil company need to stop investing in oil and gas and spend much more on renewables if they are serious about the transition to clean energy, he added.  Global campaigner Corporate Accountability in November described the presence of oil lobbyists at climate summits as ""a rise in the influence of the fossil fuel industry at the climate talks that are already rife with accusations of civil society censorship and corporate influence.""  Climate experts say the UAE's approach of expanding the use of renewables while continuing to extract fossil fuels defies its own commitments. COP28 didn't respond to CNN's request for comment.  ""The Glasgow Climate Pact agreed at COP26 in 2021 by all countries, including the UAE, calls for a cut of 45% in carbon emissions by 2030,"" Mark Maslin, a professor working on climate change at University College London, told CNN. ""This can only be achieved if there is no new investment in fossil fuels and the use of all fossil fuels is phased out as soon as possible.""   ""So it does not make any sense to invest in fossil fuels when the world needs to be net zero emissions before 2050,"" he added.  But the UAE is doing quite the opposite.   One of the few producers in the OPEC oil cartel with the capacity to ramp up production on short notice, the UAE  has repeatedly called for more investment in the oil sector to meet global demand, and has embarked on a project to further increase its own capacity. In November, it brought forward its oil production expansion to 2027 instead of 2030, when it will be producing up to 5 million barrels per day (bpd) from about 4 million.  The UAE's approach has been pragmatic, said Amena Bakr, chief OPEC correspondent at Energy Intelligence, adding that Russia's war on Ukraine led nations to prioritize energy security and realize that the world couldn't do away with oil and gas so soon.  ""Renewable energy still cannot meet base-load energy demand -- that's a fact,"" she told CNN.   For Razzouk, the clean energy analyst, the conflict has ""incontrovertibly shown the folly of relying on imported fossil fuels, and the national security risks this entailed.""   The digest  Iran hangs British citizen on charges of espionage and corruption  A dual British-Iranian citizen was hanged by Iran on charges of espionage and corruption, a state-affiliated media outlet reported Saturday, the latest in a string of executions carried out by a regime grappling with unprecedented protests across the country. Alireza Akbari was executed for crimes including ""corruption on earth,"" according to the Iranian judiciary-affiliated outlet Mizan. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he was ""appalled by the execution."" Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said Saturday afternoon that the British government planned to sanction Iran's Prosecutor General to underline ""our disgust at Alireza Akbari's execution.""  Background: Akbari previously served as Iran's deputy defense minister and was the head of the Strategic Research Institute. He was charged with working as a spy for MI6, the British intelligence agency, and reportedly paid more than $2 million, Iranian state media reported Saturday. He allegedly provided information to foreign officials about 178 Iranian figures, including the country's chief nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, who was killed by a remote-controlled machine gun operating out of a car in 2020. Iran's top officials accused Israel of masterminding the plot at the time, without providing evidence. 
Why it matters: Though Iran does not recognize dual nationality, the execution of an individual holding British citizenship will likely further fuel tensions between Tehran and Western nations, which have been critical of the regime's response to anti-government demonstrations that began in September last year. Iran has long ranked among the world's top executioners, and Akbari is one of three individuals to receive a death sentence in the first weeks of 2023.    More than 80,000 turn out for Tel Aviv protest against Netanyahu government    Despite pouring rain, tens of thousands of people protested in Tel Aviv Saturday night against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government's proposed changes to the judicial system. Others took to the streets in Jerusalem for parallel protests. Attendees held signs comparing Netanyahu to Russian President Vladimir Putin, and saying Israel was turning into the likes of semi-democratic Hungary and theocratic Iran.   Background: The proposed changes, announced last week by Israeli Justice Minister Yariv Levin, would seek to reform Supreme Court nominations via a review committee and enable parliament to overturn Supreme Court rulings.   
Why it matters: Protesters told CNN they fear for Israel's future and that they came out to send a message to Netanyahu that the public wouldn't stand for what they see as the dismantling of Israeli democracy. Esther Hayut, the president of Israel's Supreme Court, on Thursday attacked the proposed changes as ""an unbridled attack on the legal system"" and said they were ""designed to force a fatal blow on the independence of the judicial system.""      Syria sets conditions for rapprochement with Turkey  Syrian foreign minister Faisal Mekdad said on Saturday that Turkey would have to end its military presence in his country to achieve a full rapprochement, Reuters reported. ""We cannot talk about resuming normal ties with Turkey without removing the occupation, without ending terrorism and returning the relations to the state that they were based on the first place,"" he said after meeting his Iranian counterpart in Damascus.  Background: Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Thursday that he could meet his Syrian counterpart early in February. Syria has made no official comment on the timing of any such meeting, which would mark the highest-level talks between Ankara and Damascus since the Syrian war began in 2011. 
Why it matters: Turkey has been a major backer of the political and armed opposition to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad during the 12-year conflict in Syria, and has sent its own troops into swathes of the country's north.  But Ankara may be seeking a green light from the Syrian regime and its Russian ally to launch a military operation against Kurdish groups in northern Syria.  $30 billion   The UAE will invest $30 billion in South Korea, Reuters cited South Korea's presidential office as saying on Sunday.

"More than 80,000 people turn out for Tel Aviv protest against Netanyahu government",2023-01-14,"Tens of thousands of people protested in Tel Aviv Saturday night against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government's proposed changes to the Israeli judicial system.   Despite pouring rain over the city, police estimated that more than 80,000 people flooded central Tel Aviv's HaBima square and surrounding streets, according to Israeli media, while others took to the streets in Jerusalem for parallel protests.   Attendees held signs comparing Netanyahu to Russian President Vladimir Putin, and saying Israel was turning into the likes of semi-democratic Hungary and theocratic Iran.  Protesters told CNN they came out of fear for Israel's future and to send a message to Netanyahu that the public wouldn't stand for what they see as the dismantling of Israeli democracy.    Esther Hayut, the president of Israel's Supreme Court, on Thursday attacked the proposed changes as ""an unbridled attack on the legal system"" and said they were ""designed to force a fatal blow on the independence of the judicial system.""   The proposed reforms, announced last week by Israeli Justice Minister Yariv Levin, would seek to reform Supreme Court nominations via a review committee, and enable parliament to overturn Supreme Court rulings.

Opinion: Don't expect Biden to confront Netanyahu anytime soon,2023-01-04,"Barely a week into the most extreme government in Israel's history, its controversial national security minister, Itamar Ben Gvir, is already demonstrating its right-wing religious and nationalist credentials.   On Tuesday, Ben Gvir visited the Jerusalem compound known as the Temple Mount by Jews and the Haram al-Sharif by Muslims -- an action that threatens to upset an already precarious status quo and trigger violence.  Ben Gvir, who has previously been convicted of racist incitement, has vowed to institutionalize Jewish prayer and presence in perhaps the most volatile flashpoint in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. His stated intention for the visit was to mark one of the Jewish fast days.  The visit prompted a string of international condemnations, including from the US Embassy in Jerusalem, which indicated in a short statement that such actions were ""unacceptable.""  Ben Gvir -- a long time provocateur and heir to the party of the extremist Rabbi Meir Kahane -- is now in charge of Israel's police, putting him in an influential position to stir up trouble in Jerusalem and between Israel's Arab and Jewish citizens. But if you think the Biden administration is gearing up for a sustained campaign to aggressively oppose the direction the new Netanyahu government is heading, you should lay down and wait quietly until the feeling passes.  Governing is about choosing. And while a fight might yet come, US President Joe Biden will go to great lengths to avoid a confrontation with a newly elected Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Here's five reasons why.   First, Biden is preternaturally pro-Israel.  The US President may have once told Netanyahu: ""Bibi, I don't agree with a damn thing you say, but I love you."" But it's not the Prime Minister with whom he's enthralled, it's the state of Israel.  Biden's commitment to Israel stretches back decades. He's long been captivated by the idea of Israel and has a deep appreciation and respect for the realities of Israel's security challenges. If you're looking for a presidential model when it comes to handling Israel, it's not Biden's former boss Barack Obama that comes to mind but former President Bill Clinton. As fellow politicians, their affection for Israel and the importance of supporting Israel politically run deep. As far as Netanyahu is concerned, Biden knows all too well the Prime Minister's strengths and limitations. After the humiliation of a Netanyahu government decision to announce a major expansion of housing in East Jerusalem during his visit as Vice President in 2010, Biden clearly doesn't trust him.   At the same time, he knows that Netanyahu -- for better or worse -- is a political survivor and an immensely talented politician who's been a part of Israel's story for decades.  Biden believes -- perhaps mistakenly -- that if he wants to have any chance of getting anything done in the region, he must find a way to deal with him. Like Clinton, his first instinct is not to jam Netanyahu but to give him the benefit of the doubt and try to work things out quietly without a public row.  Indeed, it's no coincidence that in congratulating Netanyahu on his new government, Biden referred to the fact they've been friends for decades.    Second, Biden is too busy.  Fighting with Israel requires presidential time and energy. Biden's foreign policy plate is already brimming with problems that lack quick or easy solutions. The administration's top foreign policy priorities are the Russian war against Ukraine and how to deal with China. And then there are the nuclear threats from both North Korea and Iran. These are the challenges that will define his presidency far more than the Middle East, which the administration has rightly deprioritized. In that region, filled with political and security landmines, the focus is on managing -- not resolving. And trying to keep as many issues off the President's plate as possible.   Biden got a taste of the risks during his ill-fated ""fist-bump"" trip to Saudi Arabia in July last year. He gave Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman what he wanted -- recognition. And in return, he essentially got a slap in the face. With gas prices rising, two weeks before the midterms, the Saudi-Russia dominated OPEC+ cartel cut production significantly.   Third, Biden knows fighting with Israel is bad politics.   Republicans control the House and trail the Democrats by a hair in the Senate. The race for the White House won't formally conclude until 2024; but it begins this year. Whether Biden runs or not, the Israel issue is always loaded politically -- for whoever does run.  With the exception of a few outliers like Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, the Republican Party has set itself up as the go-to party on Israel. And given Netanyahu's honorary membership in the GOP, it should surprise no one if he finds a way, as he did during the Obama administration, to cavort with the Republicans.  If Donald Trump is the Republican nominee, there's no doubt they'll figure out ways to cavort with one another. The last thing Biden or any Democratic nominee needs is to get sandwiched between the Republicans beating him up for fighting with Israel, and a Democratic Party divided between a majority who are traditional Israeli supporters and a progressive minority pushing the administration to hold Israel accountable for its treatment of the Palestinians.  In the event the Iran nuclear deal surfaces again (even the Israelis believe it's not dead yet) Biden would get caught between Republicans and more than a few Democrats who will vigorously oppose US reentry -- and an Israeli Prime Minister egging them on, if not leading the band.    Fourth, Biden knows the Palestinian issue isn't ready for prime time. Presidents don't willingly seek out fights with a close ally, even one where US interests and values may be beginning to diverge on some important issues. And fighting with Israel on the Palestinian issue, which shows little promise of producing results, is unlikely to provide Biden with much of an incentive.  The two-state solution, if not dead and going the way of the dodo, still faces unimaginable long odds. The best Biden can possibly hope to achieve is to prevent an explosion between Israelis and Palestinians of tensions. That involves holding the line against de jure annexation by Israel; preempting another escalatory round like May 2021 between Israel and Hamas and keeping the Abraham Accord countries from jumping ship if there's a sustained confrontation between Israel and the Palestinians.  The key ingredient required for anything remotely resembling a credible negotiating process are leaders on each side who are willing and able to make key decisions and bring their constituencies along with them. These simply do not exist now.    Fifth, Biden believes Iran is the greater priority.   The Palestinian issue is volatile. But the real crisis for Biden isn't over a two-state solution but how to contain Iran's nuclear program. That issue could lead to regional confrontation, rising oil prices and plunging financial markets. And right now, it appears that there's little prospect of a return to the nuclear accord even while Iran ramps up uranium enrichment to near weapons-grade. Biden knows that Netanyahu's threshold for taking military action against Iran is much lower than America's. And the US President is going to try to coordinate with Netanyahu on Iran, rather than push him into a corner, in the hopes of finding some way to deter Iran without the use of military force.  What Biden is unlikely to do is to put himself in a situation where he and Netanyahu are in conflict on both Iran and the Palestinians. Biden had a ringside seat watching his former boss Obama go at it with Netanyahu on both; and probably doesn't want to go down that road again.  There are reports that the administration is sending National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan to Israel this month. That suggests Biden wants to get ahead of any kind of confrontation with Netanyahu and perhaps believes he can work out understandings on some key issues.  Netanyahu isn't looking for a fight with Biden. Right now he's more beholden to his extremist coalition than he is to Washington. Without those partners, Netanyahu can't pass the legislation he needs to postpone or nullify his corruption trial. Perhaps he believes he can control his extremist ministers. And that's the case he'll make to the administration -- that he needs help in doing so.  Paradoxically, tough statements from Washington might actually help Netanyahu do so. But the administration should also understand that words alone aren't enough, particularly if the views of Netanyahu's extremist coalition partners turn into actions.  Without imposing consequences for provocative Israeli actions in Jerusalem and the West Bank, and working to press Palestinians to control terror and violence, Biden will likely -- before his first term is up -- have yet another crisis to add to an already full plate.","{'neg': 0.175, 'neu': 0.825, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.1779}",71,40.0,0.08572222222222224,0.8039444444444446,0.11033333333333334,0.06709444444444444,0.096,0.788,0.116,0.9865,4.763705555555555,-19.605476262626276,186.0,-0.10540578635820579
Israel's rightward shift leaves its new Arab allies in an awkward spot,2023-01-04,"It was a rare embrace between one of Israel's most controversial politicians and an Arab ambassador. Itamar Ben Gvir and the United Arab Emirates' Ambassador to Israel Mohamed Al Khaja clutched each other's hands in a warm greeting in Tel Aviv in early December.    ""Birds of a feather flock together,"" wrote a columnist in Israel's left-leaning Haaretz newspaper, arguing that the Abraham Accords, which saw Israel gain recognition from four Arab states including the UAE in 2020, did little to moderate Israel's position on the Palestinians. Ben Gvir, he said, was ""a superstar in the UAE.""    Israel on Thursday swore in what is likely to be the most right-wing government in its history, led by six-time Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Ben Gvir, an extremist who has been convicted for supporting terrorism and inciting anti-Arab racism, became national security minister. Bezalel Smotrich, who supports abolishing the Palestinian Authority and annexing the West Bank, became finance minister.    Both politicians were invited to national day celebrations in December hosted by the UAE and Bahrain, which were among the nations that normalized relations with Israel, along with Morocco and Sudan in 2020.     ""The Emirates are here to show that unity equals prosperity,"" Al Khaja was cited by the Times of Israel as saying at his country's national day celebration, where he was photographed with Ben Gvir. ""We will continue to use diplomacy to deepen connections through friendship and mutual respect.""    The public embrace of figures that are hated in the Arab world -- and are divisive within Israel itself -- is a rare gesture on the part of Arab states that have normalized relations with Israel.     Egypt and Jordan, who recognized Israel in 1979 and 1994 respectively, have had what observers have called a ""cold peace"" with Israel.    In his phone call to congratulate Netanyahu on returning as prime minister, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi ""emphasized the need to avoid any measures that would lead to tension and complicate the regional situation."" Jordan's King Abdullah II warned in a CNN interview last month that his nation was ""prepared"" for conflict should the situation change at Jerusalem's al-Aqsa mosque, of which he is the custodian.    The rightward direction of Israeli politics puts Israel's new Arab partners in an awkward position regarding the Palestinian cause, which remains a central issue among Arab publics.     ""It is awkward not just for us (in the UAE), but for everybody, in America, and all over the place,"" Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a political science professor in the UAE, told CNN. ""It is a dilemma, but the way to deal with it is just to wait and see.""    An opinion poll by The Washington Institute for Near East Policy in July 2022 showed that support for the Abraham Accords had dropped in Gulf countries to a minority view, including the UAE and Bahrain, where more than 70% of the public views the agreement negatively. The data however also showed that around 40% of people in Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain support maintaining business and sporting ties with Israel.    The normalizing states appear to be cognizant of that. On Friday, all four Arab states continued the tradition of supporting the Palestinians at the United Nations by voting at the General Assembly to seek the International Criminal Court's opinion on the legal consequences of Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories. Netanyahu called the vote ""despicable.""    But Israeli media has reported that behind the scenes, the Emiratis have also been sending messages of concern to Netanyahu about the inclusion of extremists in his government. Ahead of the Israeli elections, UAE Foreign Minister Abdullah Bin Zayed warned Netanyahu against including Ben Gvir and Smotrich in his government, the Times of Israel reported, citing a senior official. Axios, which first reported the news, said Netanyahu didn't respond.    The move would be a rare case of one of Israel's Arab partners showing a preference for the country's domestic politics.     The UAE foreign ministry didn't respond to CNN's request for comment.  Israeli analyst Zvi Bar'el wrote in Haaretz that the December move to embrace Ben Gvir may have been linked to Abu Dhabi's desire to steer Israeli policy, adding that it made the UAE ""the Arab country with the greatest influence on the new Israeli government.""    The effectiveness of the UAE's diplomacy within Israel remains to be seen. So far, Israel's extremist minister seems unrestrained.    Less than a week since he was sworn in, Ben Gvir made a controversial visit to the al-Aqsa mosque compound escorted by Israeli police on Tuesday. The mosque, which lies in Israeli-occupied East Jerusalem, is in an area known to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif. It is the third holiest site for Muslims and the holiest for Jews, who know it as the Temple Mount. Under current arrangements, non-Muslims aren't allowed to pray there and Ben Gvir wants to change that.    The UAE ""strongly"" condemned Ben Gvir's visit without naming the minister, and called for the need to respect Jordan's custodianship of the holy site. It later joined China in calling for an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council on the matter.    ""However unhappy they (Bahrain and the UAE) might be towards the emergence of Israel's most right-wing government, it's clear that they've chosen to air these concerns privately, and have stopped short of letting them stand in the way of what they see as an important strategic relationship,"" Elham Fakhro, a research fellow at the Centre for Gulf Studies at the University of Exeter, England, told CNN.    But the UAE has said earlier that the more friendly ties with the Arab world weren't a green light for Israel to expand its territory. In June 2020, Yousef Al Otaiba, the UAE ambassador to the United States, warned Israel that its relations with Arab nations would suffer if there is any ""illegal seizure of Palestinian land.""    Abdullah, the professor from the UAE, said that Abu Dhabi may have some leverage over Israel that it may use privately at times, but added that ultimately ""everybody knows that nobody today has any leverage over Israel. Even America.""    Still, the UAE-Israel relationship is not everlasting, he said. ""This relationship is going to be dictated by the UAE... When it doesn't serve the interest of the UAE... it can collapse at any time.""   With additional reporting by Nadeen Ebrahim   The digest  Turkey's ruling party mulls bringing elections 'slightly' forward  Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan's ruling AK Party is considering a ""slight change"" on the date of elections scheduled for mid-June, Reuters cited AK Party spokesman Omer Celik as saying on Monday. Since the date of the elections corresponds with the summer holiday season, the party is evaluating bringing it ""slightly forward,"" he said.  Background: Turkey's parliamentary and presidential elections are scheduled to be held on June 18, and Erdogan previously said elections would be held in June. The date change would not amount to snap elections, Celik said. 
Why it matters: The elections are set to take place as Turkey faces soaring inflation and an economic downturn that could hurt Erdogan's prospects for re-election. But the government has of late tried to win back voter support through populist moves including wage hikes, retirement benefits, social aid, energy and agriculture support.   Amnesty condemns Iran for upholding protester death sentence  Amnesty International on Monday condemned the Iranian supreme court's decision to uphold the death sentence of protester Mohammad Boroughani, who according to Iranian state media is accused of stabbing a security guard during a protest.   Background: Boroughani will be executed under the ""moharebeh law,"" or waging war against God, the state-aligned Tasnim news agency said. Prior to the supreme court's confirmation of the sentence, he was sentenced to death by a revolutionary court during a group trial in Tehran presided by notorious judge Abolghasem Salavati, Amnesty said.   
Why it matters: The protester is among 26 others identified by Amnesty last month as being at risk of execution in connection to the country's nationwide protests. Iran has already carried out two protest-related executions over the past months of unrest. CNN has verified that at least 43 detainees are facing execution. The situation has drawn strong criticism from several European countries, including Germany, France and Britain.    Iran's judiciary indicts two French nationals and a Belgian for espionage  Iran has indicted two French nationals and a Belgian for espionage and working against the country's national security, Reuters reported, citing the semi-official Student News Network on Tuesday. The agency did not give the names of the three or say where or when they were indicted.  Background: Belgium's justice minister said last month that Belgian aid worker Olivier Vandecasteele had been sentenced to 28 years in prison in Iran for what he called a ""fabricated series of crimes."" Iranian media aired a video in October in which two French citizens appeared to confess to spying. The video sparked outrage in France, which said the detainees were ""state hostages."" 
Why it matters: A total of seven French citizens are being held in Iran, France's foreign minister said in November. Iran has accused foreign adversaries of fomenting the wave of unrest that erupted three months ago. The protests mark one of the boldest challenges to the country's leadership since its 1979 Islamic Revolution and have drawn in Iranians from all walks of life.  What's trending   Regional: #HalaRonaldo (Hello, Ronaldo)  Soccer fans in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states are celebrating the arrival of famed Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo in Riyadh, who touched down in the kingdom on Tuesday ahead of his unveiling ceremony with the Al Nassr Football Club.

Israel's far-right Ben Gvir visits flashpoint Jerusalem holy site as Palestinians slam 'provocation',2023-01-03,"Israel's far-right national security minister Itamar Ben Gvir on Tuesday visited the Jerusalem compound known as the Temple Mount by Jews and the Haram al-Sharif or Noble Sanctuary by Muslims, in a move that drew international condemnation.  Videos published on Israeli media showed Ben Gvir walking through the compound surrounded by Israeli police.  Tensions are high over the flashpoint complex, which is the holiest site in Judaism and the third holiest in Islam. It contains the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the site of the destroyed first and second Jewish Temples. Only Muslims are allowed to pray at the complex under a decades-old agreement; Ben Gvir believes that Jews should have the right to pray there, too. Palestinians immediately objected to the visit. ""We strongly condemn extremist Ben Gvir's storming of the blessed Al-Aqsa Mosque, and we consider it an unprecedented provocation and a serious threat,"" the Palestinian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. ""We hold (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu responsible for its consequences on the conflict and the region."" Ben Gvir entered the compound on Tuesday but not the Al-Aqsa Mosque building itself. The lawmaker's visit was his first since he was sworn in last week as national security minister, in what is set to be the most right-wing government in Israel's history. It is led by Netanyahu, who has returned for his sixth term as prime minister at the head of a coalition that includes several extremist parties.  Ben Gvir, the leader of the far-right Jewish Power (Otzma Yehudit) party, has previously been convicted for supporting terrorism and inciting anti-Arab racism. As national security minister, he oversees police in Israel as well as some police activity in the occupied West Bank. Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that runs Gaza, warned that Ben Gvir's visit would be a ""precursor for the ignition of the region"" and it will be ""pouring fuel over fire."" ""The Israeli government of which I am a member will not surrender to a vile murdering organization,"" Ben Gvir responded in a tweet. ""The Temple Mount is open to everyone and if Hamas thinks that if it threatens me it will deter me, let them understand that times have changed. There is a government in Jerusalem!"" Under the so-called status quo agreement dating back to Ottoman rule of Jerusalem, only Muslims are allowed to pray inside the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, and non-Muslims are allowed to visit the complex only at certain times. Israel and other states agreed to maintain status quo access to these holy sites after Israel captured them in the 1967 war. Some religious nationalist Jewish groups have been demanding access to the Temple Mount area for Jewish prayer. There have been several instances of Jewish visitors conducting prayers on the compound, sparking outrage from Muslim authorities and forced removals by Israeli police. Visits by Israeli political figures have historically preceded periods of violence between Israel and Palestinians. The conservative Israeli opposition leader Ariel Sharon's visit to the complex in September 2000 contributed to the start of the Second Intifada, a yearslong Palestinian uprising against Israel. 'People will die' Former Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid criticized Netanyahu over the visit, calling him ""weak"" for entrusting the ""most irresponsible man in the Middle East to the most explosive place in the Middle East.""   In a tweet, Lapid called the visit a ""provocation that will lead to violence that will endanger human life and cost human lives,"" and said that it's time for Netanyahu to tell Ben Gvir, ""you don't go up to the Temple Mount because people will die.""  The visit also drew a chorus of international criticism. The UAE ""strongly condemned the storming of Al-Aqsa Mosque courtyard by an Israeli minister under the protection of Israeli forces,"" in a statement without mentioning Ben Gvir by name. The Gulf nation has been attempting to maintain its support for the Palestinians while balancing its newly formed partnership with Israel. The country has issued past condemnations, particularly over events that raise tension over the holy sites in Jerusalem.  Egypt's foreign ministry ""warned of the negative repercussions of such measures on security and stability"" and called ""on all parties to exercise restraint and responsibility and refrain from any measures that would inflame the situation."" Jordan condemned Ben Gvir's visit in the ""strongest"" terms, calling it ""a flagrant and unacceptable violation of international law, and of the historical and legal status quo in Jerusalem and its sanctities.""   Jordan's monarchy has been the custodian of Jerusalem's holy sites since 1924 and sees itself as the guarantor of the religious rights of Muslims and Christians in the city. The 57-member Organisation of Islamic Cooperation also issued a statement holding Israel responsible for the repercussions of ""aggression"" against Palestinian people. A US embassy spokesperson said: ""Ambassador (Tom) Nides has been very clear in conversations with the Israeli government on the issue of preserving the status quo in Jerusalem's holy sites. Actions that prevent that are unacceptable.""  The British consulate in Jerusalem said in a statement on Facebook that it was ""concerned"" by Ben Gvir's visit and said it ""remains committed to the status quo.""  In a tweet about the site Tuesday evening, Germany's ambassador to Israel, Steffen Seibert, warned against ""actions that could increase tensions."" The leader of the Iran-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah said the visit will not only cause unrest in Palestinian territories ""but may ignite the entire region."" In a televised speech Tuesday, Hassan Nasrallah also stated Hezbollah doesn't fear Israel's new right-wing government. ""It's composed of freaks and crazy people,"" he said. Netanyahu insisted Tuesday that his government was not seeking to change the rules at the site. ""Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is committed to strictly maintaining the status quo, without changes, on the Temple Mount,"" a statement from his office said.  ""We will not be dictated to by Hamas. Under the status quo, ministers have gone up to the Temple Mount in recent years, including Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan; therefore, the claim that a change has been made in the status quo is without foundation.""","{'neg': 0.178, 'neu': 0.822, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.3818}",44,42.0,0.07150000000000001,0.8775000000000001,0.05083333333333334,-0.20299999999999999,0.101,0.82,0.079,-0.9888,-8.931999999999999,-34.06029444444445,252.0,-0.1351598985890653
Four things to watch out for in the Middle East in 2023,2023-01-02,"The event that dominated the world's news agenda in 2022 was the Ukraine war and its far-reaching repercussions. Its impact was felt deeply in the Middle East, with the region's energy supplies, strategic waterways, and even weapons industries playing a key role in the war.   Last year saw adversaries of the West strengthening ties with Middle Eastern states, sometimes at the West's expense. Gulf Arab states, keen to remain neutral in what they saw as a world order moving towards multipolarity, found themselves in an awkward position with their traditional allies in the West when asked to choose sides in the Ukraine war.   The war also -- perhaps inadvertently -- pushed Arab oil producers closer to Russia at the OPEC oil cartel, inviting the United States' wrath. And as China's relations with the US frayed, they continued to strengthen with Saudi Arabia.  But even as the Middle East's ties with the West fluctuated, its relevance remained intact and perhaps even grew. Europe increasingly looked to the region for energy security. Qatar, which hosted the 2022 World Cup, is set to become an even more significant gas supplier to Europe in the coming years.  Meanwhile, two Middle Eastern neighbors, Iran and Turkey, supplied opposing sides of the war in Ukraine with drones that had a significant impact on the battlefield.   The war saw Ankara's international prominence grow, whether through its attempts to mediate between the warring parties or its grandstanding at NATO that stalled the alliance's expansion. All that gave a domestic boost to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan as Turkey's economy reeled from an inflation-driven downturn.  Here's what to watch out for in the Middle East in 2023:    Erdogan's grip on power may be tested as Turkey celebrates its centennial  President Erdogan had set an ambitious set of goals for his nation in its centennial. But as the Turkish republic celebrates its hundredth year in 2023, Erdogan may find himself focused instead on trying to hold on to his seat.  The Turkish lira has been plummeting in value for four years and the cost of living has been skyrocketing as a result of Erdogan's unorthodox and widely criticized monetary policies that have shied away from raising interest rates to curb inflation.   Coupled with years of governance fatigue and a new generation of voters who are looking for change, 2023 could potentially mark the decline of Erdogan's grip on power.  Elections, which are expected to take place in early summer, had dominated Turkey's domestic agenda for much of last year. For the first time in years, the opposition -- at least for now -- seems united around fielding a candidate that could unseat Erdogan. Last year saw the president suffer a major setback in opinion polls, with his approval rate slipping. The presidential system, engineered and implemented by Erdogan himself, requires a 50% plus 1 majority in elections -- a tough proposition for the leader as the economy slows.   On the international front, the key NATO ally continues to struggle through its uneasy alliance with the US and Europe. The US' ongoing support for an armed Kurdish group in Syria that Turkey views as a national threat and a cold personal relationship between Erdogan and US President Joe Biden underscore the tense relationship.   Unresolved disputes with Greece over sea borders in the Mediterranean as well as a war of words over a Greek military deployment in small Aegean islands close to Turkey continue to raise tensions with Europe. Whether or not the relationship with Europe can grow beyond cooperation over keeping migrants and refugees confined to Turkey will depend on finding common ground.  When it comes to Ukraine, the Turkish position, regardless of who is victorious in the elections, will remain largely unchanged. The policy of ""pro-Ukrainian neutrality,"" as it is called locally, has paid off with a globally impactful grain deal and has kept the Turkish economy from taking further blows.  By Gul Tuysuz    Israel's lurch to the right  Israel has a new government, and although it's led by a familiar face -- Benjamin Netanyahu -- it is made up of some of the most extreme right-wing figures to hold ministerial positions in Israeli history. Especially of note are Itamar Ben Gvir, national security minister in charge of Israeli police, and Bezalel Smotrich, finance minister who will have a say in the policies that affect the movement of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. Both are right-wing settler-lawyers turned politicians who were once considered the far fringe of Israeli politics.     These ministers are setting off alarm bells for many in the international community, including the United States, who are concerned their actions could further deteriorate the security situation on the ground. Ben Gvir and his ilk have openly talked about changing the status quo at Jerusalem's holiest site -- known as Temple Mount to Jews and Haram al-Sharif to Muslims -- where only Muslims are permitted to pray. But actions in the compound in the past have sparked an uprising and even a war.    Then there's the West Bank, where Smotrich will have a big hand in determining policy. Last year was the deadliest for both Palestinians and Israelis in decades. Security cooperation between the Israeli military and the Palestinian security forces, which has long been seen by Israeli leaders as a key to keeping the West Bank calm, was already strained last year.     Netanyahu has always run his governments as a one-man show, often de facto taking on such roles as that of the foreign minister. In recent interviews, he has repeatedly claimed that he and his Likud party will dictate policy. But allies, like major Jewish figures in the US, are concerned Netanyahu has built something he won't be able to fully control. One of the biggest questions is how the Biden administration will work with the Israeli government -- and if it will even interact with the two controversial ministers. So far, the US is taking a wait-and-see approach, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken saying in December that the US will judge the Israeli government ""by the policies it pursues rather than individual personalities.""    By Hadas Gold  A more cohesive OPEC+  When the OPEC+ cartel of oil-exporting nations including Saudi Arabia and Russia decided in October to cut production by two million barrels a day, it was seen by observers as a political gamble on the part of Riyadh, the group's de facto leader. The larger-than-usual cut was interpreted in the US as an attempt to raise oil prices ahead of midterm elections as the West tried to choke off the Russian oil revenues that were funding the war.   But just weeks after the cuts, oil prices dropped to pre-war levels amid concerns about a looming global recession and a slow Chinese exit from Covid-19 lockdowns. The drop prompted Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman to reiterate that the cartel's decision was right and not politically driven.  That price drop created confidence in the prince's guidance of the group, said Amena Bakr, Chief OPEC Correspondent at Energy Intelligence, an energy information company. ""I expect 2023 to be a year where OPEC+ remains very much united,"" she said, adding that a globally isolated Russia needs the alliance and is likely to go along with the group's decisions.   An uncertainty that may persist into 2023, however, is how the price caps imposed by Western nations on Russian oil in December may affect the market and in turn the price of global oil.   As a result, Russia has said that it may cut production by up to 700,000 barrels a day. But Energy Intelligence predicts that Russian crude and condensate production could drop by as much as 1.2 million barrels a day, said Bakr. That's over 1% of the global supply. If a gap emerges in the market, the cartel could even consider adding more barrels, she said.   Gulf states are also likely to become important providers of gas to Europe as it weans itself off Russian supplies. Qatar signed its first gas agreement with Germany in 2022 and another one with France, while neighboring UAE also signed gas deals with Germany and Austria. The country has also been touted by European officials as a future exporter of renewables to Europe.   By Abbas Al Lawati    An increasingly isolated Iran  As the international community was consumed by Iran's regional ambitions and the never-ending nuclear negotiation last year, an entire generation of repressed women at home shook the foundations of the Islamic Republic.  After 22-year-old Mahsa Jina Amini died while in the custody of the nation's notorious morality police, the government found itself facing protesters in the streets of almost every major city in one of the strongest challenges to the Islamic Republic since the 1979 revolution that brought it to power.   Those protests, and Iran's support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine, further complicated Tehran's relations with the West, making an elusive nuclear agreement even more difficult to achieve. How the protests play out could dictate the course of the Islamic Republic's domestic, regional and foreign relations in 2023.  The momentum of the protests has slowed, and while the government actively works on a deterrence strategy, it is clear that a barrier of fear has been broken.   But if domestic woes were not enough for the Islamic Republic, it is now also dealing with shifting international geopolitics, including a burgeoning Chinese-Saudi partnership and a Russian ally that is now completely embroiled in a protracted war.  The continuation of crippling Western sanctions on Iran has pushed it further east to China, its biggest trade partner. In 2021, a 25-year strategic ""cooperation"" pact worth $400 billion of investment deals was signed between the two nations.  But as Saudi Arabia and Iran remain diplomatic enemies, and as Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman warms up to Xi amid a Saudi quarrel with Biden over OPEC, the developing China-Saudi relationship, and its effect on the Islamic Republic, is one to watch in 2023.   Regionally, Iran's archenemy, Benjamin Netanyahu, is back in power in Israel, with his attention firmly on Tehran's nuclear program.   With an ailing Supreme Leader, Iran's leadership could be looking to firm up his successor, and as the elite Quds Force mourns the third anniversary of the loss of its leader Qassem Soleimani, Iraq's attempts to break away from Iran's influence also remains a challenge for Tehran.

Benjamin Netanyahu sworn in as leader of Israel's likely most right-wing government ever,2022-12-29,"Benjamin Netanyahu Thursday completed a dramatic return as Israel's prime minister, after being sworn in as the leader of what is likely to be the country's most right-wing government in history.  Netanyahu and his government were sworn in on Thursday for his sixth term as prime minister, 18 months after he was ousted from power.  He returns with the support of several far-right figures once consigned to the fringes of Israeli politics, after cobbling together a coalition shortly before last week's deadline. Members of Netanyahu's Likud party will fill some of the most important cabinet positions, including foreign minister, defense minister and justice minister. But a number of politicians from the far right of Israel's political spectrum were set to be appointed to ministerial posts, despite controversy over their positions during the run-up to November's election, which was won by a Netanyahu-led bloc of ultra-nationalist and ultra-religious parties.  Itamar Ben Gvir, an extremist who has been convicted for supporting terrorism and inciting anti-Arab racism, will take on a newly expanded public security role, renamed national security minister, overseeing police in Israel plus some police activity in the occupied West Bank. Bezalel Smotrich, leader of the Religious Zionism party, has been named minister of finance, and has also been given power to appoint the head of the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), an Israeli military unit which among its duties handles border crossings and permits for Palestinians. During his campaign, Smotrich had proposed a series of drastic legal reforms, seen by many critics as a clear way to undercut judicial independence. This includes dropping the ability to charge a public servant with fraud and breach of trust -- a charge Netanyahu faces in his ongoing corruption trial.  Netanyahu has pleaded not guilty and called that trial a ""witch hunt"" and an ""attempted coup,"" and has called for changes to Israel's judiciary system.  Aryeh Deri, leader of the ultra-Orthodox Sephardi party Shas, will serve as interior minister and minister of health.  As the new ministers were preparing to be sworn in at the Knesset, the country's parliament, around 2,000 demonstrators gathered outside to protest Netanyahu's return to office, the Jerusalem Police spokesperson said.  The rightward shift in the Israeli government has raised eyebrows abroad and at home. On Wednesday, over 100 retired Israeli ambassadors and foreign ministry officials expressed concerns about Israel's incoming government in a signed letter to Netanyahu.  The ex-diplomats, including former ambassadors to France, India, and Turkey, expressed ""profound concern at the serious damage to Israel's foreign relations, its international standing and its core interests abroad emanating from what will apparently be the policy of the incoming Government.""  The letter pointed to ""statements made by potential senior office-holders in the Government and the Knesset,"" reports of policy changes in the West Bank, and ""some possible extreme and discriminatory laws"" as a point of concern.  US Ambassador to Israel Tom Nides congratulated Netanyahu on Thursday, writing on Twitter: ""Here's to the rock solid US-Israel relationship and unbreakable ties."" Nides is married to Virginia Moseley, CNN US Executive Vice President for Editorial. A National Security Council spokesperson noted Netanyahu has ""repeatedly said he will set the policy of his government"" as he enters a coalition with far-right parties. ""As we have made clear, we do not support policies that endanger the viability of a two-state solution or contradict our mutual interests and values,"" the spokesperson said.   Biden administration officials have largely avoided addressing the ultra-right components of the new Israeli government. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last week that the US ""will engage with and judge our partners in Israel on the basis of the policies they pursue, not the personalities that happen to form the government."" Netanyahu's slim November victory came in the fifth Israeli election in less than four years, amid a period of protracted political chaos during which he has remained a dominant figure.  In his address to the Knesset on Thursday, Netanyahu said that of the three major tasks assigned to his government, the first will be to ""thwart Iran's efforts to obtain nuclear weapons."" The second priority would be to develop the country's infrastructure, including the launching of a bullet train and the third would be to sign more peace agreements with Arab nations ""in order to end the Israeli-Arab conflict.""  Netanyahu was already Israel's longest-serving prime minister, having previously held the post from 2009 to 2021 and before that for one term in the late 1990s.  Israel also got its first openly gay speaker of parliament on Thursday. Amir Ohana, a former minister of justice and public security, is a member of the Knesset representing Netanyahu's Likud party.  Some ultra-Orthodox lawmakers who had refused to attend his swearing-in at the Knesset seven years ago were among those who voted for him on Thursday.  Ahead of the parliamentary vote on the new government, outgoing Prime Minister Yair Lapid tweeted: ""We pass on to you a state in excellent condition. Try not to ruin it, we'll be right back. The handover files are ready.""

Jordan king warns of 'red lines' in Jerusalem as Netanyahu returns to office,2022-12-28,"Jordan's king says he is prepared for conflict should the status of Jerusalem's holy sites change as Israel prepares to swear in what is likely to be the most right-wing government in its history.   King Abdullah II told CNN's Becky Anderson in an exclusive interview this month that there is ""concern"" in his country about those in Israel trying to push for changes to his custodianship of the Muslim and Christian holy sites in Israeli-occupied East Jerusalem, warning that he has ""red lines.""   ""If people want to get into a conflict with us, we're quite prepared,"" he said. ""I always like to believe that, let's look at the glass half full, but we have certain red lines... And if people want to push those red lines, then we will deal with that.""   Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu's incoming government is expected to be the most right-wing in Israel's history and it includes controversial figures who were once considered to be on the extreme fringe of Israeli politics. This has caused concerns about the potential for an escalation in Israeli-Palestinian violence and for the future of Israel's relations with its Arab neighbors and Western allies.   This year was already the deadliest for Palestinians and Israelis in nearly two decades, raising the specter of a new Palestinian uprising against Israel.    ""We have to be concerned about a next intifada (uprising),"" said the king. ""And if that happens, that's a complete breakdown of law and order and one that neither the Israelis nor the Palestinians will benefit from. I think there is a lot of concern from all of us in the region, including those in Israel that are on our side on this issue, to make sure that doesn't happen.""   Israel captured East Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 war but signed a peace treaty with it in 1994 under which it formally recognized Amman's special role at the city's holy sites. But the two have since had an uneasy relationship, with Jordan regularly accusing Israel of violating the agreement that gave it control of the sites and barred non-Muslims from praying there.   Jordan's Hashemite monarchy has been the custodian of Jerusalem's holy sites since 1924 and sees itself as the guarantor of the religious rights of Muslims and Christians in the city.   Tensions are highest over the compound known to Muslims as the Haram Al Sharif, which is called the Temple Mount by Jews. The site includes the Al Aqsa Mosque, the third holiest site in Islam. The area is also the holiest site in Judaism. Politicians on the Israeli right often argue that Jews should also have a right to pray there.   One of the most controversial figures in Israel's incoming government is Itamar Ben Gvir, who is set to become the national security minister and assume control over the police, including law enforcement at Jerusalem's holy sites. Ben Gvir has a long history of inciting violence against Palestinians and Arabs. He has been convicted of inciting anti-Arab racism and supporting terrorism and has openly called for changing the status quo at the holy sites.   ""I don't think those individuals are under just a Jordanian microscope. They're under an international microscope,"" the king said, responding to a question about Ben Gvir's views. ""I have to believe that there's a lot of people in Israel also that are concerned as much as we are.""   He refused to say how Jordan would respond to changes in the status of the holy sites. ""At the end of the day, the Israeli people have the right to pick whoever they want to lead them... We will work with anybody and everybody as long as we can bring people together,"" he said.  Of Jordan's population of around 10 million, more than half is of Palestinian descent, including more than two million Palestinian refugees.    Jordan was the second Arab nation to normalize relations with Israel, after Egypt. But after a decades-long wait, Israel scored a major diplomatic victory in 2020 by gaining recognition from four more Arab states, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan.   The nation's relationship with Israel is heavily scrutinized at home, with many opposing further strengthening of ties due to Israel's treatment of the Palestinians.   Israel's integration into the region is ""extremely important"" but it is ""not going to happen unless there's a future for the Palestinians,"" the king said, pointing to the overwhelming support shown by Arab football fans for Palestinians at the Qatar FIFA World Cup.   The king has redoubled efforts to shed light on the status of Christians in the Middle East of late. In September, he proclaimed at the United Nations General Assembly in New York that Christianity in Jerusalem was ""under fire,"" a message the patriarchs and Heads of the Churches in Jerusalem endorsed.    Some churches in the Holy Land have also been sounding the alarm about the status of Christians there. In a Christmas message this week, the Heads of Churches in Jerusalem, a grouping of Palestinian churches, issued a statement decrying the ""assault"" on their exercise of religion and ""unwarranted restrictions"" on worship. In July, the Higher Presidential Committee of Church Affairs in Palestine issued a statement condemning an attack by ""extremist Israeli settlers"" on the Church of the Holy Spirit and the Greek Garden, accusing the Israeli government of complicity through ""inaction"" in holding the perpetrators to account.    Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Lior Haiat told CNN the Heads of Churches ""have full access to every governmental authority for concerns they have,"" adding that acts of violence ""on any community are condemned by the government and investigated with the utmost seriousness by Israeli police.""   ""The State of Israel remains committed to safeguarding freedom of religion and worship for all, including the Christian community, in Jerusalem and other holy sites,"" he said.   King Abdullah told CNN that churches in Jerusalem face challenges from ""policies on the ground,"" causing the Christian community to come under pressure.  ""This is not a national policy, but there are those that join governments that have very extremist views towards Muslims and Christians, as there are on the other side obviously, and we have to unify against that,"" he said.   Christians in the Middle East are ""part of our past, they're part of our present, and they must be part of our future,"" he added.   Jordan has become a safe haven for Middle Eastern Christians for the better part of the past two decades as neighboring countries have been embroiled in conflicts that have pushed some of the oldest Christian communities in the world to flee their homelands.    In December, the monarch launched a master plan to develop Bethany Beyond the Jordan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site where Christians believe Jesus was baptized. The plan aims to build lodging, museums and amphitheatres catering to as many as 1.5 million tourists per year.   ""I think one of the things that people misunderstand about this place is how inclusive it is. Almost 15% of the visitors that come here are Muslim,"" he told CNN. ""So this is an opportunity to break down those barriers and to show how proud we are of not only our historical Christian heritage here in Jordan, but the relationship between Christianity and Islam.""   People in the Middle East ""just want to move on with their lives,"" said the monarch. ""So, as challenging as 2022 was, and as difficult as the dangers of 2023 are, there's an opportunity for us to move beyond.""   That can be done through regional integration, he said.    ""I've gotten away from the feeling that politics are going to solve our problems. It's economic dependency,"" he said. ""When I am invested in your success because your success is my success, at the end of the day means we can move forward.""    With additional reporting by CNN's Mike Schwartz in Jerusalem.

"December 22, 2022 Russia-Ukraine news",2022-12-21,"Our live coverage of Russia's war in Ukraine has moved here. Russian President Vladimir Putin said the word ""war"" on Thursday while talking to reporters about the fighting in Ukraine.  The former KGB officer, who chooses his words carefully, has often referred to the war in Ukraine as a ""special military operation."" ""Our goal is not to spin the flywheel of military conflict, but, on the contrary, to end this war,"" Putin told reporters in Moscow after attending a State Council meeting on youth policy. ""We have been and will continue to strive for this,"" he continued. After attending the meeting, Putin took questions from reporters on various topics, including the fighting in Ukraine, the US shipment of a Patriot missile defense system to Ukraine and the Russian economy. The head of the Russian mercenary group Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said Thursday claims by the United States that his group took weapons deliveries from North Korea are ""nothing more than gossip and speculation."" ""Everyone knows that it's been a long time since North Korea has supplied weapons to the Russian Federation,"" Prigozhin said in a statement published on his Telegram channel. ""And no other such attempts have even been made. Therefore, these arms deliveries from the DPRK are nothing more than gossip and speculation."" ""On our behalf, I want to stress that - and I've already answered this question today - we buy quite a lot of American weapons. And that is why my lawyers will more than likely take an active part in the process to lift the U.S. sanctions on the supply of weapons to the Wagner PMC,"" he said.  ""We believe these restrictions are completely unfair, due to the fact that Wagner PMC has never violated international trade rules when buying the US weapons,"" Prigozhin said.  ""Unfortunately, Mr. Kirby makes a lot of statements based on speculation,"" Prigozhin said in response to remarks by the strategic communications coordinator at the US National Security Council John Kirby.   Earlier Thursday Kirby said that ""it's pretty apparent to us that Wagner is emerging as a rival power center to the Russian military and other Russian Ministries” and that it is recruiting convicts, including some with serious medical conditions.  Russian citizens are crowdfunding to equip soldiers deployed to Ukraine as winter closes in on the battlefield. Troops have complained they are short of basic equipment – and the message has reached Russian President Vladimir Putin. He and other officials say they are working to overcome issues with supplying newly mobilized troops, partially blaming supply chain issues. But the Kremlin has also stepped up pressure on those who dare to complain – and is increasingly framing the invasion of Ukraine as a patriotic and almost existential cause. Local campaigns are raising funds for soldiers in both Russia and the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) in eastern Ukraine. One, dubbed “Together is Warmer,” has raised 3 million rubles (about $45,000) to provide basic equipment and clothing for Russian soldiers. A Telegram channel detailed last month how citizens helped supply the DPR’s 6th Motorized Rifles, a company of 74 men. The channel listed what the citizens bought: Uniforms, thermal underwear, socks, hats, balaclavas, sweaters, berets, a generator, power banks, medicines, clothes, boots and even two wheelchairs, which the company took to the hospital. In the Chuvashia region, where the mobilization prompted protests in the fall, Telegram channels said that families had gone into debt buying equipment.  “From officials there, all they got was parting words and three sacks of potatoes,” one said. Many of the public crowdfunding appeals focus on preventing hypothermia among soldiers fighting without adequate clothing and shelter in sub-zero temperatures. In the central Russian city of Tambov, for example, 8th grade schoolchildren raised money for socks for the troops. But some also try to source thermal imagery devices, two-way radios, body armor or even drones. Maxim Samorukov, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, wrote in Foreign Policy magazine last week: “Ordinary Russians are expected to help their friends and relatives who have had the misfortune of being drafted. Indeed, they have little option but to cover the deficiencies in state provisions out of their own pockets simply to protect their loved ones.” Read more on the Russian supply issues — and Moscow's official response — here. In his address on Capitol Hill Wednesday evening, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky thrust the frontline city of Bakhmut onto the world stage, describing the situation there in moving terms. In a roughly 25-minute speech, six minutes were dedicated to the situation in and around the city. Members of Congress stood and applauded four times as Zelensky recounted Bakhmut's fate. Here's why the city has become a rallying point for Ukrainian fortitude: Months of fierce fighting: Bakhmut rests in the gentle rolling hillocks of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region. It lies on the road to the much bigger and more strategically important cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk. During the past 10 months of Russia’s war on Ukraine, the city has risen to infamy. It's regularly referred to as the most contested and kinetic area of the conflict. Zelensky's advisers and generals have called the battles for Bakhmut “fierce,” “hot” and “difficult.” The fire and brimstone unleashed by the Russian advance has left it in ruins, a smoking shell of its former self. This fate has burnished Bakhmut’s power as a symbol of Ukrainian resistance. In the face of devastating Russian attacks, it is still holding on.  On the ground in Bakhmut: Various CNN teams have visited the city in recent months. They witnessed the devastation and dereliction. They saw firsthand the impact it was having on the Ukrainian soldiers there, and the shellshock affecting the hardy residents who remained. Despite all that, Ukraine has held off Moscow's troops from overtaking the city, allowing Kyiv to fortify important surrounding cities and lessening the blow if Russia ever does prevail there. In the meantime, Bakhmut has become more than just a city fighting for survival – it is now the beating heart and one of the most powerful emblems of the country’s resistance. Read Shukla's full report here. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he discussed Kyiv's peace proposal with his Group of Seven colleagues this morning after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s visit to Washington.  “I can just tell you that we’re looking at what he’s put forward. I was just on the — the video with our G7 partners this morning. And this is one of the things that we talked about,” Blinken told CNN’s Kylie Atwood.  Blinken called Zelensky’s peace proposals “a good start.” “They’re things that everyone should be able to, in one way or another, to rally to,” he said. Blinken would not say how long it would take for the US and Ukraine to evaluate the plan together. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said the two sides agreed to reviewing the plan yesterday in the meeting between US President Joe Biden and Zelensky. What borders would Ukraine accept in a peace deal? Blinken said the US and Ukraine agreed on the overall peace effort underway. He did not respond more directly to a question of whether Kyiv would accept a goal of reclaiming territory up to its borders before the Feb. 24 invasion. Blinken has previously said that's the US focus, while Zelensky has outlined broader visions for retaking the Crimean peninsula that Russia annexed in 2014. “What’s clear from all of our conversations with Ukraine, including the conversations just yesterday between President Biden and President Zelensky, is that we have the same objectives, the same goals: a free and independent, a prosperous, a democratic Ukraine, one that demonstrates that the principles of the United Nations charter are being upheld, including on territorial integrity and sovereignty and independence, and that’s something the president reiterated yesterday,” Blinken said. Blinken said Ukraine has told the US that it is currently focused on taking back its eastern and southern territory that has been occupied since February. “But that doesn’t prejudge in any way where this goes, where it settles,” said Blinken at his year-end news conference, emphasizing that it would be up to Ukraine to decide what a “just and durable” peace looks like. Blinken also reiterated that Russia has shown “no meaningful interest” in diplomacy to end the war. For his part, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that his administration has always been open to talks and that ""it was the Ukrainian leadership that refused itself to conduct negotiations.” US President Joe Biden's administration rolled out new sanctions on 10 Russian naval entities after Russian operations against Ukrainian ports, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced Thursday. Here are more of the latest developments: Patriot missile systems training: The US has trained approximately 3,100 Ukrainian troops to date on different systems, with training on the newly announced Patriot missile systems set to begin “very soon,” a senior defense official said.
Russian mercenary firm's expanding influence: Newly downgraded US intelligence suggests the Russian mercenary group Wagner has assumed expanded influence and is recruiting convicts — including some with serious medical conditions — from prisons to supplement Moscow’s flagging military. The group recently took delivery of arms from North Korea, a top US official said, in a sign of its growing role in the war in Ukraine.

Lukashenko denies ""conspiracy"" to enter war: The recent movement of Belarusian armed forces is not part of a plan to get involved in Russia's war in Ukraine, President Alexander Lukashenko said Thursday. Ongoing military exercises ""are more extensive because of the current situation and threats. Therefore, we are conducting exercises on our territory,"" Lukashenko said. ""That's it. No other intent, no conspiracy."" 
Ukrainian public hails Zelensky: CNN spoke to members of the public throughout Ukraine to gauge their reaction to Zelensky's overseas trip and the way he was received by US lawmakers. Mariya Hrachova, a marketing director in Kyiv, said she is always moved by Zelensky's speeches, and Wednesday was no different. ""When he spoke to the House of Representatives, the way he looked, he didn't wear a suit, he was himself,"" she said. ""He spoke the truth, he said what he wanted, what he had to say, I admire that."" ##Catch Up## Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham’s amendment related to seized Russian oligarch’s assets and transferring them to the people of Ukraine passed by voice vote.  It’s the fourth amendment to be approved Thursday to the US government funding bill. “This amendment would allow the Department of Justice through the Secretary of State to transfer proceeds from seized oligarch’s assets or other sanctioned entities to the people of Ukraine,”  Graham said. “It will be a god send to the long suffering people of the Ukraine. It will be a relief to the American taxpayer… It will be a bad day for oligarchs.”  The US has trained approximately 3,100 Ukrainian troops to date on different systems, with training on the newly announced Patriot missile systems set to begin “very soon,” a senior defense official said. Nearly half of those troops have been trained on M777 howitzers or HIMARS rocket launchers, two of the systems that have been critical to Ukrainian operations so far. Ukrainian forces have also been trained on vehicles, various forms of artillery, drones and other systems.  The Pentagon will soon begin training Ukrainian personnel on how to operate and maintain the Patriot missile system, officially announced yesterday during President Volodymyr Zelensky’s visit to Washington. Though the Pentagon would not specify exactly when the training would begin or how long it would take for Ukrainians to master the complex system, a senior defense official said Wednesday it would start “very soon” and would take “several months.” The Patriot system costs between $450 and $550 million, the Pentagon said, depending on the configuration of the platform. Each missile costs approximately $4 million. The US will also soon start an expanded training program for Ukrainian forces, including joint maneuver and combined arms training. This program will train approximately 500 soldiers per month on larger combat operations. Newly downgraded US intelligence suggests the Russian mercenary group Wagner has assumed expanded influence and is recruiting convicts — including some with serious medical conditions — from prisons to supplement Moscow’s flagging military. The group recently took delivery of arms from North Korea, a top US official said, a sign of its growing role in the war in Ukraine. And the US believes Wagner could be locked in a power battle with the Russian military itself as it jockeys for influence with the Kremlin. “In certain instances, Russian military officials are actually subordinate to Wagner's command,” said John Kirby, the strategic communications coordinator at the National Security Council. “It's pretty apparent to us that Wagner is emerging as a rival power center to the Russian military and other Russian ministries.” The revelations about the Wagner Group came a day after Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky’s historic visit to Washington, where he thanked the United States for its military assistance and said more was needed to fend off Russian advances. Some background: Wagner has emerged as a key player in the 10-month conflict. The group is often described as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s off-the-books troops. It has expanded its footprint globally since its creation in 2014, and has been accused of war crimes in Africa, Syria and Ukraine. Kirby said the US estimates Wager currently has about 50,000 personnel deployed inside Ukraine, of which 40,00 could be convicts recruited from Russian prisons. He said the group was spending $100 million per month to fund its operations in Ukraine.  The group’s founder, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has even traveled personally to Russian prisons to recruit convicts himself to go to the front lines and fight. Some of them suffer from “serious medical conditions,” Kirby said. “It seems as though Mr. Prigozhin is willing to just throw Russian bodies into the meat grinder, in Bakhmut. In fact, about 1,000 Wagner fighters have been killed in the fighting in just recent weeks, and we believe that 90% of those 1,000 fighters were in fact convicts,” Kirby said. Prigozhin, who has sometimes been referred to as “Putin’s chef,” already has close ties to the Russian president. But Kirby suggested he was working to strengthen those ties through his efforts to bolster Russian forces through his mercenary recruitment. “It's all about how good he looks to Mr. Putin, and how well he's regarded at the Kremlin,” he said. “In fact, we would go so far as to say that his influence is expanding.” Last month, Wagner received a delivery of infantry rockets and missiles from North Korea, Kirby said, an indication of how Russia and its military partners continue to seek ways around Western sanctions and export controls. Wagner, not the Russian government, paid for the equipment. The US doesn’t believe it will significantly change the battlefield dynamic in Ukraine — but suggested North Korea could be planning to deliver further material. US President Joe Biden's administration rolled out new sanctions on 10 Russian naval entities after Russian operations against Ukrainian ports, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced on Thursday. “We are committed to imposing additional severe consequences on President Putin and his enablers for Russia’s unconscionable war against Ukraine. In the wake of Russian naval operations against Ukrainian ports, including those that are providing much-needed food and grain to the world, the United States today is imposing sanctions on Russian naval entities,” Blinken said.  The entities sanctioned include companies that produce different aspects of Russia’s naval capability. One of the sanctioned companies is a battery company, Rigel, that has been a supplier to the Russian navy for more than 15 years, the US State Department said. Also sanctioned was a central institute for scientific research, Elektropribor, which produces a navigation system for Russian combat ships.  “The United States remains determined to use all appropriate measures to deter Russia’s attacks on Ukraine – whether those attacks be from the air, land, or sea. These accountability measures underscore a simple message: the Kremlin must end its brutal campaign against Ukraine,” Blinken said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his first video message since leaving Washington, DC, on Wednesday that he is returning to his country with ""good results.""  In a selfie-style message on Telegram, the Ukrainian president said, “I am coming back from Washington. Coming with good results, that will really help.” He also thanked US President Joe Biden for his “assistance and for international leadership and for his commitment to victory."" ""I thank the US Congress, to both Houses, to all Parties who support Ukraine, to all those who wish us Victory as much as we wish it,” he added. Zelensky said that “we are bringing to Ukraine, to Donbas, to Bakhmut and to the South, solutions that our Defence Forces have been waiting for."" Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that Patriot missile defense systems are ""old"" systems and Russia will ""always find the antidote.""  ""In regards to Patriots, this is quite an old system and it doesn't work as well as our S-300,"" Putin said, when asked by a reporter to comment on the United States' decision to provide a Patriot system to Ukraine.  ""Those who oppose us think this is a defensive weapon, that's what they say,"" Putin said. ""But that's in their own mind and we'll always find the antidote.""  ""So those doing it are just wasting their time, it's just delaying the conflict,"" Putin said.  Some background: The Patriot’s radar system combines “surveillance, tracking, and engagement functions in one unit,” a description from the Center for Strategic International Studies (CSIS) says, which makes it stand out among other air defense systems. The system’s engagements with incoming aerial threats are “nearly autonomous” aside from needing a “final launch decision” from the humans operating it. The Group of Seven nations “are prepared to do more as needed on budget and economic support” for Ukraine in the year ahead, according to a joint statement from the group’s finance ministers Thursday. For 2023, the group has mobilized “up to $32 billion US dollars of budget and economic support for Ukraine and continue to make further progress,” said the statement published by the German government. “We also strongly encourage other donors to step up their support,” the finance ministers added. In 2022, the G7 mobilized $32.7 billion US dollars of budget support to the Ukrainian government, some $18 billion dollars of which came from the European Union, according to the G7. “We have a moral imperative to help Ukraine resist Russia’s unprovoked assault,” the statement said. Remember: The G7, or Group of Seven, is made up of allied leaders from some of the world’s largest economies: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the US. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky met with Polish President Andrzej Duda while returning to Ukraine from the US.  Zelensky posted a photo of him on Telegram meeting with Duda and said, “We summed up the year, which brought historic challenges due to a full-scale war.""  ""Also we discussed strategic plans for the future, bilateral relations and interactions at the international level in 2023,” he added. From the video accompanying the post, Zelensky is seen disembarking from a plane at Rzeszow airport. It is unclear what time he arrived in Poland.  Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said he held a phone call with his US counterpart Lloyd Austin following Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's visit to Washington, DC, and the announcement that the US will provide the Patriot missile defense system to Ukraine.   Reznikov tweeted that “PATRIOTic soldiers will master these systems quickly,” capitalizing part of the word in reference to the defense system.  Reznikov said he was “grateful for another package of security assistance, especially for the new capabilities to defend out skies from Russia’s brutal attacks.” On Wednesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced an additional $1.85 billion in security assistance for Ukraine.  Additionally, Ukrainian Air Force spokesperson Yurii Ihnat said he thinks the training of Ukrainian soldiers on the Patriot missile defense system “will be accelerated.”  He added that the training is taken “very seriously” by the Americans and that the training is “done strictly according to the rules.”  Ihnat said on Ukrainian television that he hoped the one unit “should be just the beginning” and that the Patriot can help protect “important strategic objects” such as infrastructure and headquarters locations.  Iran clapped back at Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky and warned of limited “patience for baseless accusations.” Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said the speech delivered by Zelensky from the United States Capitol repeated “accusations and indecent statements.”  “We have always respected the territorial integrity of countries, including Ukraine, and Mr. Zelensky should know that Iran's strategic patience for baseless accusations is limited,” a published statement by Kanaani said.  ""Mr. Zelensky should learn from the fate of some leaders of countries who relied on America's support,"" the statement said.  In his speech to the US Congress, Zelensky said that hundreds of deadly drones sent by Iran to Russia have become a threat to “critical infrastructure.”  Some background: The Iranian government acknowledged last month that it had sent a limited number of drones to Russia in the months before the start of its invasion of Ukraine, but has denied supplying military equipment for use in the war in Ukraine. Russia, Zelensky argued in strong terms, has “found an ally” in Iran. “That is how one terrorist has found the other,” Zelensky said.  “It is just a matter of time when they will strike against your other allies if we do not stop them now.” The fallout from Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky's historic visit to Washington DC continues, with praise at home and warnings from Russian officials.  Meanwhile, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has moved to squash speculation that recent troop movements were part of preparations to join the war in Ukraine. Here are the latest headlines: Lukashenko denies ""conspiracy"" to enter war: The recent movement of Belarusian armed forces is not part of a plan to get involved in Russia's war in Ukraine, Lukashenko said on Thursday. ""We have been having and are having exercises. Now they are more extensive because of the current situation and threats. Therefore, we are conducting exercises on our territory,"" said Lukashenko. ""That's it. No other intent, no conspiracy.""
Stage set for ""long confrontation with Russia"": The West supplying Ukraine with military support and Zelensky’s visit to Washington further demonstrates that ""the collective West is set for a long confrontation with Russia,"" said a spokeswoman for Russia's foreign ministry. 
US arms supplies will prolong ""suffering"": The US supplying Ukraine with Patriot missile systems will prolong the Ukrainian people's ""suffering,"" said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Thursday. Peskov also said that neither US President Joe Biden nor Zelensky showed ""a potential willingness to listen to Russia's concerns"" during the visit to Washington DC.
Zelensky makes case for continued US support: The White House believes Zelensky made a ""very compelling"" case to the American public and to lawmakers about the need for sustained US aid to Ukraine, a senior White House official said. As the White House prepares for Republicans — some of whom have cast doubt on the future of aid to Ukraine — to take over the House of Representatives, the official said the White House believes Zelensky's speech helped make the case. 
Ukrainian public hails Zelensky: CNN spoke to members of the public throughout Ukraine to gauge their reaction to Zelensky's visit and the way he was received by US lawmakers. Mariya Hrachova, a marketing director in Kyiv, said that she is always moved by Zelensky's speeches, and Wednesday was no different. ""When he spoke to the House of Representatives, the way he looked, he didn't wear a suit, he was himself,"" she said. ""He spoke the truth, he said what he wanted, what he had to say, I admire that.""
Putin calls Netanyahu: Russian President Vladimir Putin called Israeli Prime Minister-designate Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday to congratulate him on the formation of a new government and to discuss the situations in Ukraine and Iran. ""Prime Minister-designate Netanyahu told President Putin that he hopes a way will be found as soon as possible to end the war and the suffering caused by it,"" reads a statement from Netanyahu's office. ##Catch Up## The chief of the United Nations' nuclear watchdog is holding another round of necessary discussions with Russian officials on the potential creation of a protection zone surrounding Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, he said on Thursday. ""It’s key that the zone focuses solely on preventing a nuclear accident. I am continuing my efforts towards this goal with a sense of utmost urgency,"" said International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi.  He posted an image on social media of him shaking hands with the CEO of Russian nuclear power company Rosatom, Alexey Likhachev. The recent movement of Belarusian armed forces is not part of a plan to get involved in Russia's war in Ukraine, President Alexander Lukashenko said on Thursday. ""We have been having and are having exercises. Now they are more extensive because of the current situation and threats. Therefore, we are conducting exercises on our territory,"" said Lukashenko, according to a statement published on his official website. ""That's it. No other intent, no conspiracy,"" he added. Earlier in December, Belarus announced snap military drills across the country and a Russian delegation led by Russian President Vladimir Putin traveled to Belarus to meet Lukashenko. This sparked speculation that Putin might try to convince Lukashenko to help him in the war against Ukraine. Belarus shares a 674-mile border with Ukraine. Belarusian territory was used as a platform by Russian troops during the invasion in February, but the country's troops have so far not taken part in the conflict. Recent troop movements were a response to increased tensions, said Lukashenko. ""We cannot rule out that aggression may be deployed against our country,"" he said. ""At least, we see such a readiness on the part of our neighbors."" The White House believes President Zelensky made a ""very compelling"" case to the American public and to lawmakers about the need for sustained US aid to Ukraine, a senior White House official said. As the White House prepares for Republicans — some of whom have cast doubt on the future of aid to Ukraine — to take over the House, the official said the White House believes Zelensky's speech helped make the case. ""We think he made a compelling case to lawmakers and to the American people about the sacrifices that Ukraine has been and continues to make,"" a senior White House official said. ""We believe he made a very compelling case for the reason why support has been so critical in the past and how he believes that support."" While the speech may help the White House in Ukraine funding fights to come, the official said Zelensky didn't seek help from the White House for his remarks. ""This was all him,"" the official said. Zelensky, of course, went further than the White House in his appeals for more aid —  making clear in a joking-not-joking tone at both the White House and to Congress that current aid levels are still not enough. That was no surprise to the White House, which expected Zelensky was ""going to ask for more."" The surprise would have been if he had not. Just as he did in response to a question by CNN's Phil Mattingly, Biden has made clear to officials following his meeting with Zelensky how beneficial it was for him to meet with the Ukrainian leader in person. The senior official said Biden ""really enjoyed his time with Zelensky"" and found him to be ""energetic"" and dedicated. ##Zelensky## Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited Washington DC on Wednesday and made a historic speech from the US Capitol, expressing gratitude for American support in fighting Russian aggression since the war began — and asking for more. CNN spoke to members of the public throughout Ukraine to gauge their reaction to Zelensky's visit and the way he was received by US lawmakers. Mariya Hrachova, marketing director, Kyiv Hrachova told CNN that she is always moved by Zelensky's speeches, and Wednesday was no different. ""When he spoke to the House of Representatives, the way he looked, he didn't wear a suit, he was himself,"" she said. ""He spoke the truth, he said what he wanted, what he had to say, I admire that."" His reception was ""very touching,"" said Hrachova, who underlined the effectiveness of the visit in ""bringing back weapons and hundreds of millions of dollars in aid,"" even if more will be needed in future. ""We understand that will need to increase,"" said Hrachova. ""I know that there are various views in the American establishment about the situation in Ukraine and US support for Ukraine, but we hope that the majority in the government and in the Congress will support us."" Tetyana Vasylivna, fruit seller, Kyiv Vasylivna, who is originally from Kherson, also hailed Zelensky's visit to Washington. ""It seems to me that this visit will bring the end of the war closer,"" she said. ""I think this trip will help us to get victory.""  ""I really had tears in my eyes when I see in such a good way he (Zelensky) was welcomed,"" she said. ""He is doing a great job as a president, really great, I have no other words to describe him."" Oleksandr Kuzmenko, computer graphics, Kyiv Kuzmenko also lent his support to Zelensky, saying that it was important that US lawmakers heard about the situation on the ground directly from the Ukrainian president, rather than from a third party. ""I'd say he put it across very well, both in terms of messaging and choreography,"" he said. ""It was a good way to emphasize all the points and ask for weapons.""  Kuzmenko said that he supports Zelensky's key messages, and believes the Russian invasion has shown the shortcomings of existing world institutions. ""The current world security architecture is ineffective, and we are the reason it needs to be rebuilt, because of our sacrifice,"" he said. ""If we let it pass, it won't be us having to sort ... out this mess, it will be for our children and grandchildren,"" added Kuzmenko. Оleksandr Solonko, Ukrainian serviceman, near Bakhmut While Solonko didn't manage to watch Zelensky's speech in Washington, he believes that the visit is a positive. ""Such visits do not happen by chance. For us, this is an indicator of the commitment of the United States and that we will continue to be supported,"" he said.  ""We, the military, are doing our job and expect our government to make progress towards obtaining the necessary weapons and other means to help us drive the occupiers from our land."" It is also part of ""the symbolic war,"" said Solonko. ""What will happen behind the scenes of the visit, apart from military cooperation and economic support, is also interesting,"" he said. ""There are probably many more issues that need to be discussed between the representatives of our countries."" ##Zelensky## Neither US President Joe Biden nor his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky showed ""a potential willingness to listen to Russia's concerns"" during Zelensky's historic visit to the United States on Wednesday, according to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov.  ""So far, we can state with regret the fact that neither Biden nor Zelensky has spoken any words that can be perceived as a potential willingness to listen to Russia's concerns,"" Peskov said Thursday. At no point was Zelensky issued with a warning ""against continuing the barbaric shelling of residential buildings in the settlements of Donbas,"" said Peskov. Donbas blankets much of eastern Ukraine, and has been the front line of the country’s conflict with Moscow since 2014. Peskov added that ""there were no real calls for peace."" But during his address to the US Congress on Wednesday, Zelensky did stress that ""we need peace,"" reiterating the 10-point plan for peace devised by Ukraine.  He also called on US lawmakers to ""strengthen sanctions"" against Russia to make the country ""feel how ruinous its aggression truly is."" Peskov told journalists, however, that Wednesday's meeting showed the US is continuing to wage a proxy war of ""indirect fighting"" against Russia down ""to the last Ukrainian."" ##Zelensky## The US supplying Ukraine with Patriot missile systems will prolong the Ukrainian people's ""suffering,"" said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Thursday. ""We see that, in fact, the United States and other countries are following the path of constantly expanding the range and raising the technical level of the weapons that they supply to Ukraine,"" Peskov said during a conference call. ""This does not contribute to a speedy settlement of the situation, on the contrary."" Peskov went on to say this will not prevent Russia from achieving its goals in Ukraine. ""This leads to the fact that, unfortunately, the suffering of the Ukrainian people will continue longer than it could have,"" he added. On Tuesday, the US announced a new aid package to Ukraine, which included the ""first-ever transfer to Ukraine of the Patriot Air and Missile Defense System, capable of bringing down cruise missiles, short-range ballistic missiles, and aircraft at a significantly higher ceiling than previously provided air defense systems."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Wednesday that the Patriot air defense missile systems would be a ""very important step"" to creating secure airspace. ##Zelensky## The West supplying Ukraine with military support and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s visit to Washington further demonstrates that ""the collective West is set for a long confrontation with Russia,"" said a spokeswoman for Russia's foreign ministry. Maria Zakharova went on to talk about the ""monstrous crimes"" of the ""regime in Kyiv,"" adding that no matter how much the West helps arm the Ukrainian government, ""they will achieve nothing."" ""As the leadership of our country has stated, the tasks set within the framework of the special military operation will be fulfilled, taking into account the situation on the ground and the actual realities,"" Zakharova added, referring to Russia's war in Ukraine, which it calls a special operation.  Her comments came after Zelensky delivered a historic speech from the US Capitol, expressing gratitude for American support in fighting Russian aggression since the war began — and asking for more. Russian President Vladimir Putin called Israeli Prime Minister-designate Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday to congratulate him on the formation of a new government and to discuss the situations in Ukraine and Iran, according to a statement from Netanyahu's office.  ""The two leaders discussed a number of issues, chief among them the war in Ukraine,"" the statement said.  ""Prime Minister-designate Netanyahu told President Putin that he hopes a way will be found as soon as possible to end the war and the suffering caused by it."" ""Prime Minister-designate Netanyahu told President Putin that he is determined to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and to curb its attempts to establish a military base on our northern border,"" Netanyahu's office added. On Wednesday, Netanyahu officially informed Israeli President Isaac Herzog that he had successfully formed a government. Netanyahu, who had already served as prime minister for 15 years until being ousted last year, had until midnight local time (5 p.m. ET) Wednesday to form the government following elections on November 1. In what was a last minute announcement, Netanyahu tweeted 10 minutes before the deadline expired: “I have managed.” Volodymyr Zelensky's visit to Washington showed that neither the United States nor the Ukrainian president are ""ready for peace,"" Russia's ambassador to the US claimed Wednesday.   His comments came after Zelensky delivered a historic speech from the US Capitol, expressing gratitude for American support in fighting Russian aggression since the war began — and asking for more. The Biden administration's ""conciliatory statements about the lack of intention to start a confrontation with Russia are just empty words,"" Ambassador Anatoly Antonov said in a statement distributed by the Russian Embassy that decried what he described as Zelensky's ""Hollywood-style trip.""  ""What was essentially announced to applauses and sarcastic smirks, was the need to continue the 'proxy war' against our country,"" Antonov said. ""Till a full victory over us.""  Ambassador's warning: Speaking alongside Zelensky earlier Wednesday, President Joe Biden announced the US will send Kyiv a Patriot missile defense system as part of an additional $1.8 billion assistance package to Ukraine. Antonov said Biden's announcement came despite Russia warning the US against providing the system to Ukraine. “I think everyone understands perfectly well what fate the personnel, manning these complexes on the territory of Ukraine, can face,” he said. The Russian ambassador also warned that US involvement in Ukraine could lead to an intensification of the conflict. “The provocative actions by the US are steadily leading to an escalation, the consequences of which cannot even be imagined,” he said. ##Zelensky## If ever a leader personified their nation, it is Volodymyr Zelensky. Unbroken, defiant, a civilian forced to don green military garb, the Ukrainian president spent Wednesday in Washington, DC, on his daring first trip out of his country since Russia's brutal, unprovoked invasion in February. He expressed heartfelt gratitude for America's multi-billion dollar weapons and ammunition lifeline — but made clear he'd never stop asking for more. Appearing with extraordinary symbolism at the White House with President Joe Biden and before a joint meeting of Congress, Zelensky also bore sobering news. A long, bloody battle for freedom, democracy, and ultimately, the survival of a nation Russian President Vladimir Putin says has no right to exist — a fight for which it's still not clear the free world has the stomach — is nowhere near over. The comic actor-turned-wartime hero effectively put the fate of millions of Ukrainians in the hands of American lawmakers, taxpayers and families at a time when there is growing skepticism among the incoming Republican House majority about the cost of US involvement. At an emotional peak of his speech in the House chamber, Zelensky handed Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Vice President Kamala Harris a Ukrainian flag he retrieved from the hottest battle front at Bakhmut on Tuesday. ""Our heroes ... asked me to bring this flag to you, to the US Congress, to members of the House of Representatives and senators whose decisions can save millions of people,"" he said. ""So, let these decisions be taken. Let this flag stay with you.""

She said Zelensky’s historic address “strengthened both Democrats and Republicans who understand what is at stake in this fight against Putin and Russian aggression and now with their ally, Iran, as well.” “I also think no one is asking for a blank check,” Clinton added. “I believe that the Ukrainians have proven that they are a really good investment for the United States. They are not asking us to be there to fight their war. They’re fighting it themselves. They’re asking us and our allies for the means to not only defend themselves but to actually win.” Read more here. ##Zelensky## A former director of Russia's space agency was wounded by Ukrainian shelling in eastern Ukraine on Wednesday, according to state-run news agency TASS.  Ex-Roscomos head Dmitry Rogozin, who now leads a team of Russian military volunteers in the Donbas region, was taken to hospital with a back wound after his hotel in Donetsk came under shelling, his aide told TASS.  ""His life is not in danger,"" the aide said. The strike in the Russian-occupied city killed at least two people and injured several more, TASS reported.  ""Evidently, it was a targeted strike,"" Rogozin's aide said, claiming the shelling came from a 155mm self-propelled artillery system.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky delivered a historic speech from the United States Capitol Wednesday night, expressing gratitude for American support in fighting Russian aggression since the war began — and asking for more. “I hope my words of respect and gratitude resonate in each American heart,” Zelensky said during the joint meeting of Congress, later adding, “Against all odds, and doom and gloom scenarios, Ukraine didn’t fall. Ukraine is alive and kicking.” But alongside Zelensky’s gratitude was a plea, emphasizing that his armed forces are outnumbered and outgunned by the Russian military even as they fight on. At one point, Zelensky drew laughs from the chamber when he said, “We have artillery, yes. Thank you. We have it. Is it enough? Honestly, not really.” On “the front line of tyranny,” Zelensky argued, American support “is crucial not just to stand in such fight but to get to the turning point to win on the battlefield.” “The world is too interconnected and too interdependent to allow someone to stay aside and at the same time to feel safe when such a battle continues,” he added. “Our two nations are allies in this battle and next year will be a turning point, I know it — the point where Ukrainian courage and American resolve must guarantee the future of our common freedom, the freedom of people who stand for their values.” “Your money is not charity,” he asserted. “It’s an investment in the global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way.” Read more here. ##Zelensky## Volodymyr Zelensky's historic visit to the United States went well and he is ""pleased"" with the outcome, a source close to the Ukrainian president told CNN’s Jake Tapper. ""His meetings with President [Joe] Biden were sincere and supportive. The Joint session was great and he felt real bipartisan support,"" the source said.  Speaking to Congress Wednesday, Zelensky spoke of the strong ties between the US and his country, while giving a message of hope to Ukrainians at home. He also called for continued financial support from US lawmakers, saying: ""Your money is not charity. It is an investment in the global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way.""  ##Zelensky## Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday spoke of the strong ties between the United States and his country, while giving a message of hope to Ukrainians at home. Here are five key quotes from his historic speech at Capitol Hill: Zelensky called for continued financial support from the US, telling Congress: ""Your money is not charity. It is an investment in the global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way.""
Zelensky urged lawmakers to strengthen sanctions against Russia and ""let the terrorists be held responsible for aggression."" He noted that US President Joe Biden supported his 10-point peace plan, but added that each member of Congress can assist in the implementation.
The Russians ""use everything"" against Ukrainian cities such as Bakhmut, but Ukraine ""holds its lines and will never surrender,"" Zelenksy said to roaring applause. ""Last year, 70,000 people lived there in Bakhmut... Now only a few civilians stay. Every inch of that land is soaked in blood... Donbas changed hands several times in fierce combat, and even hand-fighting. But the Ukrainian Donbas stands,"" he said.
Zelensky said Ukrainians will celebrate Christmas this year, despite the atrocities of the war, telling Congress: ""Even if there is no electricity the light of our faith in ourselves will not be put out.""
Zelensky ended his speech by saying Ukraine will achieve ""absolute victory,"" reiterating his strong opening comments, which said: ""Ukraine is alive and kicking."" ##Zelensky## The US announced this week that it is providing a Patriot missile battery to Ukraine — but experts say that while it will be a valuable addition to the beleaguered country’s air defense, it’s not a cure-all. Retired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling, former commander of US Army Europe, told CNN that there is likely some unrealistic expectations about what a Patriot battery will be able to do for Ukraine.  It won’t, for example, be available to use immediately after the US agrees to provide it — it takes months to train troops on how to use the complex system, Hertling said, adding that training US troops to serve as maintainers or repairmen takes around a year. And it won’t be able to provide blanket cover for the entire country. “These systems don’t pick up and move around the battlefield,” Hertling said. “You put them in place somewhere that defends your most strategic target, like a city, like Kyiv. If anyone thinks this is going to be a system that is spread across a 500-mile border between Ukraine and Russia, they just don’t know how the system operates.” Some context: Ukraine has repeatedly asked for the US Army’s Patriot — an acronym for Phased Array Tracking Radar for intercept on Target — system, as it is considered one of the most capable long-range air defense systems on the market. And though the US did not fulfill the request for the first 10 months of the war, a senior administration official told CNN that the “reality of what is going on” on the ground in Ukraine influenced their decision to do so. In recent weeks, the Russian military has increasingly attacked Ukraine’s power grid and infrastructure as winter approached and temperatures dropped. Read more here. On the last week before the Gregorian Christmas, the optics of Russia’s war in Ukraine have taken on a different dynamic and demonstrate that the battle is not only being fought on the frigid frontlines in Ukraine, but is also becoming something of a PR tit-for-tat. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has harnessed the media to become an ever-present figure on screens across the world, beaming himself into parliaments, conferences and even music festivals. Russian President Vladimir Putin, a past master of propaganda, is driving his own agenda through his absolute control of Russian state media. Comparisons between the two show a chasm that may reflect the larger narrative of the war. Last Friday, according to the Kremlin, Putin “spent all day working at the joint staff of military branches involved in the special military operation.” But the only images that emerged were of Putin at the head of a table of generals, dressed in a navy suit and tie, listening to military chiefs who kowtow to his every whim. There was no mention of a location for this meeting, no readout, nor did the President make any public comments. Zelensky, by contrast, broadcast his location to the world.

Netanyahu informs Israeli president he has formed government,2022-12-21,"Benjamin Netanyahu has officially informed Israeli President Isaac Herzog that he has successfully formed a government, his Likud party said Wednesday.  In what was a last minute announcement, Netanyahu tweeted 10 minutes before the deadline expired, ""I have managed."" Netanyahu, who had already served as prime minister for 15 years until being ousted last year, had until midnight local time (5 p.m. ET) Wednesday to form the government following elections on November 1. The new Israeli government will likely be the most right-wing in Israeli history, including people appointed to ministerial positions who were once considered to be on the extreme nationalist fringes of Israeli politics. Members of Netanyahu's Likud party are expected to fill some of the most important cabinet positions of foreign minister, defense minister and justice minister.  Itamar Ben Gvir, leader of the Jewish Power party, will take on the newly expanded public security role, renamed national security minister, overseeing police in Israel plus some police activity in the occupied West Bank.  Bezalel Smotrich, leader of the Religious Zionist party, has been named minister of finance, although he's also been given power to appoint the head of the Israeli military body, which among its duties handles border crossings and permits for Palestinians. Aryeh Deri, leader of the ultra-Orthodox party Shas, is expected to serve as both Interior Minister and Minister of Health, while a representative from United Torah Judaism, the other ultra-Orthodox party in the five-party coalition, is expected to be minister of housing. Not all ministerial positions had been announced as of Wednesday evening. Special legislation needs to be passed in the coming days before Deri, Ben Gvir and Smotrich can be sworn in. Deri needs a law to be passed so he can serve as a minister despite his criminal conviction for tax offenses. Ben Gvir needs legislation as his position expands the powers normally given to the public security minister, and Smotrich needs new legislation granting him ministerial power within the defense ministry.

"Opinion: What 2022's elections taught me about humanity, politics and 'magic sauce'",2022-12-20,"Liberal democracy was hanging on by a thread this year across the world as nations ranging in size from France to the Faroe Islands went to the polls to choose who would rule them. All too often, though, voters demonstrated a sharp turn to the right or, having little free choice, merely cemented in power ancestral dictators.   Over the course of this year, I've chronicled 30 national elections on five continents and four oceans -- beginning with France's presidential election in April and continuing through to Fiji and Tunisia last week. Each has had its own unique cast, but often seem to exhibit certain core principles -- object lessons for how people prosper or simply survive in the disparate corners of our planet. First were the game-changers -- nations and people that chose a substantial break with a past that didn't seem to have worked for them, or where leaders promised something better and were able to persuade voters that they had some sort of magic sauce.  Perhaps the top example this year has been Italy. Here, the country shed a consummate technocrat, Mario Draghi, previous longtime president of the European Central Bank, who as prime minister of Italy for 20 months had been piloting his country through the Covid-19 pandemic and away from the shoals of utter economic collapse. All while embracing the efforts of Ukraine to repel the Russian invasion, and its hopes of joining the European Union.  Even in Italy's breakneck turnovers of governments, it was a short-lived premiership. In July, Draghi resigned in disgust over his treatment at the hands of a parliament that was resisting his every move.  In his place, voters chose to install a toxic triumvirate of far-right extremists, led by Giorgia Meloni. Italy's first woman prime minister was at the helm of the most far-right government since the fascist era of Benito Mussolini. Meloni's fellow troika members were Matteo Salvini, a veteran right-wing extremist, and the 86-year-old four-time Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, an unabashed supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin.  Not long after Meloni's victory in Italy, at the other end of Europe, Swedish voters were going to the polls with equally dramatic results. They elected a rightist prime minister who needed the nationalist, firmly anti-immigrant Sweden Democrats to form a government -- a party whose leader Jimmie Akesson, in pre-election debate, had reportedly refused to choose between President Joe Biden and Putin.    The Putin factor    Halfway across the globe, Brazil's voters also appeared at first blush to be opting for an abrupt change in direction in October's election. Though in this case, it involved shedding right-wing demagogue Jair Bolsonaro and returning to power the far-left icon, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.  But it was a pyrrhic victory for ""Lula,"" as he is known. He was immediately confronted by a parliament with a majority held by the party still controlled by Bolsonaro -- a man whose campaign was reportedly supported by Donald Trump and Steve Bannon, and who is friendly with Putin. In short, don't count out Bolsonaro for a minute. A similar political bind had already developed in France. One hand giveth, the other taketh away as voters rewarded President Emmanuel Macron with a second five-year term in April, the first back-to-back repeat since Jacques Chirac two decades ago. But then weeks later in June, the same voters removed Macron's absolute majority in parliament. Instead, they turned over the role of power broker to the far-right icon Marine Le Pen, who Macron had twice defeated for the presidency. Le Pen has well-documented, close ties to Putin going back years. (She has also condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine, while advocating that sanctions on Russia should be removed). Coupled with the fourth consecutive victory by Hungary's firebrand Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Putin's staunchest ally within the European Union, the Kremlin leader has appeared to have cemented a powerful network of supporters on multiple continents.   The comebacks   All this was happening in deeply entrenched democracies. Elsewhere, in the face of broad international condemnation, several long-standing dictators or dynasties managed to cement their single-handed rule of their nations. In the November election in OPEC-member Equatorial Guinea, President Teodoro Obiang, the world's longest-ruling head of state with 43 years in office, won nearly 99% of the vote. Little wonder the US State Department concluded ""we have serious doubts about the credibility of the announced results."" Turning to Asia, voters in the Philippines who decades earlier shed the long,  kleptocratic rule of Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos, somewhat inexplicably returned their son Bongbong Marcos to power with a resounding victory in May.  His victory assured that Bongbong and his mother Imelda, now aged 93, would likely go unpunished for their family's stolen funds that are estimated to have risen as high as $10 billion during the Marcos' rule a half century ago. Philippine voters appear simply to be hoping that history won't repeat itself. Another of what I Iike to call franchise-holders was Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu. He managed to return to power in November's election with the help of far-right parties that both oppose statehood for Palestinian territories and embrace Israel extending its sovereignty throughout the West Bank.  One of his allies is Itamar Ben-Gvir, who's been promised the powerful National Security ministry. Ben-Gvir also happens to be the spiritual successor to the Jewish Defense League and its founder Meir Kahane, whose violent activities in New York in the 1960s led him to flee to Israel and form the anti-Arab Kach Party.    The wild cards    And then there are those who somehow managed to snatch victory following some very questionable campaign moves. Notable among these was Denmark's youngest female prime minister Mette Frederiksen. Her campaign was burdened by an ill-considered decision to exterminate the country's entire 17 million-strong mink population after a scare that the critters might be in a position to pass along Covid-19 mutations to humans.  Forced by the uproar to call an election seven months before her term ended, she managed to eke out a victory. This despite her actions costing Denmark almost $2 billion to compensate the mink farmers whose livelihood was impacted.  As for the Faroe Islands in the North Atlantic, it appears many there would love to break the final bonds that have tied them to Denmark since Napoleon, with the pro-independence People's Party fielding nearly 20% of votes in an election earlier this month. At the time England's Magna Carta first ushered in the concept of democratic choice, there were barely 300 million people in the world. This year, the global population hit 8 billion. Yet as I have chronicled this year, for the most part, democracy of one form or another still is not played out, as the defeat of election deniers in the US midterms suggested. My hope is that enough voters recognize the value of maintaining a system of free choice, even in the hardest of times, to keep democracy alive -- even if they do not always achieve the goal of tolerance, respect and cohesion.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",48,48.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.057,0.845,0.098,0.994,0.0,13.095599999999987,469.0,0.027922388059701465
Will Erdogan finally deliver on his vow to invade northern Syria?,2022-11-25,"Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has in the past week launched a series of airstrikes against Kurdish militants in northern Syria, and has warned that a ground operation will soon follow.   The aerial operation that began on Sunday and his warnings three days later come after an explosion rocked Istanbul a week ago, killing at least six people and injuring more than 80 others. Turkish officials blamed Kurdish separatists for the explosion, a claim denied by Kurdish groups.  Erdogan said the strikes were ""just the beginning"" and that the Turkish Armed Forces ""will topple the terrorists by land at the most convenient time.""     Earlier on Wednesday, the defense ministry claimed that 471 targets had been hit and that ""254 terrorists have been neutralized"" since the start of the assault, which has been dubbed ""Operation Claw-Sword."" CNN can't independently verify the number of casualties.  But Erdogan has been pledging an incursion into northern Syria since May. He had previously said that an invasion was meant to create a 30-km (20-mile) deep ""safe zone"" that would be emptied of fighters allied to the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a militant group that Turkey and the US deem a terrorist organization.  Analysts have said that Erdogan had stopped short of acting on his vow to invade because he hadn't secured a green light from Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose country has a large military presence in Syria.   But on Wednesday, senior Russian negotiator Alexander Lavrentyev said that Moscow has tried to convince Turkey to ""refrain from conducting full-scale ground operations.""    The northern Syrian area targeted by Erdogan includes the three key towns of Manbij, Tel Rifaat and Kobani, which are under the control of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).  The SDF, backed by Washington, had been instrumental in the fight against ISIS since 2014. But its backbone is the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) militia, which Turkey considers a wing of the PKK and seeks to eliminate.   CNN asked Soner Cagaptay, director of the Turkish Research Program at The Washington Institute, how likely the Turkish leader is to follow through with his pledge this time.   Turkey has been saying that it will begin its next incursion for months. Are today's claims any different or more serious?  I think that taking into consideration the previous Turkish incursions into northern Syria, this time, something doesn't seem to be moving forward as fast. Typically, Turkish incursions follow one or two days of cross-border shelling by artillery and drone strikes, and then the military moves in. This time, the cross-border artillery shelling and drone strikes have been going on almost for a week, and [there has been] no [ground] action. So that means something is missing.   How do you see the Kremlin's recent comments on a potential incursion? Do you see it as a green light?   Now usually, when Turkey goes into northern Syria, it needs to get a green light from two superpowers militarily present in Syria, that is the US and Russia.   But Russia is not aligned. I think Russia is wanting more before it green-lights a full-scale Turkish incursion. What Russia wants is for the Turkish government in Ankara to engage the Assad regime and to commit to ending the war, sort of in a global handshake. And of course, that kind of discussion will take days, if not weeks and months. So I think until we see that kind of discussion maturing and coming to a conclusion, Putin will not give his green light to a Turkish incursion.  Given the growing importance of Turkey to the West amid the Ukraine war, are Western states likely to turn a blind eye to an incursion?  The US has typically objected to Turkish incursions because they target the YPG. But the US has relied on the YPG to fight ISIS. So, it's never happy when Turkey targets the YPG.   But this time, things are different. [Firstly], the big strategic picture is changing. Turkey's importance [to] the US has shifted as US policy zooms out of the desert [Middle East], and focuses on the [Eurasian] steppe, or zooms out of Syria and into Ukraine.   So, the US view is that Turkey's strategic importance has increased. That's the long-term shift.   In the short term, there's also a tactical view [in] Washington, which is that Turkey has objected to NATO's Nordic expansion. I think Ankara has leveraged its hand well by raising objections to Sweden's accession. And so right now, Washington really doesn't want to irritate Turkey. And I think that applies to all key NATO allies.   Iran protests  Member states of the UN Human Rights Council on Thursday passed a resolution forming a fact-finding mission to probe Iran's human rights violations during nationwide protests over the past months.   The motion was called for by Germany and Iceland, and passed after 25 countries voted in favor, six voted against and 16 abstained during a special session held in Geneva.  China attempted to remove the article forming the fact-finding mission by submitting an unexpected amendment to the resolution, a move that drew harsh criticism and collapsed after 25 countries voted against it.   Iran's representative said the draft is ""completely biased in nature and substance and does not reflect the facts and realities.""   Here's the latest:  The Iranian government on Thursday set up a national committee to investigate deaths linked to the protest movement gripping the country, according to the deputy foreign minister. 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Chief Volker Turk said on Thursday that Iran is in a ""full-fledged human rights crisis."" 
An Iranian fan holding a football jersey with the name of Mahsa Amini was confronted by security staff on Friday at Iran's match against Wales in Qatar. 
Footballer Voria Ghaffouri was arrested on charges of ""dishonorable and insulting comportment towards Iran's national soccer team as well as incitement against the regime,"" according to state-aligned news agency Tasnim.    The digest    Netanyahu's party signs deal with far-right Jewish Power party  Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party in Israel said Friday it had signed a coalition deal with Itamar Ben Gvir's far right Jewish Power party -- the first agreement between Likud and another party as Netanyahu works to build a government. Ben Gvir will take up the newly created position of Minister of National Security and his party will receive a number of other posts.  Background: Ben Gvir's party, on a joint ticket with Religious Zionism, made major gains in November's election, helping secure Netanyahu's path to victory (the two parties have since split). Ben Gvir had been demanding the public security minister position for some time -- claiming Israel has lost control in the face of a wave of Palestinian attacks targeting Israelis. He showed up to the site of Wednesday's Jerusalem bomb blasts saying, ""We need to back up our soldiers and our policemen, return to targeted killings (of Palestinian militants), rule the state of Israel, deter terrorism and charge a price for it."" 
Why it matters: With this portfolio Ben Gvir will be in charge of police despite he himself having been in trouble with the law -- convicted of anti-Arab racism and supporting terrorism. He's also advocated a more permissive open-fire policy for police and soldiers to use against rioters throwing stones and incendiary devices. He also wants new legislation that would give police and soldiers immunity for crimes committed while on duty.    india and Gulf states to resume free trade talks covering food, energy security  India and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) have agreed to resume talks on a free trade agreement, India's Trade Minister Piyush Goyal said on Thursday, as his nation seeks closer ties with one of its largest trading partners, Reuters reported.  Background: These talks mark the third such attempt by India and the GCC to ink a trade pact, with negotiations previously held in 2006 and 2008. The GCC is a union of six countries in the Gulf region including Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Kuwait, Oman and Bahrain. 
Why it matters: The GCC is India's largest trading partner, Goyal said, with bilateral merchandise trade in 2021-22 standing at $154 billion and services trade at $14 billion. The GCC contributes almost 35% of India's oil imports and 70% of gas imports, he said, adding that bilateral talks will be held on a trade mechanism involving the Indian rupee and local Gulf currencies.    Cuban President meets with Erdogan during rare visit to Turkey  Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel met with his Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday during a rare official visit to Turkey, Reuters reported. The two men held bilateral talks and signed cooperation agreements in several sectors and the Cuban leader underlined his country's willingness to further improve relations with Ankara over energy, tourism and education.  Background: This is the first trip to Turkey by a Cuban leader in 27 years, according to Turkish media. Diaz-Canel recently began an international tour including Russia, Turkey, Algeria and China to seek economic support and cooperation in the energy sector. 
Why it matters: The communist-run country is facing severe energy shortages and hours-long blackouts, seeking to bolster its grid with international aid. Cuba has been under a US economic embargo since 1962 after the communist revolution led by Castro.     World Cup  The Welsh Football Association (FAW) said the sport's world governing body FIFA told the federation on Thursday that rainbow-colored flags and hats will be permitted in FIFA World Cup stadiums in Qatar.   A post on the FAW's official Twitter account reads, ""In response to the FAW, FIFA has confirmed that fans with Rainbow Wall bucket hats and rainbow flags will be allowed entry to the stadium for @Cymru's match against Iran on Friday. All World Cup venues have been contacted and instructed to follow the agreed rules & regulations.  ""The FAW urges FIFA to adhere to their message that everybody will be welcome in Qatar during the World Cup and continue to highlight any further human rights issues.

Israeli President invites Netanyahu to form government,2022-11-13,"Israel's President Isaac Herzog asked Benjamin Netanyahu to form a new government on Sunday, allowing the former prime minister to secure the country's top job for a record sixth time and extend his record as the nation's longest-serving leader. Netanyahu, who served 12 years as Prime Minister before losing office in 2021, was recommended by party leaders representing more than half of Israel's 120 parliament or Knesset members after the president concluded a political consultation with them. ""Israel's citizens require a stable and functioning government,"" he said in remarks after the closed-door meeting with Netanyahu. ""A government that serves all citizens of Israel, both those who supported and voted for it and those who opposed its establishment; a government that works on behalf of and for the sake of all shades of the Israeli mosaic, from all communities, sectors, faiths, religions, lifestyles, beliefs, and values, and that treats them all with sensitivity and responsibility."" ""Please God, it will be a stable, successful, and responsible government of all of the people of Israel,"" said Netanyahu, speaking alongside Herzog. ""We are brothers and we will live together side by side."" Israelis voted on November 1 for a fifth time in four years to break the political stalemate in the country. Netanyahu's Likud party has the most seats in the Knesset, and the former prime minister will have 28 days to form a coalition government, with the possibility of a two-week extension. But Netanyahu isn't in for an easy ride: he is now likely to lead an ever-polarized country and possibly one of the most right-wing governments in Israel's history. During negotiations, he will have to divide up ministries among his coalition partners and haggle over policies. This is where things get interesting. The five factions allied with Netanyahu's Likud have a four-seat majority in the 120-seat Knesset, or parliament, and failure to give any one of them what they want could provoke them to bring the coalition down. When it comes to the ultra-Orthodox parties, their demands are uncontroversial as far as Netanyahu is concerned: bigger budgets for religious schools, and the right not to teach their children secular subjects such as math and English. The real showdowns are likely to come with his new extreme right-wing allies. Netanyahu rode to power on the back of a stunning showing by the Religious Zionism/Jewish Power list, which, with 14 seats, is now the third-biggest grouping in the Knesset. Its leader, Itamar Ben Gvir, who has a conviction for inciting anti-Arab racism and supporting terrorism, has demanded to be made Public Security Minister, in charge of Israel's police. Ben Gvir's partner is Bezalel Smotrich, who has described himself as a ""proud homophobe."" He has said Israel should be run according to Jewish law. He has spoken of reducing the power of the Supreme Court, and striking out the crime of breach of trust -- which just so happens to be part of the indictments against Netanyahu in his ongoing corruption trials. Netanyahu has long denied all of the charges. If Smotrich wins the Justice Ministry he covets, he may be able to make these things happen, ending Netanyahu's legal worries. Yet these may be the least of his concerns. Having joined forces with the extreme right wing, the sixth reign of Netanyahu may end up further alienating the half of Israel that didn't vote for the bloc of parties backing him. Assuming Netanyahu can reach a coalition agreement by the December 11 deadline, the Knesset Speaker will call a confidence vote within seven days. If all goes to plan, his government will then take office.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",25,50.0,0.0605,0.7913571428571428,0.14814285714285716,0.3502642857142857,0.059,0.81,0.131,0.9887,8.756607142857142,89.56872380952379,481.0,0.18621356301356298
"Netanyahu to be invited to form government, paving way for return of Israel's longest-serving leader",2022-11-11,"Israel's President Isaac Herzog announced Friday he will invite Benjamin Netanyahu to form Israel's next government, paving the way for him to take the country's top job for a record sixth time and extend his record as the nation's longest-serving leader. Herzog will officially issue the mandate to Netanyahu on Sunday, he said. Herzog made the announcement after meeting with all the factions in parliament, the Knesset, to ask who they would back for prime minister. In a statement released by his office, he said: ""At the end of the round of consultations, 64 members of the Knesset recommended to the president the chairman of the Likud faction, MK Benjamin Netanyahu."" He added that 28 Knesset members recommended outgoing Prime Minister Yair Lapid. The same number chose not to recommend anyone.  Herzog will meet with Netanyahu at the president's residence on Sunday to formally give him the mandate. Under Israeli law, Netanyahu will then have 28 days to form a new government, with the possibility of a 14-day extension if required.  During negotiations, Netanyahu will have to divide up ministries among his coalition partners and haggle over policies. This is where things get interesting. With a four-seat majority in the 120-seat Knesset, or parliament, the five factions allied with Netanyahu's Likud are all potential kingmakers: fail to give any one of them what they want, and they could bring the coalition down.

Yet these may be the least of his concerns. Having been forced to join forces with the extreme right wing, the sixth reign of Netanyahu may end up further alienating the half of Israel that didn't vote for the bloc of parties backing him. Restrictions on settlements in the occupied West Bank could be loosened, prompting international condemnation. Violence between Israelis and Palestinians in the West Bank could worsen; 2022 has already seen more people killed on each side than any time since 2015.  Then there's the potentially explosive issue of the Jerusalem holy site known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as the Ḥaram al-Sharīf, or Noble sanctuary. Under the status quo, only Muslims are allowed to pray at the compound. Ben Gvir advocates allowing Jews to pray at what is their holiest site. Any change could be used as a pretext by Palestinian militants to carry out attacks. It would almost certainly be condemned by Israel's new friends in the Arab world, such as Morocco, the UAE and Bahrain. President Herzog himself summed up the issue when a hot mic caught him telling Netanyahu's allies in the Shas party: ""You're going to have a problem with the Temple Mount. That's a critical issue. You have a partner that the entire world is anxious about,"" an apparent reference to Ben Gvir. Herzog told another of Netanyahu's allies, Avi Maoz of the avowedly anti-LGBT Noam faction: ""There has been concern about things you have said about the LGBT community. All human beings were created in God's image and we must respect everyone. We have only one State of Israel. That pertains also to your party."" Could a Netanyahu-led government have disputes with the United States? Netanyahu may not have the same bromance with President Joe Biden as he did with Donald Trump, but the two men seem to get along. ""We are brothers,"" Biden told Netanyahu in a call after the election. ""My commitment to Israel is unquestionable. Congratulations, my friend."" Netanyahu replied: ""We will bring more historic peace agreements [with the Arab world], that is within reach. My commitment to our alliance and our relationship is stronger than ever.""    Netanyahu is vehemently against the US rejoining the Iran nuclear deal, but that seems off the table for now. On Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and Israel's reluctance to provide Kyiv with defensive weapons, Netanyahu promised President Volodymyr Zelensky to ""seriously examine"" the issue.  Assuming Netanyahu can reach a coalition agreement by the December 11 deadline, the Knesset Speaker will call a confidence vote within seven days. If all goes to plan, Bibi's government will then take office, perhaps on December 18 -- in time for Hanukkah, the Jewish festival of lights (and miracles).","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",46,51.0,0.05872727272727272,0.848090909090909,0.0931818181818182,0.22985384615384616,0.052,0.846,0.101,0.989,10.573276923076923,93.31100073260072,205.0,0.4551756133297596
Gulf Arab states can't give up oil. But they can slash their emissions,2022-11-11,"As Western states try to wean themselves off their addiction to hydrocarbons, Gulf oil nations have been pushing back hard, warning that a hasty transition away from fossil fuels will be counterproductive.  But as they tell the world that it cannot live without the natural resource that has brought them enormous wealth, the Gulf states are embarking on their own ambitious clean energy projects.  Some of the world's largest hydrocarbon producers and exporters, Gulf countries are also among the globe's biggest polluters. Gas-rich Qatar and oil-wealthy Saudi Arabia have some of the heaviest carbon footprints on the planet. According to the World Bank, Qatar had the highest carbon emissions per capita as of 2019, followed by Kuwait, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.   The Gulf monarchies are trying to change that, investing billions in the renewable energy sector, a plan that allows them to save more of their hydrocarbons for export to an energy-hungry world.  Analysts say the move is more than a publicity stunt in a world where hydrocarbons are increasingly stigmatized. It is pragmatic, they say.   ""The Gulf states are making net zero domestic targets in some ways to increase their hydrocarbon assets for export, to take advantage of a window of opportunity of those products as demand is expected to gradually decline,"" said Karen Young, senior research scholar at Columbia's Center on Global Energy Policy.  Their push for going green at home also helps them battle their longstanding image of being heavy polluters, said Rafiq Latta, senior correspondent at Energy Intelligence, an energy information company.   ""The last thing the Gulf states want is to appear dirty,"" Latta told CNN, ""So they are investing heavily in green energy,"" which also opens avenues for business as the green energy industry gains global traction.  So, investment in clean energy projects and renewables ""makes very good business sense and PR sense for the Gulf,"" he said.  Gulf petro-states are warning against a quick transition away from hydrocarbons, with the UAE calling for a ""mixed energy"" approach that minimizes emissions without cutting hydrocarbons.  The UAE is one of the biggest oil exporters, but has made renewable and green energy a priority, arguing that clean and dirty energy are complementary, not competing.  That view of the symbiotic relationship between the two types of energies that the UAE believes in is perhaps best demonstrated by Sultan Al Jaber, the CEO of the nation's main oil company ADNOC, who also happens to be the government's climate envoy. He has argued that by 2050, the world will need to produce 30% more energy than today.  ""The world needs all the solutions it can get,"" he said at an energy summit in Abu Dhabi last month. ""It is not oil or gas or solar or wind or nuclear or hydrogen. It is oil and gas and solar and wind ... It is all of the above.""   The UAE was the first Middle Eastern state to add nuclear power to its energy mix 14 years ago and the first to set a net-zero emissions goal, by 2050. The Gulf state is home to the headquarters of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and is due to host next year's COP28 climate summit.  Saudi Arabia, which has its own climate program, followed by announcing a net zero carbon emissions target of 2060. On Monday, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said that his $620 billion wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund, will also target net zero emissions by 2050, adding that the kingdom will contribute $2.5 billion to the Middle East Green Initiative, which aims to reduce carbon emissions from regional hydrocarbon production by more than 60%.  This month, the United States and the UAE signed a memorandum that aims to mobilize $100 billion on clean energy projects that would ""accelerate toward a goal of deploying 100 gigawatts of clean energy by 2035."" One gigawatt can power about 300,000 homes.  ""The world will still have demand for oil and the Gulf approach, at least in Saudi and UAE, is to produce a cleaner oil product that emits less carbon from flaring and that is more efficient in extraction methods,"" said Young, ""And they are doing that.""  The flaring of natural gas is a by-product of oil production, and the waste contributes to severe air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.  Speaking to CNN's Becky Anderson on Tuesday during the COP27 climate summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, the UAE's minister of climate change and environment Mariam Almheiri said that the Gulf state has been working toward ""a just energy transition."".   ""We are ramping up our renewables and at the same time decarbonizing our oil and gas sector,"" Almheiri told CNN, adding that the UAE now offers some of the lowest carbon footprint oil barrels in the world.  Much of the hydrocarbons exported by Gulf states go to some of the world's biggest consumers and polluters, including China and India.   Gulf states are however not directly responsible for the carbon footprints left by their consumers, and analysts say it's unrealistic to advocate for a cut in oil and gas extraction and export, as it would be detrimental to GCC economies.   ""They've got their own self-interest to look after, and clearly it would be economic suicide to advocate for a radical shift away from oil and gas,"" said Latta.   ""The turkey is not going to vote for Christmas, and the lamb is not going to vote for Eid, so I don't see the Gulf en masse moving or accelerating away from hydrocarbons any time soon,"" said Latta.   The UAE's mantra of ""maximum energy, minimum emissions"" calls for a combined energy supply in a slow and gradual energy transition to avoid a shock to the global economy.    While it is in their self-interest, ""GCC states have first a responsibility to their citizens, and that means they must generate revenue,"" said Young. ""Right now, the easiest and most efficient way to generate state revenue is to sell oil and gas. So that's what they will keep doing.""  Iran protests  At least 18 people, including two children, were killed in last Friday's protests in the city of Khash, in Iran's Sistan and Baluchistan province, said Amnesty International on Thursday.   ""This latest deadly incident in Sistan and Baluchistan province reveals that protesters from the oppressed Baluchi minority have borne the brunt of the security forces' particularly vicious crackdown on demonstrations,"" the human rights organization added.    Last week, protests turned violent in several cities in the province in southeast Iran, state media and activists said. Sistan and Baluchistan, which neighbors Pakistan and Afghanistan, is home to the long-oppressed Baluch ethnic minority and has a history of unrest with armed groups carrying out attacks against Iranian security personnel.  The deadly protests are part of a wider nationwide movement gripping Iran in recent weeks.  Here is the latest:  Iran's foreign minister on Thursday criticized his German counterpart after she tweeted a message of support for anti-government demonstrators on Wednesday. 
Leading Iranian actress Taraneh Alidoosti posted a picture of herself on Instagram without the mandatory hijab to show support for the  protests. 
The Iranian government labeled London-based news channel Iran International as a ""terrorist organization,""  the state-aligned news agency ISNA reported Tuesday, citing the country's information ministry.  
Iranian forces then arrested a journalist from Iran International, ISNA reported  Thursday. ISNA, referring to journalist Elham Afkari as an ""agent,"" reported that she was arrested Thursday by the Ministry of Intelligence while trying to ""flee the country."" Iranian officials have identified Afkari as the sister of famous Iranian wrestler Navid Afkari, who was executed two years ago, according to the state news agency IRNA.  The digest  FIFA announces shared flights for Israeli and Palestinian football fans for 2022 World Cup  FIFA, football's world governing body, announced on Thursday that shared flights have been organized to permit Israeli and Palestinian fans into Qatar to watch the 2022 FIFA World Cup.    Background: In FIFA's press release, the organization's president Gianni Infantino said, ""We are delighted that an agreement has been reached for Israeli and Palestinian fans to visit Qatar and attend matches during the FIFA World Cup. With this deal, Israelis and Palestinians will be able to fly together and enjoy football together."" Qatar does not have diplomatic relations with Israel, but a temporary consular services office will be set up during the tournament to handle Israeli visitors. More than the 8,000 Palestinians and 3,800 Israelis have bought tickets for the tournament, a source briefed on the matter, but not authorized to speak publicly, told CNN.  
Why it matters: The temporary charter flights between Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv and Hamad International Airport in Doha, Qatar, represent the only official direct flights between the two nations. Two Gulf Arab states neighboring Qatar, the UAE and Bahrain, signed historic normalization agreements with Israel in 2020, but despite direct flights for the World Cup, a Qatari official told CNN that the country's stance on normalization ""has not changed.""   Lawyer of British-Egyptian hunger striker refused prison entry, authorities say he is in ""good health""  Khaled Ali, a lawyer representing jailed British-Egyptian activist Alaa Abd El-Fattah, tweeted Thursday that despite a permit, he was denied entry to Wadi Al Natroun prison to visit his client amid mounting concerns over Abd El-Fattah's deteriorating health. On the same day, Egypt's Public Prosecution said in a statement that a medical report shows jailed British-Egyptian writer and activist Alaa Abd El-Fattah is in ""good health.""  Background: The Public Prosecution said it has ordered the formation of a medical committee to look into Abd El-Fattah's health condition following a request by his attorney earlier this month to move him to a medical center. The Public Prosecution said in the statement that the medical report ""concluded that Abd El Fattah is in good health and doesn't require moving to a medical center and recommended regular follow up."" Abd El-Fattah, a leading activist in the country's 2011 uprising who has been imprisoned several times over nine years, escalated a more than 200-day hunger strike on Sunday as he stopped drinking water.  Why it matters: The family of Abd El-Fattah said Thursday that Egyptian authorities had intervened medically after the activist stopped drinking water, and urged British authorities to get information about his health status.    It'll be Bibi: Israel's president to invite Netanyahu to form next government   Israel's President Isaac Herzog announced Friday he will invite Benjamin Netanyahu to form the country's next government.

Opinion: What Europe makes of America's election result,2022-11-09,"On newspaper stands across the French capital and online, the early results of America's national elections were quite evident Wednesday morning.   The world -- or at least the slice of it that continues to embrace the political system called democracy -- has breathed a tentative sigh of relief.  While some key results may remain unresolved for some days, with the red wave reduced to a stream, America appears to have rejected the sharp turn toward the right that has marked so many other national elections this year.  Or as France's leading newspaper Le Monde put the uncertainty over Congress: ""A bad surprise for Republicans.""  In many cases, the political leanings of the various European media affected the way the results were played. For example, France's center-right daily Le Figaro splashed across its homepage early Wednesday a victory photo of Donald Trump acolyte J.D. Vance in Ohio, while conceding, ""Contrary to the expectations of Donald Trump's party, a red wave does not seem to be emerging in the United States. The Democrats resisted, notably with a senatorial victory in Pennsylvania."" In London, The Times, owned by one-time Trump ally Rupert Murdoch, led its homepage with a video of an exultant Democrat John Fetterman flipping the Republican-held Senate seat in Pennsylvania, observing: ""Congress race goes to wire as Trump candidates falter."" One central question on the ballot in a number of states -- whether to preserve the right to an abortion in their constitutions in the wake of a US Supreme Court decision that many here in Paris have been telling me for weeks they find difficult to understand -- was also noted in foreign media coverage of Tuesday's elections.  As French television network TF1 put it Wednesday morning: ""Three states inscribed the right to abortion in their constitutions.""  It's worth pointing out just how far from the norm the American electorate seems to be veering in its absence of a strong right-wing drift Tuesday.  In such European nations as Italy and Sweden, right-wing parties have surged to power in national elections. Not to mention in Israel where Benjamin ""Bibi"" Netanyahu last week swept to a return in coalition with hard-right religious parties that gained historically large votes.  In France, while centrist President Emmanuel Macron managed to eke out a second term last Spring, he lost control of the National Assembly as the right-wing National Front won its largest number of seats in history. Indeed, the cover of this week's French news magazine Le Point led with photos of France's two politically extreme leaders -- far-left Jean-Luc Mélenchon and rightist Marine Le Pen, with the headline: ""The Accomplices (And in the end, it's Le Pen who wins)."" In the blurb beneath, it added: ""Spain, Sweden, Italy ... the populist wave of the right.""  In Brazil, while leftist Luiz Inácio ""Lula"" da Silva last month won a narrow victory over far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro, the outgoing president still managed to win control of parliament and the nation's largest state governments.  Still, there were some international reporters prepared to see a glimmer of hope for Republicans and a brake on Democratic euphoria. Nirmal Ghosh, US Bureau Chief for Singapore's Straits Times, pointed to the glass-half-empty scenario that even a slim ""Republican majority in [the] House will constrain Biden, may set stage for Trump's return bid in 2024."" The greatest fear, especially in Europe, also seemed to be largely tamed -- that a Congress firmly in control of Trump Republicans would abandon America's unyielding and unequivocal support for Ukraine in its struggle with Russia.  Indeed, many of Russian President Vladimir Putin's supporters in Moscow were hoping that, as Reuters put it, ""US midterms will mean less Ukraine aid and more chaos.""  Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky was direct. American politicians need  to show ""unwavering unity,"" he said, at least ""until peace is restored.""  As for the Kremlin, the first reaction from Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov was, as he told reporters on Wednesday: ""These elections are important, but the significance of these elections for the future in the short and medium term of our bilateral relations [cannot] be seriously exaggerated. These elections cannot change anything essential. Relations still exist and will remain bad.""  One clear signal that Russia will not be deterred from Putin's confrontational approach to the US was the disclosure Wednesday morning that WNBA star Brittney Griner, imprisoned in Russia since February, is being moved to a penal colony. As the Washington Post reported, this is ""a type of prison facility known for its brutal living conditions."" Indeed, especially given Peskov's comments, it's hard to see the Biden administration's efforts to win Griner's freedom bearing fruit anytime soon. The election comes at a pivotal moment not just for geopolitics but the future of our planet. In Egypt, the global climate conference COP27 is underway, with tens of thousands of delegates from across the world attending. Now, new life has been breathed into Biden's pledge that ""the United States will encourage countries -- particularly major economies -- and the private sector to...  help close the gap between current pledges and what the latest science tells us is urgently needed.""   The principal fear from most European officials I've talked with Wednesday morning, as it has been from the very moment of Biden's victory in November 2020, is that his tenure may be simply a brief, if welcome, interregnum rather than a definitive change in direction from the Trump years.  Many Europeans in particular remain fixated on Trump's remarks earlier this week that suggested on November 15 he would be announcing his candidacy for president in 2024.  It's hard to see from this perspective across the pond that there will be any real relief until Americans have demonstrated they have really put behind them this era that has been so deeply destructive of the entire trans-Atlantic relationship.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",35,53.0,0.0,0.813,0.187,0.6486,0.05,0.862,0.088,0.9835,22.700999999999997,126.74683406593404,240.0,0.5281118086080585
How a rule change helped Netanyahu win Israel's elections,2022-11-07,"Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu owes his victory in last week's Israeli elections partly to a change in election rules promoted by the political opponents he is now shutting out of power, CNN analysis of the November 1 results shows.    Netanyahu and his allies are set to have a small but clear majority of seats in parliament, the Knesset, but they won the popular vote by only a razor-thin margin.    One reason his Knesset majority is bigger than his popular vote victory is that three parties in the outgoing Knesset each got less than 3.25% of the popular vote -- so they get no seats in the new parliament.    The irony of the situation is that it was Avigdor Liberman of the Yisrael Beiteinu party and Yair Lapid of Yesh Atid who pushed to raise the threshold from 2% to 3.25% in 2014, when they were political allies of Netanyahu and in government with him.    Partly because of the rule change they wanted, they're now part of the outgoing coalition that he defeated. The Lapid-Liberman coalition would have gained seats if the threshold was still 2%.   Another reason Netanyahu won decisively is that two small parties in the anti-Netanyahu camp didn't join forces with bigger parties, one of Israel's leading pollsters said.   If the left-wing Meretz party had run on a joint ticket with Labor, and the Arab party Balad had not broken away from the Joint List party they ran with last time, then Tuesday's election would have produced a 60-60 deadlock, Camil Fuchs, a leading Israeli pollster, told CNN Monday.    Both parties failed to cross the threshold: Meretz won 3.2% of the popular vote and Balad took 2.9%. Together they drew less than 300,000 votes.   All the votes for those parties were effectively discarded.   The popular vote was extremely close.   If all the votes for the parties in the outgoing Knesset are counted, Netanyahu and his allies come out less than 40,000 votes ahead of their opponents, out of more than 4.7 million votes cast.    There were 40 parties running in the November 1 election, of which 13 got more than 0.5% of the popular vote.    Five of those 13 -- Likud, Religious Zionism/Jewish Power, Shas, United Torah Judaism, and Jewish Home -- are on the pro-Netanyahu side of Israel's political divide. Together they took 49.6% of the popular vote, final results from the Central Election Committee show -- about 2.36 million votes.      The other eight are anti-Netanyahu and took 48.9% of the popular vote, or about 2.33 million votes -- a difference of 0.7 percentage points, or just over 30,000 votes.   The exact number of votes per party will be certified on November 9.  But the electoral threshold rule worked in Netanyahu's favor. Only one of the parties on his side, Jewish Home, failed to get more than 3.25% of the total vote; they got 1.2%, or 56,760 votes -- and would have been forced out of the Knesset under the old 2% rule, anyway.   The threshold has been decisive in at least one previous election. Labor leader Yitzhak Rabin became prime minister in 1992 although the left lost the popular vote; a right-wing party failed to cross the threshold, which was 1.5% at the time.  Iran protests  Iranian lawmakers issued a letter on Sunday to the country's leadership calling for severe punishments to be meted out to those found guilty of being involved in the protests, according to state-run Press TV.   The letter was signed by 227 of Iran's 290 members of parliament, and it compared some of the protesters to ISIS militants.     The letter from the MPs also reiterated government claims that the ongoing protests were incited by the United States and other enemies of Iran. Iran has provided no evidence to back up its claims of foreign involvement in the protest movement.   Here's the latest:  Video posted on social media showed Iranian beach soccer player Saeid Piramoon celebrating after scoring a goal against Brazil by doing a symbolic move mimicking hair-cutting, apparently in support of protesters. 
Iranian woman Nasrin Qadri died in Tehran on Saturday after ""suffering severe injuries"" caused by baton blows to the head wielded by Iranian security forces, according to Kurdish human rights group Hengaw and activist outlet IranWire. Nasrin's father said in an on-camera statement that aired on state television that his daughter died of the flu. 
Asked about the situation in Iran, Pope Francis didn't specifically address it specifically but said that a society that does not value women's equality is one that will not progress.    The digest    British PM to raise issue of jailed British-Egyptian writer with Egyptian leadership during COP27 trip  British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has written to the sister of jailed British-Egyptian writer and activist Alaa Abdel-Fattah, who is imprisoned in Cairo, saying he is ""deeply committed"" to resolving her brother's case. In the letter to Abdel-Fattah's sister, shared with CNN by his family, Sunak said he was ""very concerned"" to hear of the writer's ""deteriorating health,"" adding his case ""remains a priority for the British government.""    Background: Abdel-Fattah is a leading activist in the country's 2011 uprising who has been imprisoned over the course of nine years. He was sentenced most recently in December 2021 to five years on charges of spreading false news. 
Why it matters: Abdel-Fattah escalated a more than 200-day hunger strike on Sunday as he stopped drinking water, his sister, activist Sanaa Seif, tweeted. In a letter written to Sunak and shared with CNN, Seif said: ""It is my sincere belief that if Alaa is not released within the coming days that he will die in person, quite possibly while you are in Egypt."" A UK foreign ministry spokesperson told CNN in a statement that the government was working hard to secure Abdel-Fattah's release.         Iran acknowledges drone shipments to Russia 'before war'; Kyiv says Tehran is lying  Iran acknowledged for the first time on Saturday that it had supplied Moscow with drones but said they were sent before the war in Ukraine. Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian said a ""small number"" of drones had been shipped a few months before Russia's February invasion. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Tehran of lying.  Background: In recent weeks Ukraine has reported a surge in drone attacks on civilian infrastructure, notably targeting power stations and dams, using Iranian-made drones. Russia denies its forces have used Iranian drones to attack Ukraine. ""We shoot down at least ten Iranian drones every day, and the Iranian regime claims that it allegedly gave little and even before the start of the full-scale invasion,"" Zelensky said. 
Why it matters: The European Union last month agreed to new sanctions on Iran over drone deliveries, and Britain imposed sanctions on three Iranian military figures and a defense manufacturer. Amirabdollahian repeated Tehran would ""not remain indifferent"" if it were proven Russia had used Iranian drones against Ukraine.      Sweden to distance itself from Kurdish groups in bid to join NATO   Sweden's new government will distance itself from the YPG, a Kurdishmilitia, as it tries to win Turkey's approval to join NATO, Reuters cited Sweden's foreign minister as telling Swedish radio on Saturday.  Background: Turkey considers the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia and its political branch PYD  to be extensions of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which launched an insurgency against Turkey in 1980 and is regarded as a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. Sweden, along with the US and several other NATO countries, has supported the YPG in the fight against ISIS. 
Why it matters: Turkey has vowed to block Sweden's application to join NATO if it doesn't stop supporting the militia group. The Swedish move comes just days before Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson is due to travel to Ankara to try to convince Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan to let Sweden join the military alliance. Sweden and Finland applied to join NATO earlier this year as a direct consequence of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  What to watch  Toomaj Salehi, An Iranian rapper who has used his politically charges lyrics to call for protests, was arrested by the Islamic Republic and charged with crimes punishable by death. The underground artist had been rebelling against the regime for years.   CNN's Jomana Karadsheh tells his story here:     Around the region  Long before world leaders began flocking into Egypt's Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh for the COP27 climate summit on Sunday, Australian activist Mike Smith had been laboring on the country's River Nile banks, picking up used plastic bottles.  His mission resulted in the creation of a large, three-story pyramid of nearly 1 million compressed plastic bottles, put together on display in Egypt's Giza plateau just days ahead of the summit.   ""It's an audacious project we're launching, with an aim of cleaning the planet every year, for the next 100 years,"" Smith told the Australian Associated Press. ""The goal is to be able to pull 15 million water bottles worth of rubbish out of the natural environment, every year, all around the world.""   The activist has been campaigning to reduce the proliferation of single-use plastics for years with attention-grabbing projects.   Last year, he used his start-up, Zero Co, to push Australian households to eliminate single-use plastics from their homes. And in 2020, he reportedly went snorkeling with more than  3,000 plastic bottles strapped to his back to raise awareness of the dire effects of ocean pollution.   As world leaders arrive in Egypt to begin this year's climate summit, Smith told the Australian Associated Press that he will be sleeping in a small tent on top of his plastic-bottle pyramid.

Opinion: What a Netanyahu comeback means for Israel -- and the world,2022-11-03,"If former Saturday Night Live great and actor Bill Murray wasn't hired as a technical adviser to Israel's Central Elections Committee, he surely might have been. Based on pre-election polling it seemed that Israel was headed for yet another Groundhog Day-style hung election for the fifth time in just short of four years.   But this election seems to have produced (final figures won't be available until week's end) what the previous four could not: a majority for Benjamin (Bibi) Netanyahu and his allies and the likely emergence of the most right-wing government in Israel's history.  Indeed, the biggest star in the new political firmament wasn't Netanyahu but the extremist Itamar Ben Gvir, whose bloc Religious Zionism is now the third largest in the Knesset. Here are four things you should know about this election and what may lie ahead.   To Bibi or not to Bibi   Like its four predecessors, this election had one central fault line, if not organizing principle. Are you for or against the return of Netanyahu? Love him or despise him, Netanyahu, at 73, has been the longest governing prime minister in Israel's history.  Even under indictment and on trial for bribery, fraud and breach of trust, Netanyahu is still the most consequential politician on the Israeli scene today and is on the cusp of perhaps his greatest triumph -- returning to the prime ministry with a majority.  For Netanyahu this election was truly existential. Had he failed to secure a governing majority -- one that is likely to pass legislation to postpone or even cancel his trial -- he may well have had to face the consequences of a guilty verdict or a plea bargain that would have driven him away from politics.  But Netanyahu's victory wasn't just an ""all about me"" headline. It reflects and consolidates trend lines that have been in evidence for quite some time. Likud is the most stable and durable political party in Israel's system. Netanyahu is its master and Israel is a nation now shaped more by the right wing -- and perhaps its most extreme elements -- than at any point in its history.  The left and center-left in Israel once dominated by the iconic Labor Party, the driving political force for the first three decades of independence, has been reduced to a shadow of its former self with just a handful of seats in the Knesset. And while the center-left and right bloc of the caretaker Prime Minister Yair Lapid made a respectable showing -- perhaps even garnering more votes -- the fracturing of the left and the Arab vote gave the advantage to the more cohesive and disciplined Netanyahu bloc.  Indeed, without overdramatizing matters, Netanyahu's victory now introduces a cult of personalities -- Netanyahu and Ben Gvir -- that will strengthen the forces of radical nationalism; populism and an us against them mentality dividing and polarizing the country. And if the Netanyahu government succeeds in restricting the powers of the Israel Supreme Court, imposing control over judicial appointments, deepening the grip of Jewish law over public life and reversing the court's decision to strike down legislation aimed at legalizing West Bank settlements, Israeli democracy will be fundamentally undermined, reinforcing the forces of illiberalism, ethnocentrism and disrespect for the rule of law.    There's the right and the extreme right   Israel has been drifting rightward for years. Indeed according to analyst Tamar Hermann of the Israeli Democracy Institute, a full 60% of the Israeli electorate is right-wing; 12-14% identifies as left and the remainder are in the so-called center.  But while polling had predicted that the Religious Zionism -- a bloc of three extremist parties that collectively embody a racist, Jewish supremacist, anti-Arab and homophobic view -- would do well in the election, the extent of their success was nonetheless stunning.  Religious Zionism doubled its numbers from the 2021 election and Gvir, the clear star of the bloc, attracted new voters -- and according to exit polls, raised national turnout by about 6%. It's also going to prove a stunning moment for Netanyahu who midwifed this unholy alliance in an effort to maximize his chances of securing the magic number of 60-plus seats to form a government. It's hardly a coincidence that one of the parties in this bloc led by Bezalel Smotrich has authored a plan to reform (read emasculate) the judicial system and ensure that Netanyahu is immune from prosecution.  The new prime minister is now beholden to these extremists and the two ultra-Orthodox parties who will have a long list of demands. Indeed, Likud polled 31 seats, the right wingers and ultras have as many or more, effectively making him a minority within his own government.  More than that Netanyahu now has a partner-rival in Ben Gvir who, at 46, is just starting his rise in Israeli politics. It should surprise no one if Netanyahu tries to reach out to the more centrist party of Benny Gantz and Gideon Saar to join his coalition to ""save the nation"" in an effort to check Ben Gvir or at a minimum to lessen his extremist demands.    Policy paralysis?   One might be forgiven for thinking that this kind of narrow right-wing government might not last. But there may be more that binds this coalition together than divides it. The two Orthodox parties have been out of power and are eager to secure support for their religious schools and institutions. The Ben Gvir-dominated Religious Zionism bloc sees participation in the government as a way to legitimize his movement, expand his base and his own political horizons. He began his election victory speech by declaring, ""I'm still not prime minister."" And Netanyahu surely will try mightily to keep this coalition together in order to secure his get-out-of-jail-free card through legislation.  How will this government actually behave? It's safe to say as Israel's 75th anniversary approaches next year, it won't bring the country any closer to tackling the domestic and foreign policy challenges it faces and will almost certainly make them worse. At home, Israel will be increasingly polarized, with an independent judiciary and rule of law under serious threat.   Netanyahu has proven himself inherently risk-averse when it comes to acting on matters of war and peace. And he'll try and keep Ben Gvir far away from influencing Israel's national security; and push back on his demands to disband the Palestinian Authority, annex the West Bank and expel Palestinians.  But there will be more settlements and support for settlers; more effort to consolidate control over Jerusalem; relations with Israel's Arab citizens will likely deteriorate with fewer resources for their community and if there's a serious confrontation with Palestinians in the West Bank or in Jerusalem the odds of it morphing into a conflict between Israeli Jews and Arabs will likely grow.   There will be some constraints on the government's behavior. Netanyahu is certainly not interested in a confrontation with Hamas or Hezbollah. He'll want to preserve the recently concluded maritime boundary agreement with Lebanon, maintain the Abraham Accords with the UAE and Bahrain and to lay the groundwork for relations with Saudi Arabia.    Netanyahu and Biden: An inevitable blow up?   Neither President Joe Biden nor Netanyahu will seek out a confrontation. The White House has already put out the following statement. ""We look forward to continuing to work with the Israeli government on our shared interests and values."" Both are far too busy with other matters to want such a problematic distraction.  But even without being tethered to the extremist Ben Gvir, Netanyahu's relations with Biden would have been difficult as their views on settlements, treatment of Palestinians in the West Bank and building in Jerusalem would have clashed.  On Iran, Netanyahu's rhetoric will intensify. And should the Biden Administration have an opportunity to revive the Iran nuclear accord, Netanyahu will resume his earlier campaign in 2015 to make common cause with Republicans to oppose it.  Indeed, Netanyahu, much like Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, would be much more comfortable with the return of Donald Trump or his Republican avatar. In short, with his dance card already full with matters foreign and domestic, the return of Netanyahu, let alone tied to an extremist right wing coalition partner likely to roil the already tense situation with Palestinians -- is something Biden surely didn't want or need.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",55,55.0,0.04808,0.8411200000000002,0.11072000000000003,0.32715294117647054,0.071,0.793,0.135,0.9986,17.99341176470588,104.58473868778279,258.0,0.40536720421621236
Israel Prime Minister Yair Lapid congratulates Benjamin Netanyahu on election victory,2022-11-03,"Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid called Benjamin Netanyahu to congratulate him on winning Israel's elections, the prime minister's office announced Thursday, just under 48 hours after polls closed. Israel's Central Election Committee on Thursday announced the final allocation of seats for the 25th Knesset, giving Netanyahu and his likely political allies 64 seats in the legislature, enough for a governing majority. President Isaac Herzog will begin consultations with politicians on forming a new government after results are officially certified on November 9, he said Wednesday. A Netanyahu return to the head of government could spell fundamental shifts to Israeli society. A Netanyahu government would almost certainly include the newly ascendant Jewish nationalist Religious Zionism/Jewish Power alliance, whose leaders include Itamar Ben Gvir, once convicted for inciting racism and supporting terrorism. When asked by CNN on Tuesday about fears he would lead a far-right government if he returns to office, Netanyahu responded with an apparent reference to the Ra'am party, which made history last year by becoming the first Arab party ever to join an Israeli government coalition. ""We don't want a government with the Muslim Brotherhood, who support terrorism, deny the existence of Israel and are pretty hostile to the United States. That is what we are going to bring,"" Netanyahu told CNN in English at his polling station in Jerusalem. Netanyahu allies have talked about making changes to the judicial system. That could put an end to Netanyahu's own corruption trial, where he has pleaded not guilty. Netanyahu himself has been one of the main issues not only in Tuesday's election but in the four that preceded it, with voters -- and politicians -- splitting into camps based on whether they want the man universally known as Bibi in power or not. Part of the difficulty in building a stable government over the past four elections has been that even some political parties that agree with Netanyahu on the issues refuse to work with him for personal or political reasons of their own. The election was marked by the highest turnout since 2015. The Central Election Committee said 71.3% of eligible voters cast their ballots, which was more than in any of the last four elections that produced stalemates or short-lived governments.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",13,56.0,0.0376,0.8751999999999999,0.08720000000000001,0.2661285714285714,0.055,0.864,0.081,0.7921,3.459671428571428,97.47113319327728,225.0,0.4332050364145657
A far-right surge is set to put Netanyahu back in power. Who are his extremist allies?,2022-11-02,"Israel's longest-serving prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, looks set to storm his way back into power, with partial election results suggesting he and his allies have won a clear majority of seats in the Knesset. Those allies include the far-right Religious Zionism/Jewish Power bloc, which appears to have more than doubled the number of seats it holds -- and which could make the next government the most right-wing in Israel's history. The other two probable Netanyahu coalition partners are ultra-Orthodox party United Torah Judaism and religious Sephardi party Shas, which have long histories of being in government. Both have traditionally sought support for their own communities and worked to keep control of Israel's religious establishment. But this would be the first time that Religious Zionism/Jewish Power could have control of government ministries.  Settler politics The Religious Zionism/Jewish Power leaders draw much of their support from the settler movement -- Jews who live primarily in the West Bank and believe Jews should control the occupied territories. Having them in positions of power, like the Defense or Public Security ministries, could make Israeli-Palestinian relations even worse than they are now. Journalist Anshel Pfeffer, who has written a biography of Netanyahu, suggested before the vote that bringing Religious Zionism/Jewish Power into government could mean expansion of the settlements, which are considered illegal under international law. But that may be their price for joining Netanyahu's coalition, he said. ""Perhaps some settlements in the West Bank which were in the past abandoned by Israel, will be rebuilt, reoccupied?"" Pfeffer said. ""And perhaps further steps towards some type of annexation in the West Bank?"" The party leaders are settlers themselves: Itamar Ben Gvir, who's been convicted of inciting anti-Arab racism and supporting terrorism; and Bezalel Smotrich, who once told Arab members of the Israeli parliament that they were ""here by mistake because [Israel's first prime minister David] Ben Gurion didn't finish the job and throw you out in 1948."" That's when Israel became a state and when many Palestinian families either fled, or were expelled from their homes in the land that became Israel.  Ben Gvir was spotted last month drawing a gun during stone-throwing clashes in the flashpoint east Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah, telling Israeli police to shoot Arabs if they threw stones. He opened a so-called ""office"" -- in fact, a small tent -- on a patch of scrub land in Sheikh Jarrah last year in order to assert Jewish presence in the east Jerusalem neighborhood. That's the flashpoint area where attempted evictions of Palestinian families by Jewish groups who claim ownership of the land have become rallying cries and symbols for the Palestinian cause. Clashes there soon after he put up the tent were among the triggers for 11 days of war between Palestinian militants in Gaza and the Israel Defense Forces last year. A trained lawyer, Ben Gvir has argued settlers' cases right up to Israel's Supreme Court. Pugnacious partner His ally Bezalel Smotrich can be just as pugnacious. Smotrich, who briefly served as transport minister when he was a member of the Jewish Home party, has argued, for example, that people should make no bones about it when they hate someone. ""The most natural instinct, the most normal instinct of a normal man that loves those who love him and hates those who hate him, is to not turn the other cheek,"" he said to defend a bill he co-sponsored to deny entry to Israel to supporters of Israel boycotts. When Smotrich talks of men loving men who love them, he does not mean it in a sexual sense. Smotrich has described himself as a ""proud homophobe"" and as a young man helped organize an anti-Pride Parade event called the Beast Parade, comparing homosexuality to bestiality. He later told the Israeli newspaper Haaretz through a spokesperson that he regretted having done that. But as recently as September, he said LGBTQ people did not deserve any more ""recognition"" than people who violated traffic laws. ""I want to drive through a red light, and I want recognition,"" he joked on an Israeli talk show, Haaretz reported. Smotrich is proposing drastic changes to Israel's legal system and code, including dropping the state's ability to charge a public servant with fraud and breach of trust. Netanyahu faces exactly that charge in an ongoing corruption trial Asked about Smotrich's proposal by CNN's Fareed Zakaria, Netanyahu demurred and said, ""I wouldn't do anything that affects me. I think my trial is unraveling as it is."" The man in charge? Current projections show Netanyahu's Likud party will be the biggest in the likely coalition, probably in command of around 32 seats, and the man Israelis call ""Bibi"" says that means he'll be in the driver's seat. He told Zakaria last month that, even if he did partner with extremist parties, they would not set policy. ""I've had such partners in the past, and they didn't change an iota of my policies. I decide the policy with my party, which is the largest party by far in the country. And we are a center-right party and a responsible party, but we are not going to adopt norms for the government that we don't agree with,"" Netanyahu said. Netanyahu hasn't yet made it back to the prime minister's office, even though the signs look very good for him. Votes are still being tallied, and the result won't be final until each one is counted. At that point, election officials will be able to dole out seats to each party that got more than 3.25% of the national vote. Then President Isaac Herzog will give a mandate to form a government to the politician he thinks is most likely to be able to build a coalition. That process has been torturous in the four elections since April 2019 that preceded this one. But if the latest projections are correct, Netanyahu should have a clear path to a majority government -- and the power to shift Israel significantly to the right. Correction: This story has been updated to clarify that while Religious Zionism/Jewish Power have never controlled government ministries, Smotrich was transport minister in 2019-2020 when he was a member of the Jewish Home party.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",43,57.0,0.02722222222222222,0.8681111111111112,0.10466666666666666,0.3407428571428571,0.084,0.805,0.112,0.9759,14.651942857142856,94.06707605042014,207.0,0.45443031908415527
Netanyahu is back. Here's what that means for Israel,2022-11-02,"Benjamin Netanyahu is set to resurrect his political career and make an astonishing comeback as prime minister of Israel.    Partial election results on Wednesday showed that the Likud party leader's bloc was set to win a comfortable majority of 65 seats in the 120-seat Knesset, or parliament, in an election that saw a seven-year high turnout.   Having been sidelined by much of the country's political mainstream, Netanyahu was given a lifeline by the rise of a far-right party, some of whose leaders are arguably extremists.   Netanyahu is now likely to lead an ever-polarized country and possibly one of the most right-wing governments in Israel's history.    And after five elections in four years, this government might just stick, says Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute.   CNN spoke to Plesner about what a Netanyahu return  could mean for the country.      What do you make of the exit polls and partial election results? Could Netanyahu make a comeback in Israel?    Judging by the actual results and all the exit polls, Netanyahu is undoubtedly Israel's next prime minister. He single-handedly brought out his base on election day at higher percentages than we saw in previous rounds, and while in the end many of them ended up voting for his allies on the right and not for his Likud party, this is what made the difference and was able to break the stalemate of the past four years.   If the numbers we are seeing hold true, Netanyahu will have a governing coalition of between 62 and 65 seats, depending on whether some of the smaller parties pass the minimal threshold, consisting of his Likud party and its ultra-Orthodox and extreme-right allies.        How likely would a Netanyahu-led government be to include far-right parties, and what would the implications of their inclusion be?   It is very unlikely that Netanyahu will renege on his central campaign promise to include all members of his bloc in his government -- including [Jewish Power leader Itamar] Ben Gvir and his partner from the Religious Zionist Party Bezalel Smotrich.   Over his 15 years as prime minister, Netanyahu has proven to be a cautious leader on diplomatic and security matters. While some in the international community have criticized his refusal to make significant concessions to the Palestinians to advance a peace process, he has traditionally also been reluctant to change the status quo in the West Bank in favor of his allies in the settlement movement and often hesitated before committing the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to major military operations.    This cautious approach is not expected to change. The question will be if Ben Gvir -- who has a history of provocative actions against Arab Israelis and Palestinians -- can be trusted to moderate now that he will be in office and not ignite fires that Netanyahu will be forced to put out.    One particular area to focus on is the Temple Mount complex [Al Haram Al Sharif] in Jerusalem which is holy to both Muslims and Jews. Since Israel took control of the area from Jordan in 1967 an uneasy status quo has ensured that Jews are allowed to visit but not pray at this site. Ben Gvir and his allies have been advocating for years to change this policy. A conflict ignited there could quickly spread throughout Israel and even further in the region.        What would Netanyahu's return mean for his trial, and what would it mean for Israel's judicial system?   During the campaign, Netanyahu's allies in the Religious Zionist Party, as well as key members of his Likud party, explicitly ran on the platform of overhauling the judicial system. Motivated by ideology, they proposed to politicize the judiciary by ensuring that judges and legal advisers are appointed by and beholden to political leaders, as well as weaken the checks and balances that exist between the branches of government by instituting an ""override clause"" that would allow the Knesset to overrule Supreme Court decisions. For Netanyahu, such reforms could serve as an escape hatch from his ongoing criminal trials, where he is facing corruption charges, but more importantly, it would also fundamentally alter the existing constitutional order that serves as the foundation for Israeli democracy.       This election registered the highest voter turnout since 2015. What does that say?    Despite its many challenges, Israelis have proven how committed they are to their democracy. While we do not yet have all the data about turnout, it appears that in this election both Arab Israelis and members of the ultra-Orthodox community were particularly motived to vote.    Ahead of the election there were concerns that low turnout in Arab Israeli localities could lead to only one of their three parties crossing the electoral threshold. This seemed to have led to an increase in their turnout. Nevertheless, due to overall high turnout, their representation in the Knesset will probably remain at around 10  seats -- the same as in the outgoing parliament.    For the ultra-Orthodox, the fact that this [the outgoing government] was the first governing coalition they were excluded from since 2015 seems to have motivated their voters to turn out at much higher rates than expected. If the results we are seeing hold true, the ultra-Orthodox parties will play an outsized role in Netanyahu's coalition.        If Netanyahu does form a government, how likely is Israel to return to elections in the near future?   While instability has plagued the Israeli political system for decades, Netanyahu's significant victory and the homogeneous nature of what is likely to be the next government, could ensure that it serves close to a full term.    When the final results are tabulated, if the Netanyahu bloc stands at more than 62 seats, it will take more than one or two disgruntled members of parliament to dismantle it. This means that only in the case of a significant policy disagreement between the coalition partners can we expect this new government to fall. Thus, these elections seem to mark the end of the current crisis that has characterized Israel over the past four years.  This interview has been edited for length and clarity.    Iran protests  Iran indicted about 1,000 people in Tehran province for their alleged involvement in nationwide protests sparked by Mahsa Amini's death in police custody, state-news IRNA said on Monday.  People who ""have serious accusations, including assaulting or martyring security guards, and setting fire to public property... have been scheduled in Revolutionary Court"" Ali Al-Qasi Mehr, chief justice of Tehran province said, according to IRNA.   The trials of those accused will be heard in public this week, IRNA said, citing Mehr.  Here's the latest:  Dissident Iranian rapper Toomaj Salehi, known for anti-regime lyrics, was arrested on Sunday, according to state-run IRNA. He was charged with ""propagandistic activity against the government, cooperation with hostile governments and forming illegal groups with the intention of creating insecurity in the country."" 
The European Union is considering ""further steps"" against Iran, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Monday, after the bloc announced sanctions on Iran's morality police earlier in October. 
Iranian police said Tuesday they will investigate an incident caught on camera showing security forces attacking a man, Fars News Agency said. In the video, security personnel are seen beating a man lying on the ground in front of a residential building. One officer points his gun at him and shoots.    The digest  Iran prepares to send additional weapons including ballistic missiles to Russia, western officials say  Iran is preparing to send approximately 1,000 additional weapons, including surface-to-surface short-range ballistic missiles and more attack drones, to Russia to use in its war against Ukraine, officials from a Western country that closely monitors Iran's weapons program told CNN. While the precise timing of when the shipment will arrive in Russia is unclear, officials believe the weapons will definitely be delivered before the end of the year.  Background: Russia's use of drones in Ukraine increased in the summer, when the United States and Kyiv say Moscow acquired the aircraft  from Iran. In recent weeks Iranian drones have targeted critical energy infrastructure in Ukraine. The last shipment of weapons from Iran to Russia included about 450 drones, officials said. 
Why it matters: The shipment would mark a significant increase in Iranian support to Russia's war effort. It would be the first instance of Iran sending advanced precision-guided missiles to Russia, which could give the Kremlin a substantial boost on the battlefield.    US, Saudi Arabia concerned Iran may be planning an attack on Middle East energy infrastructure   The US and Saudi Arabia have shared intelligence with each other that indicates that Iran may be planning an imminent attack on energy infrastructure in the Middle East, particularly in Saudi Arabia, a US official told CNN. A Saudi official told CNN that Riyadh shared intelligence of a possible attack with the US but the source did not give any specifics. A second US official said US F-22 fighter jets are already in Saudi Arabia and  available to counter any threats.   Background: Iran is facing over a month of unrest that started after the death of Amini, a 22-year-old  woman, in police custody. The Islamic Republic has repeatedly accused Saudi Arabia of supporting the protesters through its media channels, warning it of consequences. 
Why it matters: Saudi Arabia faced a major attack on its oil facilities in 2019 that cut half the country's oil production and jolted the global crude market. The US blamed Iran for that attack. The Iran-allied Houthi group in Yemen has also threatened to strike Saudi Arabia of late.     Climate activist Greta Thunberg not attending 'greenwashing' COP27 summit in Egypt  Teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg said she will not be attending the COP27 climate summit in Egypt, criticizing the event as ""greenwashing."" ""The COPs are mainly being used as an opportunity for leaders and people in power to get attention when they say 'were going to change' and using many different kinds of greenwashing, lying and cheating and so on,"" Thunberg said at an event launching her new book titled 'The Climate Book' at London's Southbank Centre on Sunday.   Background: The COP27 United Nations climate talks will be held in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh from November 6 to 18. Egypt's COP27 presidency has said protests will be allowed in designated areas in Sharm el-Sheikh during the summit, but campaigners have expressed concern that their voices will be curbed.

"Netanyahu on course to lead Israel's most right-wing government ever, partial Israel results suggest",2022-11-02,"Benjamin Netanyahu appears to be on course for a bigger victory in Israel's fifth election in less than four years than initial exit polls suggested, all three of the country's main television channels projected Wednesday morning. His Likud party and its natural allies are currently projected to win 65 seats in the 120-seat Knesset, with 86% of the votes counted as of Wednesday afternoon Israel time.  A coalition of Netanyahu's Likud, the Jewish nationalist Religious Zionism/Jewish Power bloc, Shas and United Torah Judaism would, on paper, be the most right-wing government in Israel's history. Current Prime Minister Yair Lapid and his allies appear to be on track to win 50 seats. An Arab alliance called Hadash-Taal looks is projected to win five seats, and is unlikely to support either Netanyahu or Lapid to lead the country. Voter turnout was 71.3%, the Central Election Committee said. That's the highest since 2015, according to the committee -- higher than any of the four previous elections, 2019 to 2021, which produced stalemates or short-lived governments. Since initial exit polls on Tuesday night, a left-wing party called Meretz appears to have fallen below the 3.25% threshold to win any seats in the Knesset. If the party manages to win enough of the national vote to get seated in parliament, the final results could change. These are not final results; one in five votes nationwide remain to be counted. Final results could come as soon as later Wednesday, but could take until Thursday to arrive. A Netanyahu return to the head of government would spell fundamental shifts to Israeli society. It would include the newly ascendant Jewish nationalist Religious Zionism/Jewish Power alliance, whose leaders include Itamar Ben Gvir, once convicted for inciting racism and supporting terrorism. And Netanyahu allies have talked about making changes to the judicial system. That could put an end to Netanyahu's own corruption trial, where he has pleaded not guilty. Netanyahu himself had been one of the main issues not only in Tuesday's election but in the four that preceded it, with voters -- and politicians -- splitting into camps based on whether they wanted the man universally known as Bibi in power or not. Part of the difficulty in building a stable government over the past four elections has been that even some political parties that agreed with Netanyahu on the issues refused to work with him for personal or political reasons of their own. Getting the official results is going to take some time -- they could be ready as soon as Wednesday, but it might be Thursday before the final makeup of Israel's 25th Knesset is clear. That's partly because parties need to win at least 3.25% of the total vote in order to get any seats in the Knesset at all, a threshold established in an effort to make coalition building easier by keeping very small parties out of the legislature. To determine how many seats each party gets, election officials first need to determine which parties crossed the threshold. Then they can work out how many votes it takes to win a single Knesset seat, and dole out seats to the parties based on the number of votes they got..","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",21,59.0,0.012375,0.912375,0.07525,0.46115,0.033,0.834,0.133,0.9946,9.68415,77.13581605042015,200.0,0.38567908025210074
"In Brazil and Israel, leaders show Trump there can be political next acts",2022-11-02,"It's the season of political comebacks, and don't think ex-President Donald Trump isn't watching. Twice in as many days, in Brazil and Israel, former world leaders who just can't give up that tantalizing taste of political ambition have moved to the cusp of a return to power. Past scandals, their own legal nightmares and treacherous politics aren't stopping them from recreating that dream of a past glory. Trump would love to plow a similar furrow. Both former Brazilian President Luiz Inácio ""Lula"" da Silva and ex-Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have shown that time out of power could be a springboard for unlikely political rebounds. This may be a hopeful sign for Trump, who has leveraged the midterm elections next week as a show of his own power within the Republican Party, anointing a crop of nominees who promote his 2020 election fraud falsehoods. Trump has left no doubt that he's itching to mount another presidential campaign -- not just because he misses the spotlight. He possibly sees a new White House bid as a shield against possible indictment in several criminal probes. ""I will probably have to do it again,"" Trump told supporters at a rally in Texas last month, referring to the possibility of his third presidential campaign, which would be rooted in his still-high popularity in the Republican Party but could founder on his far more uncertain standing among a broader general electorate.  American presidents defeated after only one term have generally faded pretty fast into history. Trump would need to emulate a feat achieved only once before, by President Grover Cleveland, who lost the election of 1888 only to return to the White House after exacting revenge on President Benjamin Harrison after his victory four years later. The art of the political comeback  Israel's Netanyahu, one of Trump's closest friends on the international stage, would love to get the band back together with Trump. On Tuesday, the former prime minister, first elected in 1996 and who has dominated Israeli politics for much of the last quarter century, was on the verge of a stunning second comeback, as initial exit polls suggested he may have won a narrow majority in yet another election in a nation politically split down the middle. And on Sunday in Brazil, Lula da Silva, who's known as ""Lula,"" narrowly defeated President Jair Bolsonaro in a runoff election. While Trump probably would have preferred the opposite result since Bolsonaro is something of a protégé, the leftist former leader's win showed that former presidents can have second acts. Lula da Silva, a former two-term president of Brazil, has, like Trump, had his run-ins with legal authorities. In fact, his long and winding road to a political return detoured through a partial jail term for alleged corruption. The Supreme Court's annulment of his sentences cleared him to run again.  There had been fears that Bolsonaro would emulate his US alter ego and fellow Covid-19 mask rejectionist by refusing to accept the result of an election that tipped him out of power after only a single term. But while he hasn't conceded, the man known as ""The Trump of the Tropics"" says he'll respect the constitution and hasn't so far resorted to inciting an insurrection to try to keep his job. But he's unlikely to go away: He lost the election by the narrowest of margins, his political movement is still strong -- and, like Trump, he may be looking to the future. Bolsonaro and Lula da Silva aren't the only blasts from the past who've tried to pave a way back to power. In Italy, three-time former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is back in parliament after a tax fraud scandal, though his attempt to play kingmaker in coalition talks dissolved after he boasted about his ties with old friend Russian President Vladimir Putin, who just happens to be a hero to Trump as well. Like Lula da Silva and Bolsonaro, Trump enjoys fervent support from loyalist supporters who aren't dissuaded by their run-ins with the law. Lula da Silva emerged from jail as a hero to his followers, one-and-a-half years into a 12-year sentence for corruption and money laundering imposed in 2018. Netanyahu, however, is still embroiled in his corruption trial and faces one charge of bribery and three charges of fraud and breach of trust in three separate investigations. He has adopted a distinctly Trumpian approach to his plight -- slamming the investigations as a ""witch hunt"" and an ""attempted coup"" and, like the former US president, has raised doubts about the legitimacy of the judiciary. As he travels the world, President Joe Biden has been telling allies that ""America is back"" or, in other words, that the disruptive Trump administration that alienated allies and saw the American president cozy up to dictators, is over. Yet many foreign diplomats -- as they observe the vitriol and division in the United States and Trump's strength with his base, not to mention the state-level candidates he's elevated this year who could oversee the 2024 election -- wonder how long they can bank on the more traditional, multilateral brand of stable US leadership Biden is trying to restore. Even if Trump doesn't run in 2024, the power of his movement is so strong in the GOP that a possible future Republican president would likely share his populist, nationalist, ""America First"" instincts. The comeback that failed  Still, the comeback trail is not always kind to populist leaders who have fallen from power. Ex-British Prime Minister Boris Johnson just saw his attempt to win back 10 Downing Street foiled after the short, but disastrous premiership of his successor Liz Truss.  Johnson -- once referred to as ""Britain Trump"" by the former US president -- last month failed to persuade sufficient Conservative MPs to reelect him as their leader and, therefore under the British system, as prime minister.  The chaos, scandals and mismanagement of Johnson's premiership featured partying in Downing Street when the rest of the country was being told to observe strict Covid-19 protocols. Conservative MPs opted instead for former Finance Minister Rishi Sunak, who has only been in power for a week but is already finding out what many observers believe to be the case -- that the Conservative Party is ungovernable. Johnson, like Trump, isn't ready to cede the limelight. On Tuesday, he told Sky News that he planned to attend the COP27 climate summit in Egypt later this month. He made the announcement after Sunak said he wouldn't attend owing to the demands of salvaging the British economy. But on Wednesday, the sitting prime minister tweeted that he would indeed go to the conference -- amid suggestions he didn't want to be overshadowed by one of his predecessors. Johnson, unlike Trump, did not get defeated in a general election. Instead, his colleagues decided he was an electoral liability, which is very different from how the GOP has treated Trump. Johnson still believes he has a mandate to rule, given the landslide election win he masterminded in December 2019 -- and it's a safe bet he'd be ready to pounce if Sunak founders. Johnson's hero is Winston Churchill, the original political comeback kid who endured years in the political wilderness before his country turned to him for leadership in its darkest hour in World War II. After his shock defeat in the 1945 election, the great Briton didn't go away either: He returned to 10 Downing Street as prime minister six years later.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",43,60.0,0.039,0.8410000000000001,0.12,0.5287,0.09,0.78,0.131,0.9955,22.734099999999998,81.87650428571428,188.0,0.43551332066869297
Netanyahu on brink of comeback as Israeli exit polls point to narrow majority for ex-PM,2022-11-01,"Former Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu was on the verge of making a triumphant return to office in Israel, as initial exit polls suggested he may have scraped a narrow majority in the country's fifth national election in less than four years. If exit polls are correct -- a big if -- Netanyahu and his political allies appear to be on pace to win most seats in the Knesset, Israel's parliament. As expected, first exit polls from the country's three main broadcasters suggested late on Tuesday that no party won enough seats to govern on its own, meaning that it will be necessary to build a coalition government.  The exit polls projected pro-Netanyahu parties would take 61 or 62 of the parliament's 120 seats. The alliance is comprised of Netanyahu's Likud party, Religious Zionism/Jewish Power, Shas and United Torah Judaism.  The alliance backing the current acting Prime Minister Yair Lapid, comprised of Yesh Atid, National Unity, Yisrael Beiteinu, Labor, Meretz and Ra'am, was poised to take 54 or 55 seats, according to the exit polls.  The Arab party Hadash/Taal, which is unlikely to support either side, was set to secure four seats, the exit polls suggested. The election was marked by the highest turnout since 2015. The Central Election Committee said 71.3% of eligible voters cast their ballots, which was more than in any of the last four elections that produced stalemates or short-lived governments. Netanyahu spent the closing weeks of the campaign barnstorming the country in a truck converted into a travelling stage encased in bulletproof glass. Pro-Netanyahu ads -- and ads depicting his opponents looking shady -- plastered the sides of buses.  It's not yet certain that Netanyahu has made a comeback, after he was outmaneuvered following last year's elections by Lapid.  The exit polls are only projections based on interviews with voters on Tuesday, not official results. The results can -- and have in the past -- change throughout the election night. Official results may not be final until Wednesday or even Thursday. Once official results are in, President Isaac Herzog will invite the politician he deems most likely to be able to form a government to open coalition negotiations.  A Netanyahu return to the head of government could spell fundamental shifts to Israeli society. A Netanyahu government would almost certainly include the newly ascendant Jewish nationalist Religious Zionism/Jewish Power alliance, whose leaders include Itamar Ben Gvir, once convicted for inciting racism and supporting terrorism. If the exit polls turn out to be correct, the far-right alliance would more than double its representation in the Knesset. The grouping had six seats in the outgoing parliament; exit polls project that they have won 14 or 15 seats this time around.  When asked by CNN on Tuesday about fears he would lead a far-right government if he returns to office, Netanyahu responded with an apparent reference to the Ra'am party, which made history last year by becoming the first Arab party ever to join an Israeli government coalition. ""We don't want a government with the Muslim Brotherhood, who support terrorism, deny the existence of Israel and are pretty hostile to the United States. That is what we are going to bring,"" Netanyahu told CNN in English at his polling station in Jerusalem. And Netanyahu allies have talked about making changes to the judicial system. That could put an end to Netanyahu's own corruption trial, where he has pleaded not guilty.  Netanyahu himself has been one of the main issues not only in Tuesday's election but in the four that preceded it, with voters -- and politicians -- splitting into camps based on whether they want the man universally known as Bibi in power or not.  Part of the difficulty in building a stable government over the past four elections has been that even some political parties that agree with Netanyahu on the issues refuse to work with him for personal or political reasons of their own. Coalition building Regardless of whether the exit polls are correct or not, they are only exit polls, not official results.  Getting the official results is going to take some time -- they could be ready as soon as Wednesday, but it might be Thursday before the final makeup of Israel's 25th Knesset is clear.   That's partly because parties need to win at least 3.25% of the total vote in order to get any seats in the Knesset at all, a threshold established in an effort to make coalition building easier by keeping very small parties out of the legislature. To determine how many seats each party gets, election officials first need to determine which parties crossed the threshold. Then they can work out how many votes it takes to win a single Knesset seat, and dole out seats to the parties based on the number of votes they got.  That's the point where the real wheeling and dealing begins.  There's a slim chance that even if the election results look like a deadlock, a clever negotiator can pull a surprise coalition together, the way Lapid did last year. On the other hand, even if on paper, it looks like one leader or another has the backing to form a majority government, they'll still need to cajole the smaller parties into coalition agreements.  And those smaller parties will have demands -- control of particular ministries, funding for projects or programs important to their constituents, bringing in new laws or getting rid of old ones.  Potential prime ministers will need to balance out the competing demands of rival coalition partners, each one of whom knows that they hold the keys to putting a head of government into office.  And whoever becomes prime minister -- if anyone does -- will face the same problems.  The cost of living is skyrocketing in Israel as in so many other places, with energy and grocery bills spiking. An Israel Democracy Institute poll this summer found that a party's economic platform was far and away the factor most often named as a reason for choosing who to vote for. Nearly half (44%) of Israeli voters said it was the most important factor, well ahead of the quarter (24%) who said party leader was the determiner.  Any new prime minister will also need to confront the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian militias that has claimed more lives on both sides this year than any time since 2015.  The Israel Defense Forces have been carrying out frequent raids for months into the occupied West Bank -- particularly Jenin and Nablus -- saying they are trying to apprehend known attackers and seize weapons. As a strategy, it does not seem to have reduced the level of violence: at least one Israeli civilian was shot and killed near Hebron in the West Bank on Saturday, and others were wounded in the same incident -- as were two medics who responded, one Israeli and one Palestinian. A day later, a Palestinian man rammed his car into five Israeli soldiers near Jericho. Both Palestinian attackers were killed, in a cycle of violence that the new prime minister will need to deal with -- if, indeed, there is a new prime minister as a result of Tuesday's vote.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",44,61.0,0.030999999999999996,0.8815333333333333,0.08746666666666665,0.28621,0.057,0.836,0.108,0.9938,12.593240000000002,91.01007285714284,219.0,0.41557110893672533
Netanyahu eyes comeback as Israel votes in fifth election in four years,2022-11-01,"Israelis are heading to the ballot box for an unprecedented fifth time in four years on Tuesday, as Israel holds yet another national election aimed at ending the country's ongoing political deadlock.    For the first time in 13 years, former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not running as the incumbent. Bibi, as he is universally known in Israel, is hoping to return to power as the head of a hard-right coalition, while centrist caretaker Prime Minister Yair Lapid is hoping the mantle of the acting premiership will help keep him in place.   Netanyahu issued a stark warning as he cast his ballot on Tuesday morning.  When asked by CNN about fears he would lead a far-right government if returns to office, Netanyahu responded with an apparent reference to the Ra'am party, which made history last year by becoming the first Arab party ever to join an Israeli government coalition.  ""We don't want a government with the Muslim Brotherhood, who support terrorism, deny the existence of Israel and are pretty hostile to the United States. That is what we are going to bring,"" Netanyahu told CNN in English, at his polling station in Jerusalem.     Lapid, who hopes he and his political allies will defy polling predictions and remain in power, cast his ballot in Tel Aviv on Tuesday with a message to voters: ""Good morning, vote wisely. Vote for the State of Israel, the future of our children and our future in general."" The name of Lapid's party, Yesh Atid, means ""there is a future."" The country was on track to have its highest voter turnout in an election since 1999. Turnout was 47.5% by mid-afternoon, the Central Election Committee said, more than five points higher than it was at the same time in the last vote. There had been a strong get-out-the-vote effort ahead of Tuesday, with Netanyahu barnstorming the country in a converted truck turned into a bulletproof travelling stage, and Arab parties urging Arab citizens to vote to keep Netanyahu out.  But if the final opinion polls are on target, it seems unlikely that this round of voting will be any more successful in clearing the logjam than the last four.  Those polls project that Netanyahu's bloc will fall one seat short of a majority in parliament.   Just like in the previous four elections, Netanyahu himself -- and the possibility of a government led by him  -- is one of the defining issues, especially as his corruption trial continues. A poll by the Israel Democracy Institute (IDI) in August found a quarter of respondents said the identity of the party leader they were voting for was the second most important factor in their vote.     But some top politicians on the center-right, who agree with him ideologically, refuse to work with him for personal or political reasons. So, in order to make a comeback, Netanyahu, leader of the center-right Likud party, is likely going to depend on the support of extreme right-wing parties to form a coalition -- and if successful, may be forced to give their leaders ministerial positions.    Israelis are also very concerned about cost of living, after seeing their utility and grocery bills shoot up this year. In the same IDI poll, 44% said their first priority was what a party's economic plan would do to mitigate the cost of living.  And security, always a major issue in Israeli politics, is on voters' minds -- 2022 has been the worst year in for conflict-related deaths for both Israelis and Palestinians since 2015.     Bibi on a knife edge   A recent compilation of polls put together by Haaretz shows that Netanyahu's bloc of parties is likely to either come up just shy of -- or just reach -- the 61 seats needed to form a majority in the government, while the bloc led by Lapid falls short by around four to five seats.       According to pollsters Joshua Hantman and Simon Davies, the last week of polling saw a small bump for Netanyahu's bloc, showing it passing the 61-seat mark in six polls, and falling short in nine. The final three polls published on Friday by the three major Israeli news channels, all showed his bloc at 60 seats in the 120-seat Knesset.   Recognizing the need to eke out just one or two more seats, Netanyahu has been focusing his campaigning in places that are strongholds for Likud. Party officials have previously claimed that hundreds of thousands of likely Netanyahu voters didn't vote.  Another major factor is the Arab turnout. Citizens who identify as Arab and have national voting rights make up around 17% of the Israeli population, according to IDI; their turnout could make or break Netanyahu's chances. One of the parties, the United Arab List, has warned if Arab turnout falls below 48%, some of the Arab parties could fail to pass the 3.25% vote threshold needed to gain any seats in parliament.    The voting environment   Along with soaring grocery and utility bills and a nearly impossible housing market, Tuesday's vote takes place against the backdrop of an increasingly tense security environment.    Earlier this year, a wave of attacks targeting Israelis killed 19 people, including mass attacks targeting civilians in Tel Aviv and other cities in Israel. There has also been a surge in armed assaults on Israeli troops and civilian settlers by Palestinian militants in the occupied West Bank this year, claiming the lives of several more soldiers and Israeli civilians. According to the Israel Defense Forces, there have been at least 180 shooting incidents in Israel and the occupied territories this year, compared to 61 shooting attacks in 2021.    In the days leading up to election day, an Israeli man was killed and several injured in a shooting attack in the West Bank near Hebron. The next day, several soldiers were injured in a car ramming attack near the West Bank city of Jericho. The Palestinian attackers were killed in both cases.  Israeli settler attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank -- and sometimes on Israeli soldiers -- are also on the rise, according to the human rights group B'Tselem.    Near-daily Israeli security raids in West Bank cities have killed more than 130 Palestinians this year. While the Israeli military says most were militants or Palestinians violently engaging with them -- including the newly formed 'Lion's Den' militia -- unarmed and uninvolved civilians have been caught up as well.      The death of Al Jazeera correspondent Shireen Abu Akleh in May while covering an Israeli military raid in the West Bank caught worldwide attention. After several months the Israeli military admitted it was most likely their own soldiers who shot Abu Akleh -- saying it was an unintentional killing in the midst of a combat zone.    Palestinian disillusionment with their own leadership's ability to confront the Israeli occupation has led to a proliferation of these new militias -- and a fear among experts that a third Palestinian intifada, or uprising, is on the way.   How does voting and forming a government work?   There are 40 political parties on the ballot, although only around a dozen parties are expected to pass the threshold to sit in the parliament. Immediately after polls close at 10 p.m. local time (4 p.m. ET), the major media networks release exit polls that give the first glimpse of how the vote went -- although the official vote tally can vary from exit polls, often by small but crucial amounts.    Only a dozen or so parties are expected to pass the minimum threshold of votes needed to sit in parliament.    Once the vote is officially tallied, Israeli President Isaac Herzog will hand the mandate to form a government to the leader he considers most likely to succeed -- even if they're not the leader of the largest party.    That candidate then has a total of 42 days to try and corral enough parties to reach the magic number of 61 seats of the 120-seat Knesset, the Israeli parliament, to form a majority government. If they fail, the President can transfer the mandate to another candidate. If that person fails within 28 days, then the mandate goes back to the parliament which has 21 days to find a candidate, a last chance before new elections are triggered. Lapid would stay on as caretaker prime minister until a new government is formed.

Netanyahu eyes extremist political support in comeback attempt,2022-10-28,"When Benjamin Netanyahu hits the campaign trail, he uses what's been dubbed the Bibimobile -- a converted truck turned into a travelling stage ensconced in bulletproof glass.          Elevated like a king above his subjects --- who fawn over him as the one and only savior to lead Israel.     And with polls showing Netanyahu's block of parties falling short of the needed 61-seat majority to form a government, the former prime minister has been taking the Bibi show around Israel to try and shore up every last one of his supporters ahead of the November 1 elections.    At a campaign stop last week in Kiryat Malachi, Netanyahu tells supporters from the Bibimobile: ""Don't be despondent, be turbocharged. Bring everybody at home and tell them this time don't stay at home -- go and vote.""    For the first time in more than 12 years, Netanyahu has been campaigning from the outside -- as opposition leader. After four elections in three years failed to bring about a stable government, Netanyahu was toppled from his perch as the longest-serving prime minister by Naftali Bennett and current caretaker Prime Minister Yair Lapid, who formed an unlikely coalition of diverse parties.     Their coalition -- made up of parties from the right wing to the left, and, for the first time, an Arab party -- had consensus on few issues but all agreed Netanyahu needed to be out. But ultimately it was their diversity -- and a few rebellious members -- that brought about the coalition's downfall and now, Israel's fifth election in less than four years.     Netanyahu's potential path back to power is a narrow one. The same political leaders who refused to work with him after the 2021 election -- even if they fell into the same center-right ideological camp as Netanyahu -- don't seem any more likely to support him this year. That means Netanyahu will have to rely on parties further to the right in order to build a coalition, and the resulting government could reshape Israeli laws and society in a way no Israeli government has done before.   Polls suggest no bloc has a clear majority that could form a ruling government -- but Netanyahu's Likud party looks like it will be the biggest single party in the Knesset. Campaign advertisements on buses show Netanyahu pointing at the viewer, saying the path to the majority ""is up to you!""      Netanyahu has been campaigning on the policies he championed when he was in power: safety and security, preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, supporting Jewish settlements in the West Bank, maintaining Israel's military deterrence against enemies, and, in these tough economic times, reducing the cost of living.   But he himself may be the single biggest election issue.   His supporters -- acting more like fans at a sporting event -- eat it up.     One of them, jumping in front of the CNN camera, yells ""Bibi is King of Israel! All people in the world is afraid of Bibi because the man is strong.""     And, it's whether or not voters are afraid of what Netanyahu will do that will determine how they vote.   ""We're not talking about the future of the Israeli Palestinian conflict. We're not really talking about cost of living, though Israel, like every other country is facing its own cost of living crisis,"" said Anshel Pfeffer, The Economist and Haaretz correspondent who wrote a 2018 biography of Netanyahu called ""Bibi: The Turbulent Life and Times of Benjamin Netanyahu.""   ""We're not talking about any other policy issue really, beyond Netanyahu and what Netanyahu will do on the day after the election,"" he said. A chance to quash the trials     He's also talking about reforming the judiciary.   Despite the ongoing campaign, Netanyahu is still in the midst of his corruption trial -- where he faces one charge of bribery and three charges of fraud and breach of trust in three separate corruption investigations.    Netanyahu has pleaded not guilty and called his ongoing corruption trial a ""witch hunt"" and an ""attempted coup"" and has called for changes to Israel's judiciary system.    Yohanan Plesner, a former member of the Israeli parliament and the president of the Israel Democracy Institute, said that if Netanyahu comes back to power, his first focus will be on using his majority to put a stop to the trial.    ""His energy and focus will be on his trial, on eroding and undermining the independence, the independence of the judiciary, perhaps firing the Attorney General, those kinds of maneuvers that will allow him to free himself from the legal process that he's facing,"" Plesner said.     Plesner said the Israeli public's debate about the future of Netanyahu is ""entangled with a major debate about the features of Israeli democracy, how Israeli democracy should look like and the independence of the judiciary ... the very nature and fundamental characteristics of our democracy.""    One of Netanyahu's likely coalition allies, right-wing religious Zionist leader Bezalel Smotrich, has proposed a series of drastic legal reforms, seen by many critics as a clear way to undercut judicial independence, including dropping the ability to charge a public servant with fraud and breach of trust -- a charge Netanyahu faces in his current trial.      Asked about the proposal by CNN's Fareed Zakaria, Netanyahu demurred and said, ""I wouldn't do anything that affects me. I think my trial is unraveling as it is.""    Extremists with power      Much of Netanyahu's support in a future government would need to come from the extreme right wing.    The coalition would include a new joint group led by Smotrich and Itamar Ben Gvir, an extremist who has been convicted for supporting terrorism and inciting racism.     He was known for hanging in his home a portrait of the Israeli man who massacred 29 Palestinians in 1994 before being beaten to death himself.     In 2020, Ben Gvir tweeted he would take the portrait down, ahead of the elections, ""...for the sake of unity and the victory of the right,"" he said.     Earlier this month, Ben Gvir inflamed already sky-high tensions in the flashpoint Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah by pulling a gun during clashes between Israelis and Palestinians, yelling at police to shoot Arabs who were throwing stones.     But polls show Smotrich and Ben Gvir's joint party on the rise and could garner more than a dozen seats in the 120-seat Knesset -- a showing many Israelis thought unfathomable just a few years ago --  becoming a key pillar of Netanyahu's comeback attempt, and power.    Plesner said Netanyahu would once have ""never dreamt of including such an extreme figure in his government,"" but now he may need to appoint the once outcast Ben Gvir to a ministerial position.    ""Now he has no choice. The more moderate Israeli politicians do not want anything to do with Mr. Netanyahu. And therefore he built partnerships [with] these really extreme right. We might expect to see Ben Gvir in the government. What kind of portfolio? What power will you have beyond a provocations and populism?"" Plesner said.     Pfeffer told CNN that these extremists will extract a price from Netanyahu -- that may include showing more favors towards West Bank settlers.    ""The question is, what is the price that the far right is going to extricate from him? .... perhaps some settlements in the West Bank which were in the past abandoned by Israel, will be rebuilt, reoccupied?"" Pfeffer said. ""And perhaps further steps towards some type of annexation in the West Bank?""     All are moves that would likely inflame and escalate tensions with the Palestinians.     Just last year Netanyahu said Ben Gvir wasn't fit to serve in the cabinet. But earlier this month, Netanyahu reversed himself, when asked if Ben Gvir would be a minister in his government.     ""He certainly can, anyone can,"" he said.     But Moshe Klughaft, an international political strategist who used to work with Netanyahu, said he doesn't think the former PM will take extreme steps because a government with the likes of Ben Gvir will collapse quickly.     ""He will not do significant movements like applying (sovereignty over) the territories or something like this. Netanyahu's strategy is work for the short term, and then for another short term and another short term and not for the long term,"" Klughaft told CNN. ""So now he wants to win the elections, to gain 61 (seats). After this, he will want to establish a government and after this, I think he will want to go to another election as a caretaker prime minister.""    In his interview with CNN's Zakaria, Netanyahu denied that the extremists will have any power.       ""I've had such partners in the past, and they didn't change an iota of my policies. I decide the policy with my party, which is the largest party by far in the country. And we are a center-right party and a responsible party, but we are not going to adopt norms for the government that we don't agree with,"" Netanyahu said.    But before he can decline such policy ideas, he'll need to claw his way back to power, one parliamentary seat at a time.     Iran protests  Government supporters demonstrated outside the British embassy in Tehran to protest the UK government's ""role"" in recent unrest in Iran, state-aligned news agency Tasnim said on Thursday.  Tasnim said the student protesters accuse the UK of supporting BBC Persian and Iran International, networks that they say encourage anti-government demonstrations across the country.    ""In recent weeks, several channels including Iran International, Manoto, BBC and Radiofarda have been officially teaching guerilla warfare and battle tactics"" and ""have formed a kind of media terrorism,"" Tasnim said.  Here's the latest on this developing story:  Germany's foreign ministry invited the Iranian ambassador to a meeting in Berlin on Thursday after the German ambassador was summoned in Tehran in response to ""interventionist positions."" 
Amnesty International said on Thursday that Iran's security forces killed at least eight people in less than 24 hours after opening fire ""on mourners and protesters in at least four provinces."" CNN cannot independently verify the death toll. 
Mourners gathering near the village of Veysian to commemorate the 40th day since the death of Nika Shahkarami, a 16-year-old protester who went missing on September 20, were met with gunfire and tear gas by security forces, according to video posted on social media and geolocated by CNN.

Gulf states use new oil riches to gain regional influence,2022-10-31,"Big Gulf Arab oil states are using the newfound riches they've reaped as a result of the Ukraine war to build economic bridges with their poorer neighbors, some of whom they once considered adversaries.    The monarchies are now doubling down on economic cooperation. At the heart of this diplomatic initiative are sovereign wealth funds, which are working to secure regional stability through billions of dollars' worth of investments.    Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates -- both of which are generating massive returns from this year's oil price hikes -- are taking the lead with such investments, entrenching themselves in countries that have faced unrest in part because of economic distress.   Middle Eastern energy exporters, including Gulf countries, are expected to see a windfall of around $1 trillion dollars over the next four years on the back of this year's oil boom, said the International Monetary Fund (IMF) last week.     ""Money talks,"" Michael Maduell, president of the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute in Las Vegas, told CNN. ""Sovereign wealth funds can be used as foreign policy tools, a sort of soft power.""  After almost a decade of a combative regional policy, Saudi Arabia and the UAE are moving towards a less confrontational approach. Both have mended ties with regional foes Turkey and Qatar, and both have reached out to Iran. They have also significantly reduced their military activity in Yemen, where they went to war seven years ago.   Analysts say this is a new approach to ensure regional stability, mainly by bolstering key economies across the Middle East through investments that are closely tied to their funders.   ""The current structure is certainly an evolution from days where hard power was viewed as more productive,"" said Ayham Kamel, head of Eurasia Group's Middle East and North Africa research team.    Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, last week announced that the nation's wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund (PIF), is establishing five regional companies worth $24 billion across the Middle East.    From infrastructure and real estate development to telecoms and technology, PIF's new investments target Bahrain, Iraq, Oman, Jordan, Sudan and Egypt.   Some of these countries experienced political upheaval when the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings rocked the region more than a decade ago. Others are still wedged in the economic and political chaos left behind.   ""This is part of the soft and sticky power aspect of the strategic and tactical move away from a decade of confrontation and conflict initiated by the Arab Spring,"" said Hussein Ibish, a senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington.   ""The countries that projected power in the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia and the UAE -- with the partial exception of Iran -- found themselves overextended and to some extent exhausted after a decade of confrontation,"" he told CNN.   PIF's announcement came on the second day of the Future Investment Initiative in Riyadh. In a statement, PIF said that it was pursuing a ""strategy of seeking new investment opportunities in the MENA region."" The investments are also meant to ""diversify Saudi Arabia's sources of revenue,"" it added.    Last year was generally good for state-owned investors around the world, according to Global SWF's 2022 annual report, with the size of the sovereign wealth fund industry expanding by 6% in 2021 and for the first time in history exceeding the $10 trillion mark.   The UAE's wealth funds in particular are at the forefront of the industry. The Gulf state manages around $1.3 trillion through its four funds, said Global SWF.    One of the key regional investment destinations for both Abu Dhabi and Riyadh has been Egypt. A North African state with pinching economic troubles, Egypt erupted in nationwide protests in 2011, leading to the fall of longtime ruler Hosni Mubarak. To Gulf states' dismay, the events that followed briefly gave rise to the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist political group that is viewed with suspicion in Saudi Arabia and the UAE and is now considered a terrorist organization by both.   Egypt's unrest more than a decade ago was sparked partly by the nation's economic woes. Today, the Egyptian currency is again falling in value and inflation is soaring as authorities try to keep the economy afloat by securing loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).    In August, Abu Dhabi Developmental Holding Company (ADQ), one of the emirate's wealth funds, announced a number of investments in publicly listed companies in Egypt, ""building on its long-term commitment to investing in the country's economic growth through its $20 billion joint strategic investment platform,"" it said in a statement.    Saudi Arabia's PIF also launched the Saudi Egyptian Investment Company (SEIC) in August, a company dedicated to investments in several vital sectors of the Egyptian economy. SEIC has bought $1.3 billion dollars' worth of stakes in four Egyptian companies.    Gulf monarchies' financial diplomatic hand has already proven effective in some countries. Once a regional rival, Turkey is now an economic ally of Saudi Arabia and the UAE.    ""Even with adversaries, the Gulf states now see their financial assets as potentially important levers in building bridges and incentivizing more moderate policies in these countries,"" said Kamel. ""Rapprochement with Turkey has come with valuable investments or financial injections.""   Facing a grueling currency crisis at home, mending ties with Saudi Arabia and the UAE comes at an opportune time for Ankara.    Last year, the UAE established a $10 billion dollar investment fund to ""support the Turkish economy and boost the bilateral cooperation between the two countries.""    A number of other agreements between the UAE's ADQ and the Turkey Wealth Fund (TWF) also followed, with major investments planned in venture capital and companies with high-growth potential in Turkey.   And this month, Saudi Minister of Commerce Majid Bin Abdullah Al-Qasabi said that his country's investments in Turkey now amount to $18 billion, according to the Saudi Gazette, adding that PIF is looking at further investment opportunities there.    Despite a political thaw, Gulf investments in Iran and Syria are unlikely for the time being, say analysts. But there are signs of a growing economic relationship with them. Iran and the UAE are targeting $30 billion in annual trade within the next two years from $20 billion this year, the Tehran Times reported. Earlier this year, Syrian TV reported that the UAE is weighing investments in the country, without providing details.    But those kinds of economic partnerships may go a long way in helping shield Gulf nations from future unrest and conflict with their neighbors.   ""Infrastructure integration,"" says Ibish, can help ""reduce the risk of conflict by creating mutual interests and interdependency,"" giving countries strong incentives to avoid confrontation.  Iran protests  The head of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards Hossein Salami called on Iranians to stop protesting, warning that Saturday would be their ""last day"" of protest.  Speaking from the funeral of victims of the attack carried out by ISIS in the city of Shiraz on Wednesday, Salami, called on Iranian youth specifically to desist protesting.   ""Today is the last day of the riots. Do not come to the streets again. What do you want from this nation?,"" Salami said.    Despite Salami's warning, the protests have continued. Iran has been gripped by weeks of of public demonstrations since the death of 22-year-old Iranian woman Mahsa Amini in morality police custody.    Here's the latest:  Violent clashes broke out between security forces and student protestors at university campuses across Iran on Sunday, according to Iranian activist and human rights groups. 
More than 300 Iranian journalists released a statement on Sunday calling for the release of colleagues Niloofar Hamedi and Elaheh Mohammadi, who were arrested and sent to Tehran's Evin prison for covering the death of Mahsa Amini, according to independent Iranian newspaper Etemad.

The digest    President Aoun leaves office as Lebanon's crisis worsens  Michel Aoun, the 89-year-old Christian president who presided over Lebanon's financial meltdown and the deadly Beirut port blast, vacated the presidential palace on Sunday, leaving a void at the top of the Lebanese state, Reuters reported.  Background: Lebanon's parliament has so far been unable to agree on a successor in the role, which has the power to sign bills into law, appoint new prime ministers and green-light government formations before they are voted on by parliament. Parliament has convened four times to try to elect a successor but no candidate has won a majority. 
Why it matters: That leaves Lebanon in the unprecedented situation of having a presidential vacuum and a caretaker cabinet with limited powers, as the premier-designate has been unable to form a government for six months. In an interview with Reuters a day before his departure, Aoun said Lebanon was sliding into ""constitutional chaos,"" given the lack of clarity over what prerogatives the caretaker cabinet and the parliament would each have.    Netanyahu projected to fall just short of majority in Israel elections  Former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his allies are projected to fall one seat short of a majority in elections, the final opinion polls published before Tuesday's voting suggest. Three different polls for the three main television broadcasters all projected that the pro-Netanyahu bloc would win 60 seats in the 120-seat Knesset. Netanyahu's main opponent, Acting Prime Minister Yair Lapid, is also projected to fall short of a majority, winning 56 seats.   Background: The polls were released by Channel 11, 12 and 13 late on Friday -- the last day, by law, when opinion polling for the November 1 election can be published. The remaining four seats are projected to go to an Arab grouping called Hadash/Taal, which is not likely to support either a Netanyahu- or Lapid-led government, or be invited to do so.  
Why it matters: Israel is set to have its fifth election in four years. But if the final pre-election polls are anything to go by, Tuesday's vote could fail to break the political logjam that has paralyzed the country.

Five elections in four years: What's the deal with Israeli politics?,2022-10-30,"Stop us if you're heard this one before: On Tuesday, Israelis are going to the polls to elect a new Knesset, or parliament. It's the fifth time in less than four years that voters are casting ballots. Holding elections that often is bound to prompt some questions. Here are some answers. Why does Israel have elections so often? Israel has a parliamentary system made up of several parties -- none of which have ever received enough votes on their own to secure a majority of seats in parliament. That means parties must team up to form coalitions and reach the 61 seats needed to form a ruling government. Those coalitions can also be shaky -- lose one party's support, or sometimes even one member of parliament, and you've lost the majority. The other factor is Benjamin Netanyahu. He served as prime minister for longer than anyone else in Israeli history, is in the midst of a corruption trial, and overall is a polarizing figure. Some top politicians on the center-right, who agree with him ideologically, refuse to work with him for personal or political reasons. That made it difficult for him to build lasting governing majorities following the previous four elections, and last year, his opponents managed to cobble together a never-before-seen coalition of parties from across the political spectrum to keep him out of power. But that coalition only held together for about a year and a quarter before its leaders, Yair Lapid and Naftali Bennett, pulled the plug and called for new elections. Who are the main contenders this time around? Netanyahu's center-right Likud party will almost certainly be the largest party in the Knesset after Tuesday's vote, if the polls are correct. They'll probably win about 30 seats, a quarter of the total, a compilation of polls by Haaretz, for example, suggests.   Current Prime Minister Yair Lapid will be hoping his centrist Yesh Atid party will come in a strong second place.   The man he partnered with to assemble the last government, Naftali Bennett, is not running this time around; his party has splintered and faces a potential electoral wipeout. Defense Minister Benny Gantz is aiming for a strong showing at the head of a new party called National Unity, a successor to his Blue and White party which now includes former Bennett ally Gideon Saar and former Israel Defense Forces chief of staff Gadi Eisenkot, making his political debut. A far-right coalition called the Religious Zionist Party, headed by Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben Gvir, could be the largest extreme right-wing group ever seated in the Knesset.  On the other hand, the once-mighty Labor Party and its predecessors, which governed Israel essentially as a one-party state for its first 30 years under David Ben-Gurion and his successors, is a shadow of its former self, and is projected to win only a handful of seats. How does the election work? Israel is a parliamentary democracy, where people vote for the party they support. Each party that gets at least 3.25% of the popular vote gets a certain number of seats in the Knesset based on the percentage of the total number of votes it won. The 3.25% threshold is intended to keep very small parties out of the Knesset, an attempt to make it easier to build governing coalitions. Israel has experimented in the past with electing the prime minister directly, separate from the Knesset, the way the US elects the president and Congress separately. It proved unwieldy and the country went back to standard parliamentary elections. What's expected to happen? The final polls suggest that Netanyahu's party and its potential allies are hovering right around the knife edge number of 60 seats and the drama of election night will be whether the former PM scrapes above it.  If his bloc clearly wins a majority, his path to building a government is clear and he will return to power. If the pro-Netanyahu bloc falls below 61 seats, things are more complicated. Netanyahu would still probably have the first chance to form a government if his Likud party is the biggest in the Knesset, which could result in days or weeks of negotiations that go nowhere. If he fails, President Isaac Herzog can then decide to give the mandate to current Acting Prime Minister Lapid, or to another lawmaker whom Herzog calculates may have the best chance to form a government.  That could mean no one can build a majority government, raising the possibility of ... more elections. While party negotiations are taking place and until a new government is formed, Lapid remains in place as caretaker prime minister. What are the key issues for Israeli voters? Israelis are concerned about many of the same issues that people around the world are -- the cost of living in particular. They are also always focused on security. In the region, Iran's nuclear ambitions and support of militant groups are always a worry, and more locally, violence is high this year between Israelis and Palestinians. Some constituencies have their own specific concerns, such as the ultra-Orthodox, who want state support for their institutions and exemptions from army service; and religious Zionists, who want backing for West Bank settlements. But overwhelmingly, Israeli elections these days are about one issue and one man: Benjamin Netanyahu. Correction: This article has been updated to remove an incorrect reference to which Arab party supported Yair Lapid's government, and to better explain how Lapid could get the mandate to form a new one.

The world leaders who refuse to leave the stage,2022-10-27,"George Washington knew when to cede power. But many of today's global leaders find it much harder to leave the stage — and could do with a dose of the first US President's humility. Some have no desire to quit. Others are desperate to claw back the clout they once had. The result is an era of stasis in already repressive nations like Russia and China, and déjà vu in democracies where ex-leaders seem to be putting narcissistic considerations above national interests. ""I will probably have to do it again,"" said former President Donald Trump — he of the two impeachments and the US Capitol insurrection — to supporters baying for a second term this weekend. Boris Johnson (once referred to as ""Britain Trump"" by the ex-POTUS) just mounted his own comeback bid and failed —though anyone who thinks he's given up on emulating his hero Winston Churchill, who returned as Prime Minister six years after losing the 1945 election, is surely mistaken. Democracy is hanging by a thread in Brazil, where President Jair Bolsonaro has hinted he may not accept defeat in his quest for a second term in this weekend's run-off vote. His rival is another retread — Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the former two-time president known as ""Lula"" whose return to the spotlight detoured through a partial jail term (his conviction was later annulled). Some of the current comeback kids have been on the world stage since the 1990s. In Italy, three-time former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is back in parliament after a tax fraud scandal, though his attempt to play kingmaker in coalition talks dissolved after he boasted about his ties with old friend Russian President Vladimir Putin. Another scandal-prone leader trying to recapture past glories is Benjamin Netanyahu, who served so long as prime minister that they dubbed him ""King Bibi."" He is leading in the polls ahead of yet another Israeli general election. Of course, one alternative to making a comeback is never going away. Putin himself has been in power since December 31, 1999 — though had to spin a scam in which he was ""demoted"" to prime minister for a number of years as the power behind the throne before returning as President. And in China, Xi Jinping just cemented a norm-busting third term in office. Exhausted after two terms, and disillusioned by bitter, partisan politics, Washington passed on a third term in office in 1796. He told Americans that he was ""persuaded, whatever partiality may be retained for my services, that in the present circumstances of our country you will not disapprove my determination to retire."" Not words you hear very often these days.","{'neg': 0.327, 'neu': 0.673, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.34}",18,66.0,0.0,0.881,0.119,0.4767,0.105,0.815,0.08,-0.9266,8.5806,70.77006090909089,254.0,0.27862228704366493
5 ways the Israel-Lebanon maritime deal matters,2022-10-12,"Amid decades of hostility, Lebanon and Israel on Tuesday reached a historic maritime border deal, finally demarcating a disputed area in the Mediterranean Sea that is believed to be rich in oil and gas. The deal opens doors to exploration and drilling when gas prices are skyrocketing amid a global supply crunch stemming from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  Still technically at war, Lebanon and Israel both have much to gain from the deal. From income relief peering over the horizon for an economically shattered Lebanon, to a vital win for Israel's Yair Lapid government ahead of next month's elections, the agreement should bear fruit for both parties.   It is also a regional victory for the Biden administration, which lately has seen diplomatic tensions rise with some of its Middle East allies, especially those in the Gulf. With the possibility of much needed gas from the Mediterranean and averting a potential security crisis between historic enemies, the United States notched an important win in a region where its influence has seemingly diminished.    While there are limitations to the deal, it is perceived as a step forward on more than one front. Here are five ways the landmark maritime border deal between Israel and Lebanon matters:   1) A security crisis averted, for now   Under dispute for years, the 860-square-kilometer area of the Mediterranean potentially harbors billions of dollars' worth of oil and gas. Tensions worsened earlier this year when, in June, a London-based vessel arrived to develop a gas field for Israel.   Although the rig itself is positioned south of the disputed area, the field it is exploring stretches across what was one of Lebanon's southernmost claimed lines, prompting Lebanon to warn Israel against ""aggressive action"" in the disputed waters.   Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Lebanese militant group, later vowed an ""escalation"" if its rights were not met in the deal, and in July even sent drones toward the gas rig as a ""message"" to Israel.  Rhetoric from some Lebanese parliamentarians had even used the word ""war"" to describe a no-deal situation, and just days before the agreement, Israel's defense minister instructed his troops to ""prepare for any scenario in which tensions increase in the northern arena -- including defense and offense readiness.""  While both parties beat the battle drums, analysts are skeptical that the dispute would have erupted into full-blown war.   ""I'm not sure Hezbollah wanted to go to war,"" said Lebanese energy expert Laury Haytayan. ""It was just trying to get a better deal.""   Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid said that the agreement strengthens Israel's security, will boost its economy and ""ensure the stability of our northern border.""  While the deal is a win for both sides, future security threats are not likely to be eliminated by the maritime agreement, said Elai Rettig, assistant professor in the Department of Political Studies at Bar-Ilan University in Tel Aviv.     2) Lebanon sees potential economic relief   Beyond the security hurdles that exploration and drilling companies faced in the area, the deal could mark the beginning of a key source of income for Lebanon's crippled economy.   With little to no government cohesion, Lebanon is now in its fourth year of financial meltdown.  The maritime border agreement reached Tuesday will be a ""gamechanger"" for crisis-hit Lebanon, top negotiator and Lebanese Deputy Speaker Elias Bou Saab told CNN's Becky Anderson on Tuesday.   ""People will start talking to Lebanon again,"" Bou Saab said, adding that said the deal will give Lebanon's youth ""hope"" and create more trust in the international community.   Under the US-brokered deal, Lebanon would be able to begin gas exploration in the Qanaa prospect -- which lays within Lebanon's exploration block but crosses over into Israeli waters. The Qanaa gas field is yet to be explored, but Lebanon believes it is rich with resources.   Under a consortium led by Total, the French energy company, Lebanon would be able to explore and drill in Qanaa while paying royalties to Israel should gas be found.  While the agreement is a positive step for Lebanon's economy, substantial economic relief is not expected to emerge overnight, said Rettig. ""Right now, it is all a potential,"" he told CNN.   ""The more positive sense is that if Lebanon can close this deal and show that it is open for business, and Total comes in and starts looking, it can invigorate the market,"" said Rettig, noting that it could bring in more investments amid promises of better stability and security.   If Total does indeed begin exploration for the Lebanese, it could also offer incentives for other companies to apply to do the same, said Haytayan, adding that with these prospects in mind, it is yet to be seen what the direct economic impacts will be.       3) Israel can help ease Europe's gas shortage   Europe's gas crisis is only deepening. Governments are doing all they can to shield consumers from price shocks, but the crisis took a further dip after explosions damaged Nord Stream 1 and 2 last month. The Nord Stream 1 pipeline was Europe's main source of Russian gas.   Israel has said that, once a maritime deal is signed with Lebanon, it can begin extracting oil and gas from its Karish field and export it to Europe within weeks.  Lapid has repeatedly spoken about the role Israel can play to help Europe as Western countries try to wean themselves off Russian energy.   While Israel's gas field is ready, Lebanon's is lagging far behind. Bou Saab said that Lebanon might see gas in three or four years once Total begins its work in Qana.   ""For now, Lebanon is not the market that Europeans are looking for,"" said Haytayan, noting that the Levantine country needs years of infrastructure building to be able to find and exploit any gas.    4) A win for the Biden administration  US President Joe Biden and his administration have had a heated year with their Middle East allies, particularly Saudi Arabia.  Relations hit a new low last week when the oil cartel OPEC+, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, defied the US with the largest output cut since the pandemic. The oil production slash only brought added pressure for Biden.   US mediation efforts were key to achieving the Israel-Lebanon maritime deal after previous administrations' failed attempts, and analysts say this bolsters the Biden administration ahead of US midterm elections.     5) An eleventh-hour agreement with Lebanon ahead of Israeli elections  Israel is just three weeks away from elections, its fifth in less than four years.  The November 1 vote may pave the way for the re-emergence of former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to take back power, unseating the current centrist caretaker Prime Minister Lapid.  Lapid has hailed the agreement as ""historic"" and a win for Israel on security and economic grounds.   ""It is a deal with an enemy state,"" Rettig told CNN, adding that it compels Lebanon, which does not recognize the state of Israel, to de facto recognize Israel's existence on an official level and its maritime border.  But Netanyau and his allies are framing the deal as a ""surrender"" driven by Hezbollah's threats, noted Rettig, the Tel Aviv political scientist.  So while Lapid may hope the deal will be a political win for him, it could yet backfire if the opposition's view catches on with Israeli voters.  ""Hezbollah will use billions from the gas to arm itself with missiles and rockets against Israeli citizens, and Iran will position itself in front of Rosh HaNikra (a kibbutz in northern Israel) and in front of Israel's gas reserves,"" Netanyahu tweeted.  Iran protests Multiple strikes by oil contract workers have been taking place across Iran in different petrochemical complexes in support of the ongoing protests, according to a statement from the Organizing Council of Oil Contractor Workers.    On Tuesday, workers protested at the Abadan Oil Refining Company in the southwestern city of Abadan, according to a statement from the council. Abadan Oil Refinery is one of the largest refineries in Iran, according to the semiofficial news outlet IRNA.     Strikes also occurred on Monday in Hengam, Damavand, and Kangan petrochemical complexes, in the Busher province, as well as the Kavian petrochemical complex in Tehran, the Organizing Council reported. Eleven workers have been arrested so far, the Council said in a separate statement.    Workers' strikes in Iran, and specifically oil and gas workers' strikes, have historically led to collective labor action, a crucial factor in the removal of the Shah of Iran in the leadup to the 1979 Islamic Revolution.   Here is the latest on this developing story:   Former US President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama on Tuesday said they stood in solidarity with Iranian women amid the nationwide protests, according to a statement posted on the couple's Twitter accounts.  
Iranian Interior Minister Ahmad Vahidi on Tuesday said the uprising in Iran was being orchestrated by foreign-supported ""terrorist organizations"" hiding in northern Iraq, reported IRNA.  
Iran's Foreign Ministry on Monday summoned the UK Ambassador to Iran Simon Shercliff for the third time in a month after the United Kingdom announced sanctions against its morality police and top officials on Monday, according to the Iranian state-owned network Press TV. 
The mother of Nika Shahkarami, a 16-year-old-protester who was found dead in Tehran, denied that her daughter fell from a roof, according to interviews with Iranian newspaper Etemad, BBC Persian and a video message published by US-funded Radio Farda.   The digest  UAE President MBZ visits Putin in Russia  United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed al-Nahyan met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in St. Petersburg on Tuesday.   Background: ""This was a prescheduled official trip which was supposed to focus mostly on bilateral issues but the recent escalation in the war in Ukraine has given this trip added impetus,"" the UAE's presidential adviser Anwar Gargash told CNN on Tuesday.  
Why it matters: This visit comes less than a week after OPEC+, the international cartel of oil producers, announced a significant cut to output in an effort to raise oil prices. The UAE is a member of the organization led by Saudi Arabia and Russia. An intense pressure campaign by the US to dissuade its Arab allies from the cut ahead of the decision failed.    Biden says it is time to ""rethink"" Saudi-US relations  US President Joe Biden told CNN's Jake Tapper during an exclusive interview that he believed it was time to ""rethink"" the US relationship with Saudi Arabia after the kingdom partnered with Russia to cut oil production, a rebuke after intensive White House efforts to prevent such a decision.

Opinion: Jared Kushner settles a few scores,2022-08-29,"In the Trump White House, Jared and Ivanka Kushner were famously referred to as ""the interns."" Now, Jared Kushner has written a book about his internship, modestly titled ""Breaking History,"" in which he casts himself as a diplomatic genius -- a latter-day Metternich with a solid dose of Henry Kissinger thrown in. Describing his time in government, he writes: ""Humbled by the complexity of the task, I orchestrated some of the most significant breakthroughs in diplomacy in the last fifty years."" And that's just in the preface. The nearly 500 pages that follow are rife with this kind of self-congratulatory puffery.   To be fair, Kushner was arguably the most important person in the Trump administration after his mercurial father-in-law. But that was less about his abilities and more because he was one of the very few people -- along with his wife and Olympic-level sycophant Vice President Mike Pence -- who had seemingly guaranteed job security in an administration known for its rapidly revolving door. At the Trump White House, Kushner was allowed to dabble in pretty much anything he wanted, while never officially taking responsibility for many of those roles -- an enviable position to be in when things didn't go well. He took over the portfolios of China, Mexico, the Middle East and NAFTA. When the coronavirus hit, he became one of the de facto Covid-19 leaders as well. By Kushner's own account, he performed brilliantly in all of these gigs, a fact that, in his view, would be more widely recognized if only other senior administration officials hadn't been so incapable of appreciating his inestimable talents.  Kushner recounts an episode in which Trump's chief strategist, Steve Bannon, and Trump's chief of staff, Reince Priebus, supposedly drafted a resignation letter for Kushner to sign. Kushner takes the opportunity to settle some scores with a number of those top officials, including Bannon, former Trump chief of staff John Kelly, former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Kushner's real-world experience before entering the White House was running his family real estate company. In that role, he presided over what was arguably the worst real estate deal in Manhattan's history: Buying 666 Fifth Avenue for a record $1.8 billion in 2007, which became a financial albatross when the recession hit a short time later.  Kushner also purchased the New York Observer, which he reportedly used to attempt to undermine his rivals and suppress unflattering stories about his cronies. The Observer went entirely digital in 2016, and CNN reported at the time that its influence had ""diminished"" since Kushner had taken it over.   Never mind those failures: When Trump took the White House, Kushner became the go-to guy on an ever-widening set of portfolios. On NAFTA, which Trump called ""the worst trade deal ever,"" Kushner inserted himself into the re-negotiations around the trade accord. But, in the end, the deal that he struck, which was rebranded as the United States Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA),was a lot like the old NAFTA.  The new deal included relatively minor changes, such as opening up the Canadian market to US dairy farmers and requiring automobiles to have a higher percentage (75% instead of 62.5%) of their components manufactured in the three countries in order to qualify for zero tariffs.  Kushner presented the USMCA as momentous (""I helped renegotiate the largest trade deal in history"") despite the fact that the changes between NATFA and USMCA were ""mostly cosmetic,"" according to a Brookings Institution analysis of the new deal.  The Abraham Accords Kushner can certainly count the ""Abraham Accords"" as an achievement, given that two small Gulf monarchies, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain, signed deals recognizing the state of Israel for the first time during the Trump administration. Kosovo, Morocco and Sudan all forged ties with Israel as well.  But the Abraham Accords hardly compare with the 1978 Camp David Accords that then-President Jimmy Carter brokered between Egypt and Israel, two countries that had been at war for decades. The UAE and Bahrain, meanwhile, had never fought a war with Israel, and the fact that they normalized relations with the Jewish state was more about creating a coalition against their common enemy Iran than Kushner's brilliant negotiations. Yet, Kushner recounts his role with blustering bravado: ""Getting this deal done was like trying to land a plane on an aircraft carrier in the middle of a storm."" Alrighty. A key part of Kushner's plan to bring peace to the Palestinian territories was to secure $50 billion of investment for Palestinian projects. But both the Palestinians and the Israelis boycotted the much-ballyhooed Palestinian investment conference that Kushner hosted in Bahrain in June 2019.  And there doesn't seem to be evidence that Kushner's investment plans ever came to fruition.   Kushner also seems to have forgotten the original purpose of why he took up the ""peace process."" It was purportedly to bring about a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians.  Kushner seemed to be operating on the theory that normalizing relations between Israel and the Arab states would cause the Arab countries to push the Palestinians to agree to a two-state solution. Providing significant Arab investment in the Palestinian territories would also help sweeten the deal. But none of that worked and by the end of the Trump administration, the two-state solution seemed more a mirage than ever. Meanwhile, the Trump administration gave then Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu -- an old family friend of the Kushners -- pretty much everything he wanted: pulling out of the Iranian nuclear deal, reversing American policy and declaring that it did not consider Israeli settlements in the West Bank a violation of international law and withdrawing US support for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which among other things, educated hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinian kids living as refugees in countries around the Middle East.  The Crown Prince Trump's first overseas visit was to Saudi Arabia, a trip that Kushner had pushed hard for. Shortly after the trip, the Saudis imposed a blockade on Qatar, which had long found their enormously wealthy neighbor to be an irritant. The Saudis knew that with President Barack Obama in the White House, a blockade of Qatar likely wouldn't fly, but the Trump-Kushner team was another matter.  It's unclear whether Trump and Kushner were either unaware or simply didn't care that Qatar sits on some of the largest natural gas reserves in the world and is also home to the largest US military base in the Middle East.  The two Trump cabinet officials who knew the most about Qatar, Tillerson, who was previously the chairman and CEO of Exxon, and then-Secretary of Defense James Mattis, who had commanded CENTCOM, were both angered by the blockade. But Kushner sidelined them both on the Qatar issue.  Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as MBS, knew that the one person who really counted in all this was Kushner, who had his back. The absolute Gulf monarchies who run their fiefdoms as family businesses had a shrewd understanding of where the power really resided in the Trump administration.  Kushner's relationship with MBS, who the CIA concluded ordered the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, has certainly proven lucrative. Against the advice of its own board of advisers, a Saudi sovereign wealth fund led by MBS reportedly invested $2 billion in Kushner's newly formed private equity firm just six months after Trump left office. This extraordinarily cushy deal goes unmentioned in Kushner's very long book.  Prison Reform In fairness to Kushner, he certainly did get some things right. One of most important events in his adult life was, inarguably, the imprisonment of his father Charles Kushner, who was convicted of witness tampering and several other charges after he hired a prostitute to seduce his brother-in-law in a New Jersey hotel room while a hidden camera rolled.  As part of the revenge plot, he then sent the tape to his own sister, who along with her husband, had been cooperating with the feds in an investigation into Charles Kushner's campaign contributions. He was sentenced to two years, and his son movingly describes visiting his father every weekend at the Alabama prison where he was incarcerated.  Given this personal experience, Kushner campaigned for prison reform during his time in the Trump White House and helped create a coalition with Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois and CNN commentator Van Jones, among others, to move this bipartisan measure through Congress. The resulting reforms helped address some of the disparities in sentencing between crack cocaine convictions and powder cocaine offenses that tended to penalize Black offenders  It also lowered mandatory minimum sentences for non-violent crimes and gave judges the leeway to dole out more lenient sentences to those who deserved them. Covid-19 Kushner also deserves credit for helping orchestrate the Trump administration's vaccination program, known as ""Operation Warp Speed,"" during the pandemic. The government invested $1 billion in Moderna, which produced a testable vaccine in just a matter of months and placed another $1.5 billion order for 100 million doses of the vaccine.  And while Pfizer didn't directly take US government money in the research phase, the administration did strike an advance-purchase deal with the company to obtain more than 100 million doses for $1.95 billion.   Yet, Kushner never grapples with his father-in-law's role as a one-man super-spreader of lies and disinformation. This surely contributed to many unnecessary deaths during the pandemic, given Trump's influence on his supporters and the key role that the president's bully pulpit plays in American life.  Early on, Trump repeatedly downplayed the severity of the pandemic, saying the virus would ""go away"" or ""disappear."" Trump also denigrated mask-wearing and almost invariably refused to wear a mask himself at a time when vaccines were not yet available and masks were one of the most effective ways to curb the spread of the virus. Dr. Deborah Birx, Trump's coronavirus response coordinator, told a House select subcommittee that that the Trump administration's botched response to Covid-19 proved lethal for many tens of thousands of Americans. If the administration had followed the science and implemented more mitigation measures, she testified, ""We probably could have decreased fatalities into the 30-percent-less to 40-percent-less range."" Kushner also gives his father-in-law a free pass on spreading falsehoods about the 2020 election being stolen from him. At one point, Kushner writes th","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",64,68.0,0.033,0.815,0.153,0.8957,0.077,0.827,0.096,0.9818,57.3248,101.44789999999999,258.0,0.39320891472868214
Why Hamas stayed out of the latest Gaza conflict,2022-08-08,"One of the most important aspects of the weekend's short but violent conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) was what didn't happen: Hamas' involvement.     A ceasefire between Israel and the PIJ over Gaza that went into effect at 11:30 p.m. local time (4:30 p.m. ET) Sunday appeared to be holding almost 24 hours later. The conflict led to the death of at least 44 militants and civilians in Gaza, according to information from the Palestinian Ministry of Health. Fifteen of the dead were children. Israel insists most of those killed were militants, and that several civilians were killed by failed militant rocket launches.    Hamas, the militant group that runs Gaza, expressed support for the PIJ's actions. But it kept its much larger and more powerful arsenal of rockets out of the equation, while Israel's military made it clear from the outset they were focusing solely on PIJ targets.    That kept the conflict from spiraling into a larger, more dangerous confrontation, and closer to what happened during the 11-day war in May 2021.     So why not get involved? According to analysts and Israeli officials, one reason is the fact it is still only 15 months since the 2021 conflict that led to considerable damage and death in Gaza. Palestinians there are still rebuilding their homes, and Hamas is rebuilding its arsenal.     The Israeli government also believes its campaign of economic incentives -- boosting the number of permits given to Gazans to cross into Israel for work -- is succeeding.     Israel and Egypt have imposed a closure on Gaza since 2007, limiting access to the territory via land, air and sea, including tight restrictions on the movement of residents and the flow of goods.      If rockets are fired, Israel closes the border and the thousands of Gazans with permits can't work in Israel or get paid.     On Monday, a senior Israeli diplomatic official said Hamas was ""an enemy not a partner ... but there is cooperation we can do, predominantly through Egypt, to improve the situation in Gaza.""   For showing restraint, Hamas will expect to be rewarded.   Lapid's first big security test   The weekend's conflict was also the first major military test for interim Prime Minister Yair Lapid. Unlike his predecessor Naftali Bennett, Lapid is not known for his military combat experience. But like US President Joe Biden's visit last month, it was another moment for Lapid to look like a real prime minister — images Lapid likely hopes Israelis remember as they had to the polls in November.    The conflict also brought about another breakthrough, albeit on a somewhat smaller scale: former prime minister, now opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu met with Lapid on Sunday to receive a security briefing on the operation. It was his first security briefing since leaving power -- even though by law it is supposed to be standard practice. Until this weekend, Netanyahu had boycotted the meetings.    After the meeting, Netanyahu said he supported the operation and gave his ""full backing to the government, the IDF, and the security forces.""    Parts of Gaza once again lie in rubble and the mourning continues for lost lives, but for everyday Israelis and Gazans, the conflict hasn't led to a substantial change in the political situation on the ground.     The digest Russia envoy to Iran nuclear talks says they are ""moving in right direction""  Ambassador Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia's chief negotiator in Vienna for talks aimed at reviving the Iran nuclear deal, on Sunday told media, ""I cannot guarantee [anything], but the impression is that we are moving in the right direction."" He said there were ""minimal"" unresolved issues, ""just 3 [or] 4.""    Background: Tehran ramped up uranium enrichment at a pace not seen since the signing of the 2015 nuclear deal. Former US President Donald Trump withdrew from that agreement in 2018. In June, Iran switched off surveillance cameras used by the International Atomic Energy Agency to monitor activity at the country's key nuclear facilities. Sunday marked the fourth day of this latest round -- the nineth -- of the Iran nuclear talks.  
Why it matters: Talks broke down earlier this year over Tehran's insistence that the US remove the Revolutionary Guards from its list of terrorist organizations, which the US has refused to do. The US did however send Special Envoy for Iran Rob Malley to Vienna for the new round of talks, and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken last Monday said that the US is ""prepared to move forward on the basis of what's been agreed,"" but it is unclear if Iran is prepared to do the same.    Putin, Erdogan agree to begin partial payment in rubles for Russian gas  Bilateral talks in Sochi between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan included an agreement to pay Russia in rubles for partial gas supplies. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said the two presidents reached agreements on establishing a financial banking bloc ""to enable commercial companies, Russian citizens, to pay during tourist trips and exchange money.""  Background: Russia has been trying to force its customers to pay for energy in rubles. President Vladimir Putin signed a decree in March that requires buyers of natural gas from ""unfriendly countries"" to hold accounts at Gazprombank — Russia's third-largest bank — and settle contracts in rubles. 
Why it matters: Russia is on a mission to prove it's not as isolated as the US would like it to be. Tightening relations between Putin and Erdogan may provide Russia with routes to ease the pressure of western sanctions on the country. The ruble crashed to a record low in the wake of the invasion, but it is the world's best-performing currency this year, according to Reuters. The central bank has implemented policies to prevent investors and companies from selling the currency and other measures that force them to buy it. Iran city reaches 53 degrees Celsius, hottest temperature in the world this year  Abadan, Iran had a high temperature of 53.0° C (127.4° F) Friday -- the highest temperature recorded anywhere in the world in 2022, according to weather historian Maximiliano Herrera.      Background: Numerous locations across Iran, Iraq and Kuwait topped 50 degrees Celsius Friday. Temperatures were expected to drop back closer to average after the weekend, with highs in the mid to upper 40s Celsius. The highest temperature ever recorded in the world is 56.7° C (134.1° F) in Death Valley, California, on July 10, 1913. 
Why it matters: Heat of this caliber raises major concerns for heat-related illness, especially for those without access to water and proper shelter and is likely to bolster arguments for action on climate change.  What's trending   Kuwait: #Wage_rise_is_a_public_demand   The citizens of one of the richest Arab countries are demanding a rise in wages.  Kuwaitis took to Twitter to express their frustration at the country's economic situation, blaming official corruption and greed for alleged inequality in pay.   Kuwaiti citizens are a minority in the country of 4.2 million, making up just 30% of the population, according to World Population Review. Most rely on government jobs to make a living.   ""It's inconceivable that a rich country like Kuwait that has a small number of people and the strongest currency in the world [wouldn't raise wages],"" tweeted Mohammed Al Huwaishel. ""The demands of the people must be met without conditions.""  Many Kuwaitis take government jobs -- where pay can be up to 28% higher than the private sector -- because they either lack the necessary skills to work in the private sector or because some of those jobs are seen as menial, according to the Middle East Institute.  Due to the benefits offered in government jobs, the private sector finds it difficult to lure Kuwaitis. According to the International Monetary Fund, public wages and benefits account for one-third of the government's budget. The government set aside $72 billion in spending for its latest budget.   The World Bank warned in December that the government's wage bill is unsustainable, saying that if the situation continues, the country's financial reserves will be depleted. The nation has made the least progress among oil-rich Gulf Arab countries to reform its wage bill and has even increased hiring, it said.   Another hashtag on Twitter called on the government to write off citizens' debt, which is not without precedent. After the end of the 1991 Gulf War, the government wrote off almost all consumer debt.

Israel's Prime Minister makes rare allusion to country's nuclear weapons arsenal,2022-08-02,"Israel's Prime Minister Yair Lapid made a rare allusion to the country's widely suspected nuclear arsenal during a speech on Monday.  Speaking at an event to mark a change of leadership at the country's Atomic Energy Commission, Lapid referred to Israel's defensive and offensive capabilities, as well as what he called its ""other capabilities"" -- understood to be a reference to nuclear weapons.   ""The operational arena in the invisible dome above us is built on defensive capabilities and offensive capabilities, and what the foreign media tends to call 'other capabilities.' These other capabilities keep us alive and will keep us alive so long as we and our children are here,"" Lapid said.  Israel is widely believed to possess a few hundred nuclear weapons, developing the technology in the 1960s. Unlike most assumed nuclear weapons states, Israel has never formally declared possession.  Instead it pursues a policy of 'opacity' -- meaning Israeli leaders, when pushed, have preferred to make only oblique or ambiguous reference to nukes.   The first such statement was made in the early 1960s by then junior defense minister Shimon Peres who said that Israel would ""certainly not be the first to introduce nuclear weapons into the region.""  More recently, former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert appeared to acknowledge the nuclear capability when he listed Israel, along with the United States, Russia and France, as having nuclear weapons, though he later attempted to row back the comments, which were made on German television.  Benjamin Netanyahu too once referred to Israel as a ""nuclear power"" during a presentation to his Cabinet, before he corrected himself to say ""energy power.""

Why Joe Biden's fist bump with MBS was such a disaster,2022-07-17,"In the weeks leading up to President Joe Biden's trip to the Middle East, one question dominated: Would he meet with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman? And, if he did, what would his demeanor be? After all, MBS had been linked by the US intelligence community directly to the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul in 2018. The report, which the Biden administration released in February 2021, concluded that MBS had ""approved"" the operation that led to Khashogggi's death. And, as a candidate, Biden had struck a hard line with the Saudis. In one of the 2020 presidential debates, he was unequivocal in his denunciation of the Saudis for their role in Khashoggi's death. ""We [are] going to, in fact, make them pay the price, and make them, in fact, the pariah that they are,"" Biden pledged. Given all that, there was reason to wonder how Biden would play all of this. On Thursday, the White House confirmed, as expected, that Biden would in fact meet with MBS -- and would bring up the killing of Khashoggi. ""My views on Khashoggi have been made absolutely, positively clear, and I have never been quiet about asking about human rights,"" Biden said. In defending himself against the seeming contradiction of calling the country a ""pariah"" less than two years ago and then granting Saudi leaders exactly what they wanted -- an audience with the American president -- Biden explained: ""There are so many issues at stake that I want to make clear that we can continue to lead in the region and not create a vacuum -- a vacuum that is filled by China and or Russia, against the interest of both Israel and the United States and many other countries."" Which, well, OK? What Biden didn't mention was the elephant in the room: Saudi Arabia has oil -- lots and lots of it -- that the United States needs. That's always been true, but it is even more true with Biden pledging not to import any oil from Russia due to its invasion of Ukraine. (Gas prices have come down somewhat from their highs of a month ago but remain elevated.) But, all of that pales in comparison to how Biden ultimately handled the meet-and-greet with MBS. The two men fist-bumped, a bro-ey move of perceived friendship and camaraderie that gave the Saudi leader exactly what he wanted: A door to return back into international good graces. As the BBC noted: ""The Saudis knew the world would be watching this meeting. ""They wanted the rest of the Middle East, and the international community, to sit up and take notice of the favour they had been granted by the US president."" Need evidence that the Saudis were thrilled with fist bump? They quickly moved to share the image around social media to ensure that everyone saw it. Fred Ryan, the publisher of The Washington Post, was heavily critical of the decision by the Biden team -- calling the fist bump ""shameful."" He added: ""It projected a level of intimacy and comfort that delivers to MBS the unwarranted redemption he has been desperately seeking."" California Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff was similarly critical. ""If we ever needed a visual reminder of the continuing grip oil-rich autocrats have on U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, we got it today,"" he tweeted. ""One fist bump is worth a thousand words."" What's so remarkable -- and remarkably bad -- about the fist bump is that, as I mentioned above, the Biden team has had oodles of time to prepare for this meeting with MBS. Like, it was not a surprise that Biden and MBS were going to meet -- and that the Saudis would seek to leverage the meeting in every way possible. My guess is that the White House will note that Biden did a lot of fist-bumping -- as opposed to handshakes -- during his visit as a way to keep his risk of contracting Covid-19 lower. Which, well, OK. It's worth noting that a) Biden shook hands with former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and b) there is plenty of hand sanitizer to be had if Biden did shake hands with MBS. Symbolism matters -- deeply -- in foreign affairs. Biden, from his many years in the Senate and his time as vice president, knows this. Which makes the fist bump decision all the more confounding.","{'neg': 0.313, 'neu': 0.687, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.6249}",32,71.0,0.073,0.706,0.221,0.743,0.054,0.84,0.106,0.9907,23.776,87.81899999999999,227.0,0.3868678414096916
Opinion: Biden's risky fist bump with MBS,2022-07-17,"Are presidential fist bumps a sign of distance or closeness? The Biden administration may have thought that by avoiding a handshake with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as MBS, the President could dampen any criticism for meeting the de facto ruler of a nation he once vowed to shun. (The White House had said the fist bumps were an effort to reduce physical contact on his trip to the Middle East, although Biden broke out the handshakes for former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and clasped hands with a pair of Holocaust survivors earlier in his trip.)   The administration was wrong on that count, but it was right in anticipating the level of attention the greeting would draw. After all, the world was gripped by then-President Donald Trump's unusually long handshakes with a bewildered Japanese prime minister and a competitive French president. Handshakes -- or their stand-ins -- can be weighty diplomatic theater. But Joe Biden's Saudi trip has been much more than theater. It has been a high stakes gambit filled with urgent, concrete objectives, and Biden had greater aims than simply lowering gas prices for Americans in order to boost his own political standing, as so many suggest.    This meeting was more about Kyiv than Kenosha; more about Tehran than Toledo. The controversy over meeting MBS had already exploded before Biden landed in Jeddah for a trip that was timed to coincide with a regional summit of nine Arab countries in an effort to strengthen US leadership in the region. But it was the meeting with MBS that produced the most caustic criticism. The brash 36-year-old's ruthlessness was never a secret, but the depth of his cruelty shocked even the most jaded realists in 2018 when his agents lured, murdered and dismembered the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a critic of the regime. US intelligence concluded that MBS had ordered the assassination. He denies it. (Disclosure: Khashoggi was a contributing columnist at the Washington Post, as am I.) As a presidential candidate aiming to challenge Trump, who had unquestioningly embraced many of the world's most brutal dictators, including MBS, Biden vowed to treat the Saudis like pariahs. Initially, Biden kept his word. He would communicate solely with Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, according to the White House, denying MBS the recognition as de facto ruler. Biden also declassified the CIA report implicating MBS in Khashoggi's murder. But then the world changed. Russia invaded Ukraine, initiating what has become a devastating war of attrition. Russia has been accused of massacring civilians, including countless children; it has also created millions of refugees, destroyed infrastructure and captured Ukrainian territories. Soaring food prices threaten to cause mass starvation. Oil prices, too, skyrocketed, with grave consequences. Biden mobilized the Western alliance to support Ukraine as more European countries, including Finland and Sweden, asked to join North Atlantic Treaty Organization for fear that Russia would one day target them. Vladimir Putin's threats went so far as to suggest that countries that once belonged to the USSR -- three of which are now NATO members -- should still be ruled by Moscow.  Russia's aggression, in other words, extends far beyond Ukraine. It could not be allowed to be succeed. Enter Saudi Arabia. Washington's relationship with Saudi Arabia has always been a morally disturbing one. It requires a distasteful weighing of principles against interests.  Since President Franklin Delano Roosevelt met with King Ibn Saud in 1945, striking a deal to provide arms and security in exchange for a reliable supply of oil, every US president has maintained relations with their Saudi counterparts, often traveling to the kingdom to establish stronger ties. Barack Obama, incidentally, holds the record, going four times during his presidency. FDR, remember, met with Joseph Stalin, a mass murdering Soviet leader, during World War II because he thought they could join forces to defeat Hitler, the greatest threat. To defeat the Nazis, Roosevelt reportedly said, he ""would hold hands with the devil."" MBS is not the devil and Putin is not Hitler. The point is that sometimes leaders need to hold their noses and come together with figures they'd much rather shun. What's key here is that Saudi Arabia plays a crucial role in bolstering the West's support for Ukraine. Regionally, the kingdom is an important force in trying to contain the Iranian regime. And, longer term, maintaining ties with MBS is about keeping the global balance of power on the side of the US, rather than China.   When it comes to oil, the US doesn't need Saudi Arabia to keep its economy afloat. The US has become the world's top oil producer. But Saudi holds one of the largest reserves, and the ability to increase the supply of oil and gas would lower prices worldwide, which could indirectly determine the outcome of the war in Ukraine. To defeat Putin, Ukraine needs sustained Western support. If oil prices remain high and the global economy plunges into recession, popular approval for helping Ukraine may not last. Europeans struggling to pay heating bills this winter may start to question the wisdom of squeezing Russia's vast oil and gas exports, and their discontent could cause their leaders to fold. If Biden had gone to Saudi Arabia on bended knee in order to buoy his approval ratings and scrape a few cents off prices at the pump in the US, the trip would have been a less forgivable sacrifice of principles. But this was a larger geopolitical gambit against an aggressive Russian dictator who is accused of ordering the slaughter of civilians.  It doesn't make the killing of Khashoggi any less appalling, the execution and imprisonment of Saudi critics on what many consider trumped-up charges any less deplorable, or the ""guardianship"" system of Saudi women any less infuriating.  But engaging with Saudi Arabia allows the US to bolster its influence on major global conflicts -- with the  potential to influence the Saudis, too. For one, the US is building a regional bloc, including Israel and several Arab countries, to counter Tehran, which may soon possess nuclear weapons.  And the reality is that MBS is likely to rule the kingdom for decades and the crown prince knows there are alternatives to the US. As MBS noted in a March interview with the Atlantic, if the US pulls away, ""I believe other people in the East are going to be super happy."" The crown prince has been bolstering relations with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in recent years, and reportedly invited him to the kingdom in March, though that visit has not yet occurred.  The West understands the risk. ""We are not going to leave a vacuum in the Middle East for Russia or China to fill,"" Biden declared on Friday. China won't publicly chastise the Saudis for murdering a journalist, as Biden did. They won't discuss ""human rights and the need for political reform,"" as Biden, on Saudi soil, told the entire world he had done. Will the criticism work? Will the trip pay off? We still don't know. We do know that Biden's visit to Saudi Arabia was a victory for MBS, as it granted him the recognition he craves. That's why the palace rushed to broadcast the pictures of Biden fist bumping the prince -- never mind that Biden likely meant it as a sign of chilliness. If the Saudis raise oil and natural gas output, helping ease the price of fuel as the West prepares for winter without Russian gas supplies; if they loosen more restrictions on women; if they allow now-restricted American citizens to leave the country, then we will know it was worth it.  It was a gamble. Let's hope it pays off.","{'neg': 0.231, 'neu': 0.769, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.2023}",66,72.0,0.057,0.943,0.0,-0.4215,0.121,0.776,0.102,-0.9909,-27.819,59.999999999999986,229.0,0.2620087336244541
Biden tries to ease worries over US commitment to the Middle East in meetings with key leaders,2022-07-16,"President Joe Biden on Saturday attempted to reassert US leadership in the Middle East as he met with key leaders in the region, promising his administration would stay engaged amid fears China and Russia would swiftly fill a leadership vacuum.  The President said American leadership in the Middle East would focus on using diplomacy to strengthen alliances and build coalitions, and that the US' objectives would remain ""focused, realistic and achievable.""  His speech comes nearly one year after the US withdrew all military troops from Afghanistan and ended 20 years of war in the country. He noted his visit to the Middle East was the first time since the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001 that a US President visited the region without American troops being engaged in combat in the region, though US forces continue to conduct operations in Syria.  Biden's foreign policy since taking office has largely focused on countering China's growing geopolitical influence and Russia's war in Ukraine, which has raised questions about the extent of the President's commitment to engagement in the Middle East. But on Saturday at a summit in Jeddah, the President sought to assure other Middle Eastern leaders -- and the rest of the world -- that the US still sees the region as crucial to its foreign policy goals.  ""Let me state clearly that the United States is going to remain an active and engaged partner in the Middle East,"" Biden said at a summit attended by key leaders on the last day of his Middle East swing.  The President said, ""As the world grows more competitive, and the challenges we face more complex, it is only becoming clearer to me how closely interwoven our interests are with the successes of the Middle East. We will not walk away and leave a vacuum to be filled by China, Russia, or Iran."" The President announced $1 billion in aid to food security assistance in the Middle East and North Africa on Saturday. The President also announced Gulf Arab leaders are pledging more than $3 billion over the next two years in projects that align with global infrastructure and investment.   The President said the US would focus on supporting countries ""that subscribe to a rules-based international order,"" including helping those countries defend themselves against foreign threats. He thanked the leaders present for voting to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine at the UN General Assembly and called it a ""watershed moment"" that showed ""the core values"" of the region. He spoke of the importance of protecting the ""freedom of navigation"" through waterways in the Middle East, which allows for the free flow of commerce and resources throughout the region. Biden said the US has established a new naval task force to work in partnership with Middle Eastern countries to help secure the Red Sea.  Biden said the US would ""work to reduce tensions, deescalate and end conflicts wherever possible."" He pointed to the truce in Yemen -- its first nationwide truce in six years -- as an example of successful diplomacy. He again vowed to never let Iran acquire a nuclear weapon.  The President also touched on human rights as he sat beside Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, calling the values enshrined in the UN charter ""foundational to who we are as Americans."" ""I've gotten plenty of criticism over the years. It's not fun. But the ability to speak openly, exchange ideas freely, is what unlocks innovation,"" Biden said.  Biden held several bilateral meetings with leaders from Iraq, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, and participated in a GCC+ 3 summit on Saturday. The GCC+ 3 is made up of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) -- an alliance of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman -- plus Egypt, Iraq and Jordan. He departed Saudi Arabia for Washington after wrapping up his meetings. Large parts of the region have been embroiled in economic turmoil in recent years exacerbated by the pandemic. Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Moscow's stifling of Ukraine's vast wheat exports have also pushed much of the Middle East and North Africa to the brink of wide-scale food insecurity.  Biden came to Jeddah seeking solutions to one of his top political problems at home -- sky-high gas prices -- as diplomacy with Saudi Arabia in the Middle East was seen as one of the few routes he could take to bring down prices that are putting strain on millions of Americans.  But White House officials say the President won't be returning to Washington on Saturday with explicit oil production increases. The expectation is that there will be increases in the months ahead -- done within the context of increased output levels in the OPEC+ cartel laid out at its August meeting.  In his remarks to the summit, bin Salman said joint international efforts were needed for the recovery of the global economy and that ""unrealistic policies"" on energy would lead to ""unprecedented inflation."" ""Adopting unrealistic policies to reduce emissions through the exclusion of the main sources of energy, without taking into consideration the impact of these policies on the social and economic pillars of sustainable development and global supply chains, will lead in the coming years to unprecedented inflation, increased fuel prices, increased unemployment and exasperation of dangerous social and security problems including poverty, famine, escalation of crime, extremism and terrorism,"" the Crown Prince said.   Biden's visit to Saudi Arabia has been closely watched. The President announced several new areas of cooperation aimed at reshaping US-Saudi relations on Friday, but it has been his interactions with the Saudi Crown Prince that have drawn the most attention. The US declassified an intelligence report last year that concluded bin Salman approved the killing of Saudi journalist and Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. Despite once vowing to make Saudi Arabia a ""pariah"" on the world stage, Biden fist bumped the Crown Prince upon greeting him in Jeddah ahead of their meetings. Fellow Democrats and others decried the gesture as too friendly and said it sent the wrong message.  Biden later told reporters he raised Khashoggi's killing directly with bin Salman and said he believed the Crown Prince was responsible.  He was met with Saudi pushback, according to a source familiar with the matter. The Crown Prince, the de facto ruler of the kingdom, told Biden any attempt to impose values on another country was viewed as counterproductive to the relationship. He then noted that there have been incidents, including the abuse of prisoners by US military personnel at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, that reflect poorly on the US.  The recent killing of Al Jazeera Shireen Abu Akleh in the West Bank and the US response, which has drawn criticism from Abu Akleh's family, was also brought up by the Saudi side, the source said. Senior administration officials on Saturday defended the trip as an opportunity to raise concerns about the kingdom's rights record with the Saudi crown prince. It would have been ""backsliding if the president didn't come to the region and it would be backsliding if he didn't and wasn't willing to sit and raise human rights concerns with foreign leaders around the world,"" an official said.  Responding to a question on Saturday about the possibility of a widely anticipated Saudi-Israeli normalization agreement, an official said ""it's going to take some time.""  The Biden administration has for months sought to formalize security and economic deals between Saudi Arabia and Israel, in a bid to set the stage for a normalization deal between the two countries. Riyadh is believed to have a covert relationship with Israel but has yet to officially disclose those diplomatic ties. In 2020, then-Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly flew to Saudi Arabia for a covert meeting with the kingdom's de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman -- a claim that was denied by Riyadh's top diplomat. A possible normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia has been hailed as the ""crown jewel"" of agreements between the Jewish state and the Arab world.

Saudi Arabia opens airspace to Israeli flights,2022-07-15,"Saudi Arabia on Friday opened its airspace to all civilian carriers, including all flights to and from Israel, in a step toward normalizing relations between the two nations as US President Joe Biden tours the Middle East. In a statement shared hours before he was due to fly directly from Israel to Saudi Arabia, Biden hailed the kingdom's decision, saying that it could ""help build momentum toward Israel's further integration into the region.""

The kingdom's decision marks the first time it has allowed unlimited use of its airspace by Israeli airlines to fly to and from the country. In recent years, Saudi Arabia has only allowed Israeli airlines flying from Tel Aviv to the UAE and Bahrain through its airspace.  The move fully overturns the decades-long ban on Israeli overflights in Saudi airspace. Israeli airlines flying to Asian routes like India and China previously had to take a detour around Saudi Arabia that added hours to the journey. Saudi's General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA) on Thursday said in a statement that it had decided to open its airspace for all air carriers ""that meet the requirements of the Authority for overflying."" It added that the country is keen ""to fulfill its obligations under the Chicago Convention of 1944, which stipulates non-discrimination between civil aircrafts used in international air navigation.""   Following Saudi's decision, Biden vowed to do all he can ""through direct diplomacy and leader-to-leader engagement, to keep advancing this groundbreaking process."" Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid welcomed the Saudi announcement, which he described as the result of a ""long road of intense and covert diplomacy with Saudi Arabia and the United States."" He said the decision was ""only the first step,"" and promised more was to come in the way of improved relations. Lapid also thanked Biden and wished him success in his summit in Jeddah on Saturday.

A 'Middle East NATO'? Why Iran is closely watching Biden's regional trip,2022-07-15,"United States President Joe Biden is on a landmark trip to the Middle East. One country he won't be visiting, however, is dominating the agenda: Iran.   Biden's itinerary includes just two countries, Israel and Saudi Arabia. Those are Tehran's biggest regional foes, and they are coming closer together than ever before.   The visit comes just weeks after Israel said that it was working with regional partners on an air defense alliance that is led by the US. Israel's Defense Minister Benny Gantz told the Knesset, Israel's parliament, that he hopes the program will ""take another step forward"" during Biden's trip to the region.   Saudi Arabia has been pressuring the US for security guarantees that would contain Iran should nuclear talks fail. The last round of talks in Doha two weeks ago resulted in a standstill, with the US saying Iran added unrelated demands to the table.   Early on Friday, just hours before Biden was due to touch down in the kingdom, Saudi Arabia moved one step closer to normalizing relations with Iran's arch-enemy Israel by opening its airspace to all airlines. Israeli carriers were previously barred from entering Saudi airspace on most flights.    Last month, US lawmakers introduced legislation to create an integrated air defense system to increase cooperation between Israel and its Arab neighbors, including the countries whose leaders Biden will meet in Saudi Arabia this week. The defense system is aimed to protect those states from Iran.    Jordan's King Abdullah, who Biden will meet in Saudi Arabia, said this month he favors joining a ""Middle East NATO"" with like-minded countries, without specifying which.    Iran sees an Arab-Israeli military plan as a provocative move and a threat against its national security, foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanani was cited saying on Saturday by state news agency IRNA. He accused the US of spreading ""Iranophobia"" among regional countries, according to IRNA.    The United Arab Emirates, which has been engaging in direct talks with Tehran , said on Friday that it has no interest in joining an anti-Iran alliance.  ""We are open to cooperation, but not cooperation targeted at any other country in the region, and I specifically mention Iran,"" Anwar Gargash, adviser to the UAE president, told CNN's Becky Anderson. The UAE is in the process of sending an ambassador to Tehran, he added.  Some analysts say that if Iran finds itself being ganged up on by its neighbors, it may retaliate.   An Arab-Israeli military alliance is ""a terrible idea,"" said Trita Parsi, vice-president of the Quincy Institute in Washington, DC, ""because it cements existing divisions in the region and reduces the likelihood of diplomatic breakthroughs."" Such groupings are aimed at organizing the region against a certain state instead of achieving ""true peace,"" Parsi  told CNN.    Previous American attempts at isolating Iran at the behest of Israel led Tehran to sabotage the Palestinian-Israeli peace process to undermine Washington's efforts, he said. ""If Biden's anti-Iran alliance truly takes hold, it may prompt Iran to go back to its policies of the 1990s when it actively pushed its allies to destabilize parts of the region,"" he  added.     On Thursday, Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid signed a new joint declaration that included a commitment to never allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon and to address Iran's ""destabilizing activities.""    ""There is potential that [Biden's] visit could create further tensions,"" Mohammad Marandi, a professor at the University of Tehran, told CNN.    That prospect hasn't escaped Gulf Arab states, who are wary about getting caught in the line of fire between Iran and the US.   Gargash told CNN that there is a need to de-escalate with Iran. ""We have to find solutions, and we have also to use economic cooperation in various areas,"" he said.  Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a political science professor in the UAE, told CNN that framing a potential military alliance as regional NATO is ""very provocative, and I don't think it is acceptable to whoever is asked to join.""  While there is regional consensus that Iran is now more destabilizing than ever, Israel and the Gulf Arab states differ on how to approach the problem, he told CNN.   ""The mood in Abu Dhabi and in Riyadh is to talk to Iran rather than provoke Iran,"" he said. ""This is where the Gulf, especially Saudi Arabia and the UAE, differ with Israel.""   The claim by the US this week that Iran may be providing drones to Russia may be used by the Biden administration to strengthen the case for a Middle East defense pact against Iran, said Aniseh Bassiri, senior research fellow at the London-based Royal United Services Institute (RUSI).   ""The timing of this information [on Iranian drone sales] is interesting,"" she told CNN's Becky Anderson on Tuesday. ""We know that the US, together with Israel, is trying to shape this defense pact, and I think a lot of the focus of this pact is the capability that the countries have when it comes to drones. Whether there is interest in the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) countries is another question,"" she said.   ""There is plenty of Israeli propaganda that goes into marketing and promoting such a deal,"" said Abdulla. ""Logistically, it is not very easy to do.""  The digest  Majority of Saudi youth see Palestinian cause as a priority, survey finds   Three-quarters of Saudi youth believe addressing the Palestinian-Israeli conflict should be a priority for the Arab world, according to the 13th edition of the Arab Youth Survey. The survey also found that over 90% of Saudi youth, who form nearly two-thirds of the country's population, see the US as an ally.  Background: The findings were announced on Thursday ahead of Biden's trip to Saudi Arabia. The survey comes amid strained US-Saudi ties and an effort by the Biden administration to strengthen relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia.     Why it matters: The survey shows the importance Saudi youth attach to the Palestinian issue as Riyadh moves closer to Israel. It also suggests that despite the tensions between the Biden administration and Saudi Arabia, Saudi youths continue to see the US as an ally.    Netanyahu says Biden agrees a military strike will be necessary if Iran develops nuclear weapons   Israel's former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday suggested that President Biden agrees that a military strike on Iran will be needed if Tehran develops nuclear weapons. ""I told him that without a credible military option, Iran cannot be stopped, and if Iran is not deterred, this military option will need to be carried out. This is my position. I really hope it is also the American position,"" said Netanyahu. ""He [Biden] said he agrees with these words, and I was glad to hear it,"" he added.   Background: Netanyahu's claim comes as he tries to make a comeback as prime minister amid a political deadlock in Israel. During his trip to Jerusalem, Biden renewed his pledge to defend Israel against Iran. In an interview with Israel's Channel 12 News on Wednesday, the President was asked if his commitment to ensure Iran never acquired nuclear weapons meant he would use force against Iran. ""If that was the last resort, yes,"" Biden answered.    Why it matters: Israel has been touting a ""regional air defense alliance"" led by the US, and which would predominantly be aimed at thwarting Iranian drones and missiles. Biden has defended his trip to Middle East, saying regional allies are needed as Iran makes progress in its nuclear program.    White House confirms Biden will meet with MBS without the Saudi king present  The White House on Friday confirmed for the first time that Biden will meet with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman -- known as MBS -- without his father King Salman present while the US President is in Jeddah.   Background: According to Biden's schedule, the Saudi king will only be present for about 30 minutes during the bilateral meetings Friday night. This is the first time the White House has acknowledged it publicly. Biden and the crown prince will continue their meeting after the king departs.   Why it matters: The meeting would be a turnabout from Biden's earlier attempt to shun  MBS. The White House said early in Biden's presidency that the President's interactions with the Saudi leadership would be ""counterpart-to-counterpart.""  What to watch Lina Au Akleh, the niece of slain Palestinian-American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, told CNN's Becky Anderson how her family feels about Biden's regional tour as it continues to grieve.   ""This is where Shireen was born ... and she was killed here,"" Abu Akleh said. ""So it was very important for us to be able to sit with the President himself, to hear our demands.""  Watch the interview here:   Around the region  Some Iranian women are defying their country's state-enforced veil, saying they want to let their hair down and dress freely.   Social media platforms have this week seen a barrage of posts showing Iranian women inside and outside the country taking off their head coverings in public in defiance of the Islamic Republic's strict laws on morality.   Beginning with an activist campaign against Iran's ""National Day of Hijab and Chastity,"" which is observed by the Persian Gulf state every July 12 to promote the veil, the call to do away with the head covering has spread across social media.   More than 120 rights activists signed a statement denouncing Chastity Day, saying that the commemoration is an excuse to ""mark the oppression of Iranian women,"" reported the IranWire news site.    Women in Iran are obliged to cover their hair with a veil, as well as wear loose-fitting garments to hide their body shapes.   Iran's semi-official Fars news agency on Wednesday published photos of women gathering on the streets of Tehran, celebrating Chastity Day in full compliance with the rules.

"Biden says diplomacy is still the best way to keep Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, despite Israeli skepticism",2022-07-14,"President Joe Biden on Thursday said the US will not allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon and that he believed diplomacy remained the best avenue to keep the nation from obtaining one, despite Israeli objections over a deal with the Islamic Republic.  ""This is a vital security interest to both Israel and the United States, and I would add for the rest of the world as well,"" Biden said at a news conference in Jerusalem standing alongside Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid. He added, ""I continue to believe that diplomacy is the best way to achieve this outcome. We will continue to work with Israel to counter other threats from Iran throughout the region, including support for terrorism and ballistic missile program that continues and the proliferation of weapons to terrorist and proxies like Hezbollah."" The President said he would deliver that message to Saudi leadership when he travels to Saudi Arabia on Friday and said, ""With regard to Iran and convincing the Saudis and others that we mean what we say is -- we mean what we say."" Biden has pushed for a revival of the Iran nuclear deal, which former President Donald Trump withdrew the US from in 2018, as he faces increasing pressure from key Middle East allies to produce a plan to contain Iran. Biden's hosts in Israel oppose a new Iran nuclear deal and the previous version of the deal was unpopular in that nation. But hopes appear to be fading that the deal will materialize, and the President on Thursday acknowledged the US is ""not going to wait forever"" for a response from Iranian leadership.  Standing alongside Biden at the news conference, Lapid was dismissive about another nuclear deal as the means to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.  ""Words will not stop them, Mr. President. Diplomacy will not stop them. The only thing that will stop Iran is knowing that if they continue to develop their nuclear program, the free world will use force. The only way to stop them is to put a credible military threat on the table,"" Lapid said.  Biden said in an interview with Israel's Channel 12 News that aired Wednesday that he would use force ""as a last resort"" to keep Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, but did not spell out what that meant. Iran was a main topic of discussion during Biden and Lapid's bilateral meeting on Thursday, and the two leaders signed a new joint declaration on Thursday aimed at expanding the security relationship between their nations and countering what they described as efforts by Iran to destabilize the region. The President reiterated the US' ""ironclad commitment"" to Israel's security.  The President expressed support for the Abraham Accords, one of Trump's legacy achievements that normalized relations between Israel and several Arab countries and pursued an expansion of growing Arab-Israeli security and economic ties. He also emphasized the US' support of expanding Israel's integration into the region -- a major theme of Biden's four-day trip to the Middle East.  Biden also reiterated his support for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict during the news conference.  ""Israel must remain an independent, democratic Jewish state, the ultimate guarantee and guarantor of security of the Jewish people not only in Israel but the entire world. I believe that to my core,"" Biden said.  He continued, ""And the best way to achieve that remains a two-state solution for two people, both of whom have deep and ancient roots in this land living side-by-side in peace and security. Both states fully respecting the equal rights of their citizens, both people enjoying equal measures of freedom and any more that takes us further from that outcome I believe anything is detrimental to the long-term security of Israel."" The US and Israel on Thursday also launched a new high-level strategic dialogue on technology, which officials say is designed to elevate cooperation between the two nations on pandemic preparedness, climate technology, artificial technology and other trusted technology ecosystems.  The President on Thursday also participated in the first virtual leaders meeting of the ""I2U2"" group, which also includes Israel, India, and the United Arab Emirates. The focus of Thursday's meeting was food security as well as advancing clean energy, Biden said ahead of the meeting.  The UAE announced it was investing $2 billion in agricultural parks in India to tackle the food security crisis.  ""This unique grouping of countries aims to harness the vibrancy of our societies and entrepreneurial spirit to tackle some of the greatest challenges confronting our world, with a particular focus on joint investments and new initiatives in water, energy, transportation, space, health, and food security,"" a joint statement from the leaders of India, Israel, United Arab Emirates and the United States reads.  Biden met with President Isaac Herzog of Israel at his residence and was set to discuss Herzog's diplomatic efforts to further integrate Israel into the region, officials said.  Herzog presented Biden with the Israeli Presidential Medal of Honor, and Biden said the award was ""among the greatest honors of my career.""  The President will then meet with former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The two leaders have a relationship that spans nearly four decades that began when Biden was a junior senator. All the same, it has not always been smooth sailing between the two men. Netanyahu made no secret of his disregard for former President Barack Obama -- the feeling, by all accounts, was mutual -- and Biden was badly embarrassed when a visit to Israel as vice president in 2010 coincided with an Israeli government announcement approving plans for new settlement homes. ""They, of course, go back many years and know each other well. And we are clear during this visit that the relationship between the United States and Israel is about the countries, our strategic partnership as two states -- not about individual leaders,"" one official said.  Biden also met with US athletes competing in the Maccabiah Games, an international Jewish and Israeli multi-sport event, and viewed a portion of the opening ceremonies.  This story has been updated with additional developments on Thursday.","{'neg': 0.095, 'neu': 0.648, 'pos': 0.257, 'compound': 0.5775}",38,76.0,0.0925,0.8935,0.014,-0.8126,0.041,0.798,0.16,0.9992,-30.8788,-88.7348,243.0,-0.36516378600823046
Fist bumps instead of handshakes: Biden looks to 'minimize contact' in Israel and Saudi Arabia,2022-07-13,"President Joe Biden was greeted in Israel on Wednesday by a row of Israeli leaders offering open palms to the President.  Biden offered a closed fist in exchange.  The President doled out fist bumps and pats on the shoulder to the delegation stationed along the red carpet at the foot of Air Force One, which the White House said was part of an effort to reduce physical contact amid the rapid spread of a new coronavirus variant.   But only minutes later, Biden broke with the new effort -- exchanging a hearty handshake with the former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the current opposition leader. Biden later also clasped hands with a pair of Holocaust survivors at Yad Vashem. The President's half-hearted effort to reduce physical contact on his trip to the Middle East was a jolting switch for Biden, who has been shaking plenty of hands in the days leading up to his trip. And it raised questions about whether the White House was trying to avoid the optics of Biden shaking hands with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, whom Biden will meet for the first time on Friday.  Biden has been facing questions about that meeting after saying as a candidate he would make Saudi Arabia a ""pariah"" for the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The CIA has alleged that Khashoggi was killed in an operation approved by bin Salman. Pressed by reporters aboard Air Force One, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre denied that was the reason for the attempt at reduced physical contact.  ""We are saying that we're going to try to minimize contact as much as possible. But also, there are precautions that we are taking because this is up to his doctor. BA.4, BA.5 is indeed, as we're seeing, increasing. And we want to make sure that we're taking those precautions to keep him safe and to keep all of us safe,"" Jean-Pierre said, referring to emerging coronavirus variants.  Jean-Pierre said there was not a ""new policy"" around not hand-shaking but said Biden would be taking ""extra precautions.""  ""We're in a phase of the pandemic now where we are seeking to reduce contact and to increase masking, as we're standing here masked before you, to minimize spread,"" the national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Wednesday. ""I can't speak to, you know, every moment and every interaction and every movement. That's just kind of the general principle we're applying here.""  The BA.5 variant became dominant in the US last week, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and epidemiologists have warned of a rise in cases and hospitalizations in the coming weeks.  During a visit to Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust memorial site, Biden also held hands with two Holocaust survivors. Biden went over to talk to 86-year-old Rena Quint and 95-year-old Gita Cycowicz at the conclusion of a wreath-laying ceremony in the Hall of Remembrance. Both women held on to Biden's arm at different points in the exchange, which seemed to go on for longer than officials anticipated. ""Did you see the President hug me?"" Quint said later. ""He asked permission to kiss me, and he kept on holding my hand and we were told not to touch him!"" Biden's attempt to reduce physical contact marked an abrupt shift.  On Monday, Biden shook hands with lawmakers and gun safety advocates at a White House event, and on Tuesday he was seen embracing and shaking hands with members of Congress at the Congressional Picnic.  And last week, Biden shook hands, embraced supporters and took selfies at an event in Cleveland.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",28,77.0,0.129,0.871,0.0,-0.5719,0.059,0.877,0.064,0.4389,-16.013199999999998,-76.929,205.0,-0.37526341463414636
What not to expect from Biden's Jerusalem trip,2022-07-11,"It has taken President Joe Biden, who arrives in Jerusalem this week at the start of a short regional trip to the Middle East, almost eighteen months to schedule a visit to the holy city. After that he will travel to Saudi Arabia.   By contrast, his predecessor Donald Trump made Jerusalem one of his first foreign destinations, visiting four months after taking office.  Biden, though, has sought to remove some of the intensity around the previous administration's embrace of Israel, as well as to recalibrate relations with the Palestinians. Nothing too dramatic, though; the White House has made it clear from the start it has no interest in investing any political capital in re-starting peace negotiations.   The President's visit also comes less than a month after the collapse of the latest Israeli government, a development that will have only reinforced the belief in Washington this is not a time to kick start Israeli-Palestinian diplomacy. Instead, expect attention on Israel's growing regional relationships, and a focus on the Palestinian economy.   New Prime Minister Yair Lapid will be the man welcoming Biden to Israel, but the American visitor is also making time to meet with Benjamin Netanyahu, who opinion polls suggest could be poised for a comeback. Look closely when the President shakes hands with the former Israeli premier, and the shadow of Trump might - ever so slightly - be present in the room.   For more on what to expect from Biden's visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories, CNN spoke to former US Ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro.       How does Biden's Israel policy differ from his predecessors', especially regarding Jerusalem as Israel's undivided capital, the Golan Heights, and settlements?  Biden strongly believes that the only possible solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is an agreement for two states, living in peace and security. He has maintained Trump's move of the US Embassy to Jerusalem, in recognition of Israel's capital. But he has also pledged to reestablish the separate US consulate to conduct diplomacy with the Palestinians that Trump closed, and he is mindful that resolving both sides' claims in Jerusalem can only be done at the negotiating table. With the civil war in Syria grinding on and Iran seeking to threaten Israel with weapons based there, there is no serious possibility of Israeli-Syrian negotiations. So Biden sees nothing on the horizon that raises any question about Israel's control of the Golan Heights, and no reason to delve into the question of sovereignty.     Unlike some of his predecessors, Biden is yet to appoint a special envoy to the Middle East one year into his presidency. What does this say about the importance he attaches to solving the Middle East conflict?  That likely reflects the realistic appraisal that Israeli and Palestinian domestic political dynamics make a breakthrough exceedingly unlikely, as well as the elevation of other priorities, like competing with China, revitalizing NATO, and now, helping Ukraine repel Russia's invasion. In the meantime, the Biden administration supports steps that strengthen the Palestinian economy, reduce friction between Israelis and Palestinians, and limit actions by either side — like settlement expansion and payments to terrorists [through the Palestinian Authority Martyr's Fund] — that can make an eventual solution even harder to achieve.    If the US wants to get something from Israel in regard to a political solution for the Palestinians, what can Biden offer in return?   I don't think Biden is trying to coax a particular action or decision out of Israel on a political horizon. In this phase, when there are no negotiations, it is more about keeping prospects for two states alive for a negotiation that would come later. Even while normalization with Arab states advances, which he fully supports, the Palestinian issue continues to resonate in much of the Arab world and will affect prospects for new countries to join.      Is Israel likely to make any gestures towards the Palestinians ahead of Biden's trip?  Israelis are newly focused on another election, their fifth in less than four years. Even though the new acting prime minister, Yair Lapid, is more moderate on the Palestinian issue than either outgoing Prime Minister Naftali Bennett or his longtime predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli election campaigns are not a time when gestures to the Palestinians are most likely.    Biden is scheduled to meet with Netanyahu, the leader of the opposition. Since Netanyahu is strongly associated with the Trump presidency, how much of a setback would it be for the Biden administration to find Netanyahu installed again as Israel's prime minister, if at all?    There is nothing unusual about a friendly stay-in-touch meeting between a visiting American president and the opposition leader of a democratic ally. With Netanyahu, there could be more policy differences than with Lapid, particularly sharper disagreements around the Palestinian issue and Iran nuclear negotiations. But such differences are not new in US-Israel relations. Biden will be careful not to wade into domestic Israeli politics.    Do you expect Biden to bring up the killing of Shireen Abu Akleh during the visit, or is the case considered closed as far as the US is concerned?  Shireen Abu Akleh's tragic death remains a subject of concern for the US because she was a US citizen and because of the priority placed on journalists being able to do their jobs safely. While the outcome of the US investigation about who was responsible for her killing was inconclusive [but added that Israeli military gunfire was ""likely responsible"" for her death], the Biden administration continues to push for accountability. The subject is not going away, although neither the Israelis nor the Palestinians are likely to be satisfied with the US position.  This interview has been edited for length and clarity.  The digest Family of slain Palestinian-American journalist demand meeting with Biden  The family of slain Palestinian-American reporter Shireen Abu Akleh on Friday sent a strongly worded letter to United States President Joe Biden accusing the US government of ""an apparent effort to undermine our efforts towards justice and accountability,"" and demanding a meeting with the President during his visit to the region this week.   Background: Abu Akleh was shot dead in May while covering an Israeli military operation in the West Bank city of Jenin. Several news organizations, including CNN, as well as the United Nations, published investigations into her death concluding that the bullet that killed her was most likely fired from an Israeli soldier's gun. Earlier this month, the Palestinian Authority handed over the bullet that killed Abu Akleh to the US. It was examined by Israeli experts with US army officials present, according to an Israeli army statement. The US State Department said it ""could not reach a definitive conclusion"" regarding who fired the fatal bullet but that gunfire from Israeli army positions ""was likely responsible."" 
Why it matters: The Abu Akleh family's letter concluded with an appeal to Biden, asking that he ""meet with us during your upcoming visit and hear directly from us about our concerns and demands for justice."" At Friday's White House briefing, spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said she had not read the family's letter and would not be drawn on any possible meeting, but added, ""we hear their concerns, we feel their pain.""    Biden defends decision to visit Saudi Arabia  Biden on Saturday defended his controversial visit to Saudi Arabia later this week, saying the trip is critical to the security of the United States. ""As president, it is my job to keep our country strong and secure,"" Biden wrote Saturday in an op-ed for The Washington Post.  Background: The President's visit has drawn criticism given that US intelligence has deemed Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman responsible for ordering the murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi (bin Salman has denied involvement). As a candidate for president, Biden had pledged to make the kingdom a ""pariah.""  Why it matters: The trip comes as Russia's war in Ukraine has oil prices skyrocketing and global trade disrupted. Biden said he will be focused on a more integrated and stable Middle East, calling the region ""essential to global trade and the supply chains we rely on"" while also noting how critical Middle Eastern energy supplies are in light of sanctions on Russia.  Iran says US-backed regional military alliance will increase tensions A US-backed Israeli-Arab military alliance will only exacerbate regional tensions, the Iranian foreign ministry said on Saturday as US President Joe Biden gears up for a visit to the Middle East.  Background: Israel is working with regional partners on an air defense alliance led by the US, Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz said last month. The air defense systems would defend against rockets, cruise missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles, Gantz said. Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said on Saturday the plan was a ""provocative move"" and that Iran sees it ""as a threat against its national security,"" according to the state news agency IRNA. Kaani added that the US is raising the issue ""with the aim of sowing the seeds of discord and spreading Iranophobia among regional countries,"" added IRNA.   Why it matters: The US has been keen to reassure its Middle East allies of its determination to combat attacks by Iran or its armed proxies in the region. But Middle Eastern nations, particularly Saudi Arabia, have expressed concern over an emboldened Iran if sanctions are lifted after a possible nuclear deal with Tehran.    What's trending Egypt: #Unlimited_internet_in_Egypt  A social media campaign urging Egypt's government and internet providers to offer unlimited internet access on home services has been trending, with many expressing outrage over usage quotas and slow speeds.   Egypt's major internet providers offer limited home-service data bundles at varying speeds with usage caps. Many countries in the region removed data caps for home usage years ago.   ""The internet has now become our life,"" tweeted famed actor and comedian Mohamed Henedy to his 13 million followers. ""Unlimited internet is now a huge necessity for the future.""   The issue was taken up by parliament last week, reported state-backed media, and will be discussed amid nationwide pleas.   Despite the restrictions, the country of about 100 million has high internet penetration.   The World Bank estimates that around 72% of Egypt's population was using the internet as of 2020, when the global pandemic first peaked. That's higher than the internet penetration of Italy and China. Usage in Egypt was up from 57% in 2019.   Earlier this year, communications minister Amr Talaat said ","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",69,78.0,0.0256,0.9279999999999999,0.0464,0.15775000000000003,0.09,0.811,0.099,-0.8063,10.884750000000002,-52.38425000000001,224.0,-0.23385825892857146
Opinion: Biden is heading to the Middle East for one simple reason,2022-07-10,"Presidential visits to the Middle East come in all different shapes and sizes.  Exhausted and ill but enamored of kings, deserts and oil, President Franklin D. Roosevelt met King Ibn Saud, founder of modern Saudi Arabia, on his way home from Yalta in 1945. In 1974, Richard Nixon, the first sitting US president to visit both Israel and the Arab states, took what proved to be a farewell foray two months before he resigned the presidency.  And, in what was surely a president's most consequential Middle East visit, Jimmy Carter gambled on traveling to Egypt and Israel in February 1979 to close a peace treaty signed a month later.    President Joe Biden's brief Middle East visit, which starts on Wednesday, reflects a desire to show that a busy administration -- preoccupied with domestic travails and foreign policy challenges dominated by Russia and China -- still cares about the region.  But the trip's main focus -- improving US relations with Saudi Arabia -- can't obscure the reality that, without the roiled global oil market resulting from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the President might not be traveling to the region at all, and certainly not to a country he once deemed a pariah nation. The President's visit reflects less a strategic shift in administration thinking about a troubled region and more an effort at short term crisis management. Indeed, Biden will find a region filled with problems -- Iran and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict -- he can't resolve and one that is wary of America's own staying power and stability. A stop in Israel before the midterms The idea of a presidential visit to the Middle East began with an April phone call with then-Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett in which Biden accepted an invitation to visit Israel ""in coming months.""  The President had bet heavily on the Bennett government (now defunct with new elections set for November 1) and had given it wide room to maneuver on a few key issues -- such as the reopening of the Jerusalem consulate and Israel's effort to maintain good relations with Russia -- all to prevent the coalition's collapse and the return of former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who's currently on trial and has pleaded not guilty to one charge of bribery and three charges of fraud and breach of trust. Indeed, Netanyahu has always preferred Republicans to Democrats, blatantly intervening in US domestic politics and collaborating with them to oppose US policies, especially on Iran. Biden seemed determined to avoid the tensions between his former boss President Barack Obama and Israel, especially in public. He had said as vice president that there was ""no daylight"" between Israel and the US, especially on security.  Obama had visited Egypt during his first year and failed to stop in Israel. And Biden, whose support for Israel runs deep in his emotional and political DNA, wasn't going to pass up an invitation from an Israeli Prime Minister to visit early in his first term.  The trip would also provide an opportunity to talk about Iran -- Israel's greatest challenge. And as my grandmother used to say about her chicken soup: a presidential visit months before the midterms certainly couldn't hurt the President's politics.  A peace process not ready for prime time Biden has very realistic views about the grim prospects for Israeli-Palestinian peace, telling the UN in September 2021 that a two-state solution is a ""long way away."" But the flare-up of violence in May 2021 between Israel and Hamas and tensions over Jerusalem had drawn the President in and compelled the administration to at least pay more attention to the problem. Biden ought to make it unmistakably clear to both sides to avoid provocative steps that might trigger violence.   Biden will meet with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, whose approval rating among Palestinians is about even with Hamas' and lower than Biden's at home. One can imagine Biden will say all the right things about the importance of a two-state solution, Palestinians rights and how both sides need to avoid steps that might prejudice a final deal. And Abbas will likely press Biden on reopening the consulate in Jerusalem and the PLO office in Washington, in addition to stopping Israeli settlements.  But domestic politics in the US and Israel will constrain Biden's ability and willingness to do much more than offer up modest, confidence-building measures. He ought to make it unmistakably clear to both sides to avoid provocative steps that might trigger violence. And an unpopular Abbas, now in the 17th year of an originally four-year term is too weak to offer up much on his own. In short, serious progress on the Israeli-Palestinian issue just isn't ready for prime time. Crude diplomacy The President has maintained that oil is not the primary reason for his visit to Saudi Arabia. But let's be clear, Biden would not likely be going there now were it not for Russia's invasion of Ukraine and its impact on the global oil market. The President, though, is wise to play down the oil factor largely because the Saudis are likely unwilling or unable to ramp up production enough to have an impact on what Biden cares about most: lowering gas prices that are dragging down his approval ratings before the midterms.  As far as oil is concerned, this trip is an investment in the future, specifically the hope that an improvement in US-Saudi ties will facilitate the Saudis increasing production later this year and into the next.  Biden is clearly conflicted about the trip, having called Saudi Arabia a pariah nation whose leadership has ""little social redeeming value."" Biden keeps insisting that he's not going to meet Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as MBS, one on one and insists that he will only be there as part of a larger meeting. The administration has been working to facilitate an improvement in Israeli-Saudi relations, perhaps in an effort to offset the impact of the meeting with MBS. But the US Ambassador to Israel Thomas Nides opined this week that normalization of relations between the two countries will not happen on this trip. It's doubtful that anything short of a full-throated acceptance of responsibility for Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi's murder would mitigate the intense opposition to MBS from Congress, the media and the human rights community.  Almost four years after Khashoggi's murder and dismemberment, which a US intelligence report found to have happened at the orders of MBS, there's still no accounting or accountability.  Apart from the Khashoggi murder, Saudi Arabia's human rights record reads like a chapter out of an Edgar Allan Poe horror story. MBS has proven himself to be a ruthless authoritarian. To be credible, especially in light of his tough comments about MBS, Biden ought to speak out publicly in Saudi Arabia about the importance he attaches to Saudi Arabia ending its human rights abuses and set expectations that he intends to follow this issue personally. Indeed, whatever the President achieves in Saudi Arabia, the US-Saudi relationship will remain a troubled one. The Middle East is looking past Biden Eighteen months into the Biden administration, there's still much uncertainty in the region about Biden's staying power. Israel and the Gulf states see Washington dealing with other priorities: China, Russia and, of course, the fraught state of America's domestic politics.  America is back, but for how long? The Saudis want security guarantees; Israel desires assurances that the US plans to help them stop Iran from going nuclear and spreading its nefarious influence in the region. America isn't withdrawing from the region and is prepared to strengthen cooperation with Israel and the Gulf states, especially on an integrated air defense system against missiles and drones. But Biden should tread carefully in both Israel and Saudi Arabia and not give binding assurances that could result in an escalatory cycle drawing the US into an unwanted war with Iran. But Biden's real priorities lie elsewhere. At the same time, Israel and the Arab nations read the political map in Washington and see the prospect of Republican gains in the midterms and the very real possibility that Biden, who will turn 80 in November, might be a one-term president. This is particularly true of MBS -- as well as Netanyahu, who has a shot at becoming Israel's next prime minister. The Saudis have been hedging their bets and recently contributed $2 billion to Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner's new investment fund. Given the royal treatment the Saudis received from Trump and Kushner during the last administration, it's no surprise. The Saudis financed the LIVGolf association, which opens this month in the US and has two tournaments scheduled at Trump's properties.  As for Netanyahu, who has always favored Republicans over Democrats and has never been reluctant to show it, nothing would make him happier than to see Trump return as president. Despite some tension, Trump bonded with Netanyahu and delivered an unprecedented array of pro-Israeli moves during his term. With rare exception, the Middle East offers up problems that lack immediate or easy solutions. If Biden is lucky, this will be his only foray into the region during his first term. The President understandably may want to be done with the Middle East. The question, of course, is whether the Middle East is done with him.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",58,79.0,0.0184,0.8512000000000001,0.13040000000000002,0.38605000000000006,0.103,0.772,0.125,0.9824,22.390900000000002,-25.07575,264.0,-0.09498390151515151

Abe was gunned down in broad daylight while delivering a campaign speech in the city of Nara on Friday before he was later pronounced dead in the hospital. His death has shocked and angered Japan, a nation unaccustomed to gun violence. What are the elections for? The electorate will be voting for lawmakers to sit in the upper house of the Diet — Japan's parliament. There are 125 seats up for grabs, according to public broadcaster NHK. The upper house is the less powerful of the two chambers of parliament. Members of the upper house approve legislation, but it can be overridden by the lower house. Members of the 245-seat upper house serve a six-year term, with an election for roughly half the seats every three years. 
What was Abe doing in Nara? At the time of the shooting, Abe was speaking in support of ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) candidates ahead of the election. Despite resigning as Japan's prime minister in 2020 due to health reasons, Abe remained an influential figure in the country's political landscape and continued to campaign for the LDP.
What has Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said? Kishida said he will continue campaigning on Saturday for the elections, adding that a free and fair vote must be defended at all costs.

Abe's body arrived at his residence in the Japanese capital earlier on Saturday, according to CNN staff on the ground.  Abe's widow, Akie Abe, was traveling with his body to Japan's capital, where funeral arrangements will now be discussed, Abe's office told CNN earlier. Dozens of reporters outnumbered uniformed police officers as they waited outside the Abe family's home for his body to arrive.  Police have launched a murder investigation into the assassination of former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe — but little is known about the suspect who was arrested at the scene of the fatal shooting on Friday. Who is the suspect: Tetsuya Yamagami, 41, admitted to shooting Abe, Nara Nishi police said during a news conference on Friday. Yamagami, who is unemployed, told investigators he holds hatred toward a certain group that he thought Abe was linked to. Police have not named the group. What kind of gun was fired: The suspect used a homemade gun in the shooting, police said, and images from the scene showed what appeared to be a weapon with two cylindrical metal barrels wrapped in black tape. Authorities later confiscated several handmade pistol-like items from the suspect's apartment. The weapon was a gun-like item that measured 40 centimeters (about 16 inches) long and 20 centimeters wide, police said. Yamagami made multiple types of guns with iron pipes that were wrapped in adhesive tape, Japan's public broadcaster NHK reported, citing the police. The police found guns with three, five, and six iron pipes as barrels. The suspect inserted bullets in the pipe, which he had bought parts for online, police said, according to NHK. Police believe the suspect used the strongest weapon he made in the assassination, NHK added.  Security probe: Japan's National Police Agency said it will review security arrangements put in place before Friday's shooting, according to NHK. Security was being handled by Nara prefectural police, which drew up a security plan for the former prime minister while he was in the city. The agency said several dozen officers and security personnel from the Tokyo Metropolitan police were on duty and had reportedly watched Abe from all sides during his speech, NHK said. Chinese leader Xi Jinping sent a condolence message to Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida over the killing of former leader Shinzo Abe, state media reported Saturday.  Xi noted that Abe made efforts to promote the improvement of China-Japan relations during his time in office and made positive contributions, CCTV said.  Xi said he was deeply saddened by Abe's death and is willing to work with Kishida to continue to develop China-Japan relations, according to CCTV.  Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan, also sent a message of condolences to Abe's widow, Akie Abe, CCTV said.  Xi met with Abe in Beijing in December 2019, and planed a state visit to Japan in the Spring the following year, but had to cancel the visit because of the coronavirus outbreak. The body of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has arrived in Tokyo, according to CNN staff on the ground.

His death has shocked Japan, a nation with one of the lowest rates of gun crime in the world. Japanese officials will soon begin discussing funeral arrangements for former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who was assassinated in a daylight shooting on Friday, sending a nation unaccustomed to gun violence into a state of shock and anger. On Saturday, the morning after the fatal shooting in a street in central Japan's Nara, a car believed to be carrying the former world leader's body left the Nara Medical University Hospital, where Abe had received treatment, according to Japan's public broadcaster NHK. His widow, Akie Abe, is traveling with her husband's body back to Tokyo, where the family resides, before discussing funeral arrangements, Abe's office told CNN. In the wake of the killing, tearful mourners gathered to place flowers and kneel at a makeshift memorial outside the Yamato-Saidaiji Station in Nara, close to where Abe was assassinated. That a former prime minster could be shot dead at close range while giving a speech in broad daylight in a country with one of the world's lowest rates of gun crime has reverberated around Japan and the world. Presidents, prime ministers and other international leaders sent tributes expressing outrage and sadness over the killing. Abe, 67, was pronounced dead at at 5:03 p.m. local time on Friday, just over five hours after being shot while delivering a campaign speech in front of a small crowd on a street.

Despite resigning as Japan's prime minister in 2020 due to health reasons, Abe remained an influential figure in the country's political landscape and continued to campaign for the LDP. Japan's ""JFK moment"": Abe was Japan's longest-serving prime minister who defined the country's politics for a generation. He will be remembered for boosting defense spending, pushing through the most dramatic shift in Japanese military policy in 70 years, and his grand experiment designed to jolt Japan's economy out of decades of stagnation, known as ""Abenomics."" Tomohiko Taniguchi, a former special adviser to Abe, said the former prime minister was ""one of the most transformative leaders"" of Japan and described his killing as the equivalent to the assassination of US President John F. Kennedy. ""I think it's going to be an equivalent of JFK's assassination day ... It's been a day of sadness, grief, disbelief, and for me, tremendous anger. People are finding it very much hard to digest the reality,"" Taniguchi said on Friday. Read more here. Hundreds of people have gathered in the streets of Tokyo, close to the Abe family home, hoping to catch a glimpse of the car transporting the body of former prime minister Shinzo Abe to the capital.  People of all ages told CNN they felt disbelief at Abe's assassination and were saddened by the former leader's death.  ""It's so sudden that what happened to Abe still hasn’t sunk in for me yet,"" Ryogo Uto, 18,"" said. ""Abe was a respected leader who did many things for Japan while he was in power.""   Another bystander, surnamed Tanimura and who didn’t want to disclose his first name for privacy reasons, told CNN he often saw Abe around the area and wanted to pay his respects.  “I don’t agree with all of Abe’s political stances but he should still be able to express his view without being met with violence,” he said. The Australian city of Melbourne will be ""lit up"" on Saturday night to honor the life of former Japanese leader Shinzo Abe following his assassination. ""Major landmarks in the city will be red and white to remember the life of Japan’s longest serving Prime Minister,"" Dan Andrews, premier of the state of Victoria, of which Melbourne is the capital, wrote on Twitter Saturday.  In a Twitter post on Friday, Andrews said Abe ""served his country with great honour and transformed the geopolitics of our region.""  ""He was a wonderful friend of Australia and my thoughts and prayers are with his wife, his family, and the Japanese people,"" Andrews wrote.  Governments around the world have announced their national flags will fly at half-staff in honor of Abe, who was fatally shot in broad daylight in Nara on Friday.  Governments around the world have announced their national flags will fly at half-staff in honor of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who was fatally shot in broad daylight in Nara on Friday.  United States: President Joe Biden on Friday ordered the nation's flag to be lowered to half-staff, writing in a presidential proclamation that Abe ""was a proud servant of the Japanese people and a faithful friend to the United States.""  “He worked with American Presidents of both parties to deepen the Alliance between our nations and advance a common vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific,” Biden wrote Friday. “Even in the moment he was attacked and killed, he was engaged in the work of democracy, to which he dedicated his life.” India: Flags will be flown at half-staff on ""all buildings where the national flag is flown regularly,"" a statement from the Ministry of Home Affairs said.   Prime Minister Narendra Modi also announced a day of national mourning will be observed Saturday as a mark of India's ""deepest respect"" to Abe.  In a tribute to Japan's former leader, titled ""My friend, Abe San,"" Modi called Abe an ""outstanding leader of Japan"" and ""a towering global statesman.""  Taiwan: Flags will be flown at half-staff on July 11, government spokesperson Chang Tun-han said in a statement Saturday.  Chang said Abe ""had always supported Taiwan greatly.""  ""We believe that Taiwan people have gratitude in their hearts to this,"" the statement said.  Japanese people have been paying tribute to former leader Shinzo Abe near the scene where he was shot on Friday as the country reels from the shock of the former leader's assassination. In the wake of the killing, tearful mourners gathered to place flowers and kneel at a makeshift memorial outside the Yamato-Saidaiji Station in Nara, close to where Abe was assassinated. Dozens of people, some with their children, queued on Saturday with bouquets and prayed at the makeshift memorial. That a former prime minster could be shot dead at close range while giving a speech in broad daylight in a country with one of the world's lowest rates of gun crime has reverberated around Japan and the world. Presidents, prime ministers and other international leaders sent tributes expressing outrage and sadness over the killing.

Despite resigning as Japan's prime minister in 2020 due to health reasons, Abe remained an influential figure in the country's political landscape and continued to campaign for the LDP. ""A free and open Indo-Pacific.""  The term has become the mantra of the United States military and its Indo-Pacific Command, which oversees US forces involved in an area that encompasses 36 nations that are home to more than 50% of the world's population, according to the command. If US warships, warplanes or troops are operating in the region, their presence is almost always announced with a reference to Washington's commitment to ""a free and open Indo-Pacific."" But the term comes not from the halls of the Pentagon but from Shinzo Abe, the former Japanese Prime Minister who was assassinated on Friday. According to Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Abe announced his vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific when giving a speech at a development conference in Kenya in 2016. At the conference, Abe listed ""three pillars"" of the vision: Promotion and establishment of the rule of law, freedom of navigation, free trade, etc.
Pursuit of economic prosperity;
Commitment for peace and stability. In a speech to Japan’s parliament in 2018, Abe said this about the strategy: “A vast expanse of sea stretches from the Pacific Ocean to the Indian Ocean. Since ancient times the people of this region have enjoyed affluence and prosperity from this large and free body of water. Freedom of navigation and the rule of law form their bedrock. We must ensure that these waters are a public good that brings peace and prosperity to all people without discrimination into the future. To this end we will promote the Free and Open Indo-Pacific Strategy.” Dozens of reporters thronged the street outside the home of former Japanese leader Shinzo Abe in Tokyo on Saturday, one day after his assassination shocked the nation.   Members of the press outnumbered uniformed police officers as they waited for Abe's body to arrive in the capital.  Abe's body is due to arrive in Tokyo mid-afternoon Saturday, his office told CNN. Abe's widow, Akie Abe, is traveling with his body to Japan's capital. Funeral arrangements are expected to be discussed upon arrival, according to Abe's office. Abe's shooting in broad daylight has brought Japan's strict firearms laws into focus, in a country with one of the world's lowest rates of gun violence.  Takashi Uchida, 57, who was passing by Abe's home, said he was shocked when he heard of Abe's shooting on Friday.  ""I didn’t expect something like this would happen to someone who was the leader of Japan for such a long time — it’s usually so safe here and we don’t have gun crime,"" he said.  The body of former Japanese leader Shinzo Abe is due to arrive in Tokyo mid-afternoon Saturday, his office told CNN. Abe's widow, Akie Abe, is traveling with his body to Japan's capital, where the family resides. Funeral arrangements are expected to be discussed upon arrival, according to Abe's office. Earlier Saturday, Akie Abe was seen in a car leaving the Nara Medical University Hospital in Nara prefecture where the former Prime Minister was pronounced dead on Friday. Abe died after being shot on the street in Nara as he delivered a campaign speech — a shocking act of violence in a country with one of the world's lowest rates of gun crime. US President Joe Biden called Japan’s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida Friday “to express his outrage, sadness and deep condolences on the tragic and violent shooting death of former Prime Minister Abe Shinzo,” the White House said.  Biden “underscored that he and the American people stand with the Prime Minister and the people of Japan in their time of mourning,” according to a White House statement.  The US President also emphasized the “unwavering confidence in the strength of Japan’s democracy” and he discussed with Kishida how Abe’s legacy “will live on as we continue the important task of defending peace and democracy.” Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe died after being shot on the street in the city of Nara on Friday — a shocking act of violence in a country with one of the world's lowest rates of gun crime. A 41-year-old man was arrested by police, who said he admitted to shooting Abe. The widow of the assassinated former leader was seen in the car leaving the Nara Medical University Hospital in Nara prefecture on Saturday morning. Akie Abe is traveling with her husband’s body back to Tokyo, where the family resides, according to public broadcaster, NHK. Here's what you need to know: The shooting: Abe was shot at about 11:30 a.m. local time Friday in Nara, east of Osaka, as he gave an election campaign speech on the street. Video aired by public broadcaster NHK captured the moments before the shooting, showing Abe speaking to a small crowd in front of Yamatosaidaiji railway station. In subsequent videos, two shots can be heard and smoke can be seen in the air.  Rushed to the hospital: Abe was rushed to hospital via helicopter at 12:20 p.m. local time. He went into cardiopulmonary arrest — a term used to describe the sudden loss of heart function and breathing — at the site of the shooting and arrived at hospital in a state of cardiac arrest, according to doctors at Nara Medical University. During surgery, doctors discovered a gunshot wound to his neck and a large wound on his heart. Confirmed dead: Abe died from excessive bleeding and was pronounced dead at 5:03 p.m. local time, doctors at the Nara Medical University hospital said. The doctors said the bullet that killed the former Japanese leader was ""deep enough to reach his heart"" and a team of 20 medical professionals were unable to stop the bleeding. The suspect: Police arrested unemployed man Tetsuya Yamagami, 41, who admitted to shooting Abe. According to police, Yamagami said he holds hatred toward a certain group, which he thought Abe was linked to. He used a homemade gun in the shooting, and authorities confiscated several handmade pistol-like items from his apartment, police said. Yamagami is being investigated as a suspect in a murder case, to which 90 investigators have been assigned, the police added. World leaders horrified: Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida paid his ""deepest condolences"" to former leader Abe, saying he ""was a personal friend, with whom (he) spent a lot of time."" Kishida said he had a ""great respect for the legacy (Abe) left behind"" and would continue election campaigning on Saturday, adding a free and fair election must be defended at all costs. News of the shooting and Abe's subsequent death horrified leaders around the world, many of whom had worked with Abe during his long tenure. US President Joe Biden said he was ""stunned, outraged, and deeply saddened,"" adding he had worked closely with Abe and his killing was ""a tragedy for Japan and all who knew him."" Shootings are extremely rare in Japan because of strict gun ownership laws: In 2018, Japan, a country of 125 million people, only reported nine deaths from firearms — compared with 39,740 that year in the United States. Under Japan's firearms laws, the only guns permitted for sale are shotguns and air rifles — handguns are outlawed. But getting them is a long and complicated process that requires strenuous effort — and lots of patience. The laws and the thorough process of background checks have kept the number of private gun owners in Japan extremely low. ##Catch Up## Japan's former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe died after being shot during a campaign speech Friday in Nara. He was 67. Abe served two separate terms as the Japanese leader for the right-leaning Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) — the first from 2006 to 2007, then again from 2012 until 2020. His second stint was the longest consecutive term for a Japanese head of government. He came from a family of Japanese prime ministers: Abe was born on Sept. 21, 1954, in Tokyo, to a prominent political family. Both his grandfather and great uncle served as prime minister, and his father was a former secretary general of the LDP. Abe was first elected to Japan's House of Representatives in 1993, at age 38. He held a number of cabinet positions throughout the 2000s, and in 2003 became secretary general of the LDP. Four years later, he was named the party's president and became prime minister of Japan. His first term was marred by controversies and worsening health, and he stepped down as party leader and prime minister in 2007. The end of Abe's first term opened a revolving door in which five different men held the prime minister post in five years until his re-election in 2012. He stepped down in 2020 citing ill health. He continued to be an influential leader after leaving office: After leaving office, Abe remained head of the largest faction of the ruling LDP and remained influential within the party. He has continued to campaign for a stronger security policy and last year angered China by calling for a greater commitment from allies to defend democracy in Taiwan. In response, Beijing summoned Japan's ambassador and accused Abe of openly challenging China's sovereignty. Abe redefined Japan's diplomatic and military policy: Abe will be remembered for boosting defense spending and pushing through the most dramatic shift in Japanese military policy in 70 years. In 2015, his government passed a reinterpretation of Japan's postwar, pacifist constitution, allowing Japanese troops to engage in overseas combat — with conditions — for the first time since World War II. Abe argued the change was needed to respond to a more challenging security environment, a nod to a more assertive China and frequent missile tests in North Korea. During his term, Abe sought to improve relations with Beijing and held a historic phone call with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in 2018. At the same time, he tried to counter Chinese expansion in the region by uniting Pacific allies. He attempted to build a personal relationship with former United States President Donald Trump. As Washington's relationship with Pyongyang tipped toward diplomacy, with both Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in holding historic summits with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Abe said he was ""determined"" to meet Kim. Abe wanted to normalize relations with North Korea and ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula, but his first priority was to bring some closure for the families of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea in the 1970s and 80s. During his tenure, Japan's relations with South Korea soured. The two countries were engaged in a major dispute in which trade and military intelligence deals were scrapped, partly due to the legacy of World War II and Japan's brutal colonization of the Korean Peninsula. ""Abenomics"": Abe came to office during a time of economic turmoil and soon set about rebooting Japan's economy after decades of stagnation. Soon after he was re-elected prime minister in 2012, he launched a grand experiment popularly known as ""Abenomics."" It included three so-called arrows — massive monetary stimulus, increased government spending, and structural reforms. After a strong start, it faltered and in 2015, Abe fired ""three new arrows"" designed to boost gross domestic product. Any hopes they might eventually hit their mark were dashed when Covid-19 swept through the country in 2020, tipping Japan into recession. One of Abe's major domestic achievements was securing the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. But the success of the much anticipated Tokyo Games was ultimately undone by the Covid-19 pandemic, which forced the competition to be postponed to 2021. Abe declared a state of emergency months after the first cases were detected. His administration was also criticized for the low rate of testing, and an early lack of specialist medical equipment to treat the rising number of patients. More successful was Abe's handling of the abdication of Emperor Akihito, the first Japanese monarch to step down in two centuries. He was succeeded by his son, Emperor Naruhito, in October 2019, starting the Reiwa era. Abe is survived by his wife Akie Abe, née Matsuzaki, who he married in 1987. The couple did not have children.

Tributes to Shinzo Abe have poured in from politicians around the world, many of whom recalled their visits with the former leader and expressed their shock at his killing. French President Emmanuel Macron said “Japan has lost a great prime minister."" “On behalf of the French people, I send my condolences to the Japanese authorities and people after the assassination of Shinzo Abe. Japan has lost a great Prime Minister, who dedicated his life to his country and worked to bring balance to the world,” Macron tweeted. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called Abe's assassination ""shocking,"" and praised him as ""a leader with great vision"" and an ""extraordinary partner,"" who took US-Japanese relations ""to new heights."" “It’s profoundly disturbing in and of itself, it’s also such a strong personal loss for so many people,"" Blinken said Friday. A number of former leaders who worked with Abe during his time as Japanese prime minister also offered their condolences. Former British Prime Minister David Cameron said Abe was ""a good friend personally, a strong partner to the UK, and a thoroughly kind and decent man."" He called his death ""devastating and truly shocking."" Israel's ex-leader Benjamin Netanyahu said he ""will always remember Shinzo Abe and cherish our deep friendship,"" while Nicolas Sarkozy, the former French prime minister, called him ""a great leader who left his mark on Japan."" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called Abe's death ""incredibly shocking,"" adding that he was ""deeply saddened."" Trudeau tweeted, ""The world has lost a great man of vision, and Canada has lost a close friend. My thoughts are with his wife, Akie, and the people of Japan as they mourn this loss. You’ll be missed, my friend."" Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro called Abe ""a brilliant leader"" in a tweet Friday. “I receive with extreme indignation and grief the news of the death of @AbeShinzo, a brilliant leader who was a great friend of Brazil. I extend to Abe's family, as well as to our Japanese brothers, my solidarity and my wish that God watch over their souls in this moment of pain,"" he said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky sent his “deepest condolences” to Abe’s family and the people of Japan. “Horrible news of a brutal assassination of former Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe. I am extending my deepest condolences to his family and the people of Japan at this difficult time. This heinous act of violence has no excuse,” Zelensky tweeted. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen said she was “extremely pained” by Abe's passing, referring to the late leader as “the staunchest friend of Taiwan.” Tsai Ing-wen said Abe was “an old friend” she had known “for more than a decade.” UN Secretary General António Guterres tweeted his condolences over Abe's assassination. “I’m deeply saddened by the horrific killing of Shinzo Abe, former Prime Minister of Japan,” Guterres said. “I had the privilege of knowing him for years & will always remember his collegiality & commitment to multilateralism. My condolences to his family, and the people & Government of Japan.” Former US President Barack Obama said he’s “shocked and saddened” by Abe's assassination. In a statement, he recounted the close relationship the two leaders forged during his second term in office and the “extraordinary alliance” between the two nations. In 2016, Obama traveled to Hiroshima with Abe — becoming the first sitting US President to do so — and later that year, Abe returned the gesture, becoming the first Japanese prime minister to visit Pearl Harbor. Former US President George W. Bush, who worked with Abe during his first stint as Japanese prime minister in 2006, said in a statement that he was “deeply saddened to learn of the senseless assassination,"" adding that ""Shinzo Abe was a patriot of his country who wanted to continue serving it."" Queen Elizabeth II, in a message of condolence to the emperor of Japan, said Abe's ""love for Japan, and his desire to forge ever-closer bonds with the United Kingdom, were clear. I wish to convey my deepest sympathy and condolences to his family and to the people of Japan at this difficult time.” Japan reported only one death due to firearms in 2021, according to the National Police Agency. A total of 10 firearm-related incidents were reported in the country in 2021 — up from seven in 2020. Eight of the 10 reported incidents were gang-related, the agency's report states. In the past five years, the highest number of firearm-related deaths per year reported in Japan was four. The data indicates just how rare gun violence is in Japan, which can be credited to its strict gun ownership laws and thorough background check processes. In 2018, Japan, a country of 125 million people, only reported nine deaths from firearms — compared with 39,740 that year in the United States. Under Japan's firearms laws, the only guns permitted for sale are shotguns and air rifles — handguns are outlawed. But getting them is a long and complicated process that requires strenuous effort — and lots of patience. To buy a gun in Japan, potential buyers must: Attend an all-day class
Pass a written test
Pass a shooting-range test with an accuracy of at least 95%
Undergo mental health evaluation and drug tests
Undergo a rigorous background check — including a review of their criminal record, personal debt, involvement in organized crime and relationships with family and friends. After obtaining a gun, the owner must register their weapon with police and provide details of where their gun and ammunition is stored, in separate, locked compartments. The gun must be inspected by the police once a year, and gun owners must retake the class and sit an exam every three years to renew their license. Read more about Japan's gun laws here. Shinzo Abe, who died on Friday after being shot in Nara, served two separate terms as Japanese leader for the right-leaning Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) He first served from 2006 to 2007, then again from 2012 until 2020. His second stint was the longest consecutive term for a Japanese head of government. Worsening China ties: During his term, Abe sought to improve relations with Beijing, while trying to counter Chinese expansion in the region by uniting Pacific allies. After leaving office, Abe remained head of the largest faction of the ruling LDP and maintained influence within the party. Last year, he angered China by calling for a greater commitment from allies to defend democracy in Taiwan. In response, Beijing summoned Japan's ambassador and accused Abe of openly challenging China's sovereignty. Spat with South Korea: Tokyo's ties with Beijing and Seoul also soured during Abe's time in office. Japan and South Korea were engaged in a major dispute in which trade and military intelligence deals were scrapped, partly due to the legacy of World War II and Japan's brutal colonization of the Korean Peninsula. Moving toward the US: Abe was a prominent figure on the world stage, attempting to build a personal relationship with then-US President Donald Trump. He traveled to New York to meet the newly elected Republican President while former President Barack Obama was still in office — Trump's first meeting with any world leader. At home in Japan: Kazuto Suzuki, professor of public policy at Hokkaido University, said Abe “very successfully transformed Japan into a modern state fitting into this globalizing world ... after the subprime crisis,"" adding that the former prime minister helped to recover the country from deflation through “Abenomics.” Suzuki said Abe also tried to change the constitution. Although he was not successful, ""he introduced the legislation on peace and security, which allows the partial implementation of the collective self-defense, which were for the last 70 years was not allowed to have under the interpretation of our constitution,” he said.

"July 8, 2022 Shinzo Abe shot dead in Nara, Japan",2022-07-08,"Our live coverage on the assassination of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has moved here. Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe died after being shot on the street in the city of Nara on Friday — a shocking act of violence in a country with one of the world's lowest rates of gun crime. The shooting suspect was arrested by police, who said he admitted to shooting Abe. Here's what you need to know: The shooting: Abe was shot at about 11:30 a.m. local time in Nara, east of Osaka, as he gave an election campaign speech on the street. He suffered a gunshot wound to the right side of his neck, according to officials in Tokyo. He was taken to the hospital first by ambulance, then by medical helicopter. Rushed to the hospital: Abe arrived at the hospital in a state of cardiac arrest at 12:20 p.m. local time, according to doctors at Nara Medical University. Confirmed dead: Abe was pronounced dead at 5:03 p.m. local time, according to the head of Nara Medical University. At a news conference at the hospital, doctors said the former leader died from excessive bleeding and the bullet that killed him had penetrated deep enough to reach his heart. The suspect: Police arrested shooting suspect Tetsuya Yamagami, 41, who admitted to shooting Abe. According to police, Yamagami said he holds hatred toward a certain group, which he thought Abe was linked to. He used a homemade gun in the shooting, and authorities confiscated several handmade pistol-like items from his apartment, police said. Shootings are extremely rare in Japan because of strict gun ownership laws: In 2018, Japan, a country of 125 million people, only reported nine deaths from firearms — compared with 39,740 that year in the United States. Under Japan's firearms laws, the only guns permitted for sale are shotguns and air rifles — handguns are outlawed. But getting them is a long and complicated process that requires strenuous effort — and lots of patience. The laws and the thorough process of background checks have kept the number of private gun owners in Japan extremely low. ##Catch Up## UN ambassadors observed a moment of silence for the assassinated former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during a session of the Human Rights Council on Friday in Geneva.  The moment of silence was prompted by Japan's Ambassador to Geneva Yamazaki Kazuyuki, who asked other representatives to join him in his tribute to Abe. “I would appreciate if you could join us in observing a moment of silence and silent prayer for Mr. Abe Shinzo,” Kazuyuki said.   A car believed to be carrying the body of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe left the Nara Medical University Hospital in Japan's Nara prefecture before 6 a.m. local time on Saturday, the country's public broadcaster NHK reported.

He was pronounced dead at 5:03 p.m. local time, according to the head of Nara Medical University. At a news conference at the hospital, doctors said the former leader died from excessive bleeding and the bullet that killed him had penetrated deep enough to reach his heart. US President Joe Biden spoke about the assassination of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the beginning of his speech to CIA employees in Virginia on Friday, calling Abe a ""friend” and adding he has “confidence in the strength of Japan’s democracy.”  Biden began his remarks by speaking about the “horrific, shocking killing of my friend Japanese Prime Minister Abe,” and reflected on his personal history with Abe during Biden’s tenure as vice president.  “I became acquainted with him as vice president, I hosted him, he hosted me in Japan,"" Biden said, noting that he stopped by on Friday to see the ambassador and ""sign a condolence book for the Japanese people."" ""I knew him (Abe) well. We worked together closely for years and we spoke and consulted one another when I served as vice president. And he was deeply committed to strengthening the alliance and friendship between the United States and Japan and pursuing an open and free Indo-Pacific region,” Biden said.  Biden praised the former Japanese leader for his commitment and wished the people of Japan well amid a shocking gun violence death in a nation with historically very few instances of gun violence.  “Even after he stepped down from public office to focus on his health, he stayed engaged. He cared deeply and I hold him in great respect. This attack was – has had a profound impact on the psyche of the Japanese people. This is a different, different culture. They're not used to as unfortunately, we are, in the United States, we know how deep the wounds of gun violence go from communities that are affected. And this assassination is a tragedy that all the people in Japan,” Biden said.  Biden said he’s confident Japan’s democracy will withstand the tumult of Abe’s death ahead of its upcoming elections.  “Today, I’m keeping his wife and family my prayers, and the United States is standing in solidarity with our ally, Japan, with confidence in the strength of Japan's democracy as they approach their elections on Sunday,” Biden said. Japan's National Police Agency will review security arrangements for former prime minister Shinzo Abe after he was fatally shot during a campaign speech, the country's public broadcaster, NHK, reported Saturday.  Abe was shot in Nara prefecture in central Japan. He died on Friday from excessive bleeding and was pronounced dead at 5:03 p.m. local time, doctors at the Nara Medical University hospital said during a news conference on Friday.  NHK added that the police agency said the Nara prefectural police drew up a security plan for the former prime minister while in the city. The agency said that the prefecture's police officers and security personnel from the Tokyo Metropolitan police had remained on the lookout and had reportedly watched Abe from all sides during his speech, NHK reported. The police agency did not state how many officers had been deployed to the site. However, it said several dozen, including one specially assigned personnel from the Tokyo police force and the Nara prefecture's plain-clothed police officers were on duty, NHK reported.  Japan's former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe died after being shot during a campaign speech Friday in Nara. He was 67. Abe served two separate terms as the Japanese leader for the right-leaning Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) — the first from 2006 to 2007, then again from 2012 until 2020. His second stint was the longest consecutive term for a Japanese head of government. He came from a family of Japanese prime ministers Abe was born on Sept. 21, 1954, in Tokyo, to a prominent political family. Both his grandfather and great uncle served as prime minister, and his father was a former secretary general of the LDP. Abe was first elected to Japan's House of Representatives in 1993, at age 38. He held a number of cabinet positions throughout the 2000s, and in 2003 became secretary general of the LDP. Four years later, he was named the party's president and became prime minister of Japan. His first term was marred by controversies and worsening health, and he stepped down as party leader and prime minister in 2007. The end of Abe's first term opened a revolving door in which five different men held the prime minister post in five years until his re-election in 2012. He stepped down in 2020 citing ill health. He continued to be an influential leader after leaving office After leaving office, Abe remained head of the largest faction of the ruling LDP and remained influential within the party. He has continued to campaign for a stronger security policy and last year angered China by calling for a greater commitment from allies to defend democracy in Taiwan. In response, Beijing summoned Japan's ambassador and accused Abe of openly challenging China's sovereignty.

US President Joe Biden is ordering flags to be lowered to half-staff until July 10 following the death of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, writing in a presidential proclamation that the late PM “was a proud servant of the Japanese people and a faithful friend to the United States.” “He worked with American Presidents of both parties to deepen the Alliance between our nations and advance a common vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific,” Biden wrote Friday. “Even in the moment he was attacked and killed, he was engaged in the work of democracy, to which he dedicated his life.” Biden also signed a condolence book for Abe at the Japanese ambassador’s residence in Washington, DC. He laid a small wreath of flowers on the table as well.  Japanese Ambassador to the US Koji Tomita greeted Biden for the condolence book signing, according to reporters traveling with the President.  CNN's Aaron Pellish contributed reporting for this post.  Correction: A earlier version of this post incorrectly described where Biden signed a condolence book for Abe. It was at the Japanese ambassador's residence.

He was a very controversial person as well, however, a man of principles, a man of great sense of the common good of his people.""

Read more about Japan's gun laws here and see how the country's laws and gun-related homicide rates compare to other nations in the chart below:  Tomohiko Taniguchi, a special adviser to former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, said Abe was ""one of the most transformative leaders"" of Japan.  ""I think it's going to be an equivalent of JFK's assassination day. ... It's been a day of sadness, grief, disbelief, and for me, tremendous anger. People are finding it very much hard to digest the reality. I think it's very much an isolated event conducted by very much an isolated person. Nonetheless, that isolated incident killed one of the most transformative leaders of the Japanese history,"" he said.  He recalled Abe as a kind man and someone who wanted to usher Japan forward. ""He and Mrs. Abe did not have their own child, and he wanted to bring Japan to the younger generations as a country that is prosperous and future-oriented,"" he said.  ""Once you are befriended with him, you get a lifelong friend,"" he added. Taniguchi was an adviser to Abe from 2013-2014 and wrote foreign policy speeches for the former leader.  ""I would very much like to see his legacy lasting, because there are very few options available for Japan. It's a maritime nation, and it's sitting on the periphery of a huge land mass which is being dominated by three nuclear power nations — Russia, North Korea, China — none of which is democratic. So Japan badly needs alliance partners like the United States, which Shinzo Abe tried very much hard to do,"" he added. The shooting of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has shocked Japan, which has one of the lowest rates of gun crime in the world due to its extremely strict gun ownership laws. The suspect in Friday's shooting used a handmade gun, police said. Gun violence is extremely rare in Japan. In 2018, Japan, a country of 125 million people, only reported nine deaths from firearms — compared with 39,740 that year in the United States. Under Japan's firearms laws, the only guns permitted for sale are shotguns and air rifles — handguns are outlawed. But getting them is a long and complicated process that requires strenuous effort — and lots of patience. To buy a gun in Japan, potential buyers must: Attend an all-day class
Pass a written test
Pass a shooting-range test with an accuracy of at least 95%
Undergo mental health evaluation and drug tests
Undergo a rigorous background check — including a review of their criminal record, personal debt, involvement in organized crime and relationships with family and friends. After obtaining a gun, the owner must register their weapon with police and provide details of where their gun and ammunition is stored, in separate, locked compartments. The gun must be inspected by the police once a year, and gun owners must retake the class and sit an exam every three years to renew their license. The restrictions have kept the number of private gun owners in Japan extremely low.

According to Nara-nishi police, Yamagami Tetsuya, a 41-year-old unemployed man, said he holds hatred toward a certain group, which he thought Abe was linked to. ##Investigation## US President Joe Biden said he was “stunned, outraged, and deeply saddened"" by the death of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Friday. “Above all, [Abe] cared deeply about the Japanese people and dedicated his life to their service. Even at the moment he was attacked, he was engaged in the work of democracy,” Biden wrote in a statement. “While there are many details that we do not yet know, we know that violent attacks are never acceptable and that gun violence always leaves a deep scar on the communities that are affected by it. The United States stands with Japan in this moment of grief. I send my deepest condolences to his family.”  Abe maintained a close relationship with the United States during his time as prime minister, traveling with then-President Barack Obama to Pearl Harbor in 2016 and, later that year, becoming the first world leader to meet with then-president elect Donald Trump in New York, just two weeks after his election. As vice president, Biden met with Abe both in Tokyo and Washington.  Earlier Friday, a White House spokesperson told CNN’s Jeremy Diamond that the White House was “shocked and saddened” by Abe’s shooting. Biden told reporters Friday that he’s reached out to Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida following the assassination of the former prime minister, adding that he planned to stop by the Japanese embassy to sign a condolence book later on in the day.  He said that right now, he does not believe Abe's death will “have any profound destabilizing impact on Japanese security or Japanese solidarity,"" adding that Japan is a ""very, very stable ally.""   The President noted, “this is the first use of a weapon to murder someone in Japan,” to date this year, while the US has had ""between 3 and 4,000 cases."" He said as investigations continue, the FBI will give the President more details. The shooting of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is being investigated as a murder case, Nara-nishi police said Friday. According to police, shooting suspect Yamagami Tetsuya, a 41-year-old unemployed man, said he holds hatred towards a certain group, which he thought Abe was linked to. Ninety investigators are dedicated to the case, police said. Police searched the suspect’s apartment at 5:17 p.m. local time, police said, adding that several handmade pistol-like items were confiscated during the raid. ##Investigation## In early 2013, Japan's late former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe launched a grand experiment designed to jolt Japan’s economy out of decades of stagnation. Known as “Abenomics,” it included three so-called arrows: massive monetary stimulus, increased government spending and significant economic reforms. ""Abenomics was, in very simple terms, a throw-it-all, buy-it-all strategy to try and stimulate growth. So, put massive spending into the economy, buy up government bonds, also implement economic reforms,"" CNN's Anna Stewart explained. ""It was a way of trying to get mass employment, make people wealthier so they could spend more money, and just try and get the economy ticking."" ""During his premiership, you saw the Bank of Japan push interest rates into negative territory,"" she said, adding that such a move was extremely unconventional at the time combined with ""huge quantitative easing."" Since then, such a move has become much more conventional, particularly in recent years since the pandemic with all sorts of central banks around the world — the US Federal reserve, the ECB, the Bank of England — all doing similar moves, she added. Abenomics was successful as well — at least for the first few years, according to experts, Stewart noted. ""Critics would say that not all three arrows were ever fully achieved, and as a result of that, the success was unfortunately, limited."" ""The problem for Japan was how to end what was very loose monetary policy, and also some of the structural issues, particularly with an aging workforce,"" Stewart added. However, the policy also led to record-high government debt and failed to make a lasting dent in decades of deflation, CNN's Will Ripley reported. Police in Nara, Japan, will hold a news conference on the assassination of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Abe died on Friday after being shot while giving a campaign speech on a street in central Japan, according to public broadcaster NHK. Abe died from excessive bleeding and was pronounced dead at 5:03 p.m. local time, doctors at the Nara Medical University hospital said during a news conference on Friday. The doctors said the bullet that killed the former Japanese leader was ""deep enough to reach his heart"" and a team of 20 medical professionals were unable to stop the bleeding. Abe went into cardiopulmonary arrest at the site of the shooting and was rushed to hospital in a state of cardiac arrest at 12:20 p.m. local time, doctors said. During surgery, doctors discovered a bullet wound to his neck and a large wound on his heart. Abe, 67, was the former Liberal Democratic Party leader and Japan's longest-serving prime minister, holding office from 2006 to 2007 and again from 2012 to 2020, before resigning due to health reasons. Since stepping down, he remained in the public eye and regularly appeared in the media to discuss current affairs. CNN's Helen Regan and Junko Ogura contributed reporting to this post. The assassination of Shinzo Abe took place in broad daylight on a street in the Japanese city of Nara, a regional capital just east of Osaka. Abe was delivering a speech in support of Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) candidates ahead of the upcoming Upper House elections scheduled for Sunday. He had planned to head to Kyoto next, then to Saitama prefecture neighboring the capital Tokyo. Video aired by the public broadcaster captured the moments before the shooting, showing the former prime minister speaking to a small crowd in front of Yamatosaidaiji railway station. In subsequent videos, two shots can be heard and smoke can be seen in the air. Kazuto Suzuki, professor of public policy at Hokkaido University, told CNN’s Max Foster that Shinzo Abe “left a lot of legacies in Japan and the world.” He “very successfully transformed Japan into a modern state fitting into this globalizing world ... after the subprime crisis,” Suzuki said, adding that the former prime minister helped to recover the country from deflation through “Abenomics.” “He also tried to change the constitution -- although he was not successful -- but he introduced the legislation on peace and security, which allows the partial implementation of the collective self-defense, which were for the last 70 years was was not allowed to have under the interpretation of our constitution,” he added.  One of Abe's biggest legacies, Suzuki said, “is the concept of Indo-Pacific.” He was “trying to bring the United States, Australia and India [into] the effort of counterbalancing [and] counter-measuring with [the] emergence of China in East Asia,"" Suzuki said.  Michelle Lee, The Washington Post’s Tokyo bureau chief, told CNN that the best way to describe Abe is as “a towering political figure both at home and abroad.” He is “probably the most recognizable Japanese politician outside of Japan. And even within Japan, even though he resigned in 2020 as prime minister,” she added.  “He was the youngest prime minister to be elected. He was the longest serving prime minister. He said so many things and created some controversies and scandals, but he was incredibly influential,” Lee said. Read more on Abe here.

Kishida said he will continue campaigning tomorrow, ahead of Upper House elections scheduled for Sunday, adding that a free and fair vote must be defended at all costs. Abe had been delivering a campaign speech, supporting candidates from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, when he was shot in Nara on Friday. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol expressed his shock and sorrow for the death of Shinzo Abe in a statement released by the presidential office late Friday afternoon. ""I extend my condolences to the bereaved family and the Japanese people who have lost the longest-serving Prime Minister and a respected politician in the history of Japan's constitution,"" President Yoon said, according to the statement. ""The shooting that killed Prime Minister Abe is an unacceptable criminal act.""

""His global leadership through unchartered times will be remembered by many,"" wrote British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in a tweet. ""My thoughts are with his family, friends and the Japanese people. The UK stands with you at this dark and sad time."" London Mayor Sadiq Khan also tweeted his condolences, calling the shooting ""an attack on democracy"" and ""a shameful act of cowardice to silence a political leader.""

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Abe had been a ""great friend and ally to Australia,"" and told the people of Japan, ""We mourn with you."" European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called Abe ""a wonderful person,"" adding: ""This brutal and cowardly murder of Shinzo Abe shocks the whole world."" Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was born on September 21, 1954, in Tokyo, to a prominent political family. Both his grandfather and great uncle served as prime minister, and his father was a former secretary general of the right-leaning Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). He studied politics at Tokyo's Seiki University and the University of Southern California, but initially entered business, taking a position with Kobe Steel in 1979. Three years later, he became an assistant to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Abe was first elected to Japan's House of Representatives in 1993, at age 38. He held a number of cabinet positions throughout the 2000s, and in 2003 became secretary general of the LDP. Four years later, he was named the party's president and became prime minister of Japan. His first term was marred by controversies and worsening health, and he stepped down as party leader and prime minister in 2007. The end of Abe's first term opened a revolving door in which five different men held the prime minister post in five years until his re-election in 2012. He stepped down in 2020 citing ill health. Abe died on Friday age 67 after being shot in Nara. Read more about Abe's life and career. Shinzo Abe, who died on Friday after being shot in Nara, served two separate terms as Japanese leader for the right-leaning Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)  He first served from 2006 to 2007, then again from 2012 until 2020. His second stint was the longest consecutive term for a Japanese head of government. Worsening China ties: During his term, Abe sought to improve relations with Beijing, while trying to counter Chinese expansion in the region by uniting Pacific allies. After leaving office, Abe remained head of the largest faction of the ruling LDP and maintained influence within the party. Last year, he angered China by calling for a greater commitment from allies to defend democracy in Taiwan. In response, Beijing summoned Japan's ambassador and accused Abe of openly challenging China's sovereignty. Spat with South Korea: Tokyo's ties with Beijing and Seoul also soured during Abe's time in office. Japan and South Korea were engaged in a major dispute in which trade and military intelligence deals were scrapped, partly due to the legacy of World War II and Japan's brutal colonization of the Korean Peninsula. Moving toward the US: Abe was a prominent figure on the world stage, attempting to build a personal relationship with then-US President Donald Trump. He traveled to New York to meet the newly elected Republican President while former President Barack Obama was still in office — Trump's first meeting with any world leader. Read Abe's obituary here. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg sent his “deepest condolences” to the family of assassinated former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and the people of Japan in a tweet on Friday. “Deeply saddened by the heinous killing of Shinzo Abe, a defender of democracy and my friend & colleague over many years,” Stoltenberg wrote.

At first, a team of 10 professionals were treating him, but the number doubled, doctors said in a news conference Friday.  Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has died after being shot on the street in the city of Nara on Friday — a shocking act of violence in a country with one of the world's lowest rates of gun crime.  Here's what we know now: The shooting: Abe was shot at about 11:30 a.m. local time in Nara, east of Osaka, as he gave an election campaign speech on the street. He suffered a gunshot wound to the right side of his neck, according to officials in Tokyo. He was taken to the hospital first by ambulance, then by medical helicopter.
Rushed to hospital: Abe arrived at the hospital in a state of cardiac arrest at 12:20 local time, according to doctors at Nara Medical University. In a news conference several hours after the shooting, an emotional Prime Minister Fumio Kishida confirmed that Abe was in critical condition, undergoing emergency treatment. Abe's brother, also the country's Defense Minister, said he was receiving a blood transfusion.
Confirmed dead: Abe was pronounced dead at 5:03 p.m. local time, according to the head of Nara Medical University. At a news conference at the hospital, doctors said the former leader died from excessive bleeding and the bullet that killed him had penetrated deep enough to reach his heart.
The suspect: Police have arrested Tetsuya Yamagami, a Nara resident in his 40s, in relation to the shooting, according to NHK, citing police sources. NHK reported that the man did not try to run away, and is being held for questioning at Nara Nishi police station. He appears to have used a handmade gun, NHK reported. Video footage of the incident shows security personnel wrestling him to the ground close to where Abe had been standing, moments after shots were heard.
International outcry: Messages from world leaders, past and present, have flooded in, expressing condemnation for the shooting. These include European figures such as the leaders of France, the United Kingdom and Italy; Asia-Pacific leaders from China, India, Singapore, Taiwan, New Zealand and Australia; and other leaders of international organizations. ##Catch Up## Former Japanese leader Shinzo Abe had no vital signs when he reached the hospital, doctors at Nara Medical University said Friday.

""We are following the developments, and we hope former Prime Minister Abe will be out of danger and recover soon.

Zhao declined to comment on Chinese social media reactions to the shooting, saying: ""I have just fully expressed the Chinese government’s position that this unexpected incident should not be associated with Sino-Japanese relations."" Some context: Chinese social media was flooded with gleeful comments following the shooting, with ultra-nationalist users gloating over the attack. Relations between China and Japan deteriorated during Abe's time in office, worsened by a slow-burning dispute over sovereignty of disputed Japanese-administered islands known as the Senkaku Islands in Japan and the Diaoyus in China. Many Chinese users also criticized Abe for visiting the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, regarded in China as a symbol of Japan's imperial military past. The online schadenfreude was so unseemly that even some of the country's most prominent nationalist influencers felt compelled to speak out. Hu Xijin, former editor-in-chief of the state-run nationalist tabloid the Global Times, expressed sympathy for Abe. ""I think at this moment we need to put aside our political disputes with him,"" he wrote on China's Twitter-like Weibo. 
""Some people may say that I am 'pretending to be compassionate,' but as a veteran Chinese journalist, this is my firm public attitude in the field of public opinion. And I hope that more people will understand and join me in holding this attitude."" Jin Canrong, an international relations scholar known for his hawkish views, also weighed in. “I advise everyone to have some respect for life, to be patriotic and speak up in a rational way,"" he wrote on Weibo. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Friday she was ""stunned by the news of the tragedy that occurred today in Japan."" “We are convinced that those who planned and committed this monstrous crime will bear the due measure of responsibility for this act of terrorism, which has no justification and cannot be justified,” she added.  She praised Shinzo Abe as “an outstanding political figure who has made an invaluable contribution to the development of Russian-Japanese relations in all areas on the path of building mutual trust and good neighborliness,"" adding that she hoped his condition would stabilize soon. Shock and prayers from leaders around the world continue to flow in, as former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe remains in the hospital after being shot on Friday. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg tweeted that his thoughts were with Abe and his family, saying he was ""deeply shocked by the heinous shooting."" French President Emmanuel Macron also tweeted that he was ""deeply shocked."" ""Thoughts to the family and loved ones of a great Prime Minister. France stands alongside the Japanese people,"" Macron said.  International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach condemned the shooting as a ""cowardly attack,"" adding: ""I hope and pray that he will recover."" Other European leaders, including Luxembourg's Prime Minister Xavier Bettel, Romanian President Klaus Iohannis, and Ireland's leader Micheál Martin shared similar messages online.  Meanwhile in Asia, Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong decried the shooting as ""a senseless act of violence,"" saying he had recently hosted Abe for a lunch in May during a visit to Tokyo. The wife of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has arrived at Nara Medical University, where he is being treated, according to Japan's public broadcaster NHK. Abe's younger brother, Nobuo Kishi, also the country's Defense Minister, confirmed earlier that Abe is receiving a blood transfusion.

Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is receiving a blood transfusion, according to Nobuo Kishi, Abe's younger brother and the country's Defense Minister. ""I am told that he is now in a hospital in Nara, where he is receiving sensible treatment, including a blood transfusion,"" Kishi said. Abe suffered a wound to the neck when he was shot on Friday morning in the city of Nara, according to officials. Kishi said the attack, which took place as Abe was delivering an election campaign speech, is “an affront to democracy” and suppression of “freedom of speech."" Former Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said in a statement Friday that the shooting of Shinzo Abe ""cannot be forgiven."" ""First and foremost, I pray for the recovery of former Prime Minister Abe,"" said Suga, who served from 2020 to 2021, in between Abe's resignation and the election of current Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. He added that the shooting was an act of ""barbarity ... that denies the basis of democracy, which is the election campaign, and cannot be forgiven by any means."" Some context: Abe had been in the city of Nara delivering a speech in support of Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) candidates, ahead of upcoming Upper House elections, when the shooting happened. Even after resigning as Japan's Prime Minister in 2020, citing health reasons, Shinzo Abe has remained politically active.  He has regularly appeared in the media to discuss current affairs; for instance, he told Japanese television in February that Japan should discuss a possible sharing of nuclear weapons similar to that of NATO members following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. On Friday before the shooting, he had been in Nara giving an election campaign speech on the street, to support Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) candidates ahead of Upper House elections scheduled for Sunday. He had planned to head to Kyoto next, then to Saitama prefecture neighboring the capital Tokyo. History maker: Abe is the longest-serving Prime Minister in Japan's history, having served from 2006 to 2007, then again from 2012 to 2020, when he stepped down, citing his chronic illness colitis.
Economic legacy: By the time he was re-elected in 2012, Japan was facing an economic downturn after decades of stagnation — prompting one of Abe's landmark initiatives, an experiment known as ""Abenomics."" His allies credit the move with halting further decline — but the country's economy remained vulnerable throughout his time in office.
""Womenomics"": Abe also touted workplace reforms during his tenure, vowing to improve gender representation and closing gaps in the workforce — increasingly urgent as Japan faced a demographic decline, with a rapidly ageing population and falling birth rate. But critics say Abe did not manage to address the country's gender gap or resolve deep-rooted issues.
International relations: On the diplomatic front, too, Abe's achievements were mixed. He cultivated a strong relationship with Washington — Tokyo's major post-war ally — and personal ties with then-President Donald Trump. But Japan's relationships with China and South Korea deteriorated during his time in office, with a number of territorial disputes and diplomatic spats. World leaders are continuing to express their well wishes as former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe undergoes emergency treatment in the hospital after he was shot on Friday. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with your family and the people of Japan,"" wrote Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, on Twitter. Finland's President Sauli Niinistö also tweeted that he was ""deeply shocked"" by the ""violent attack,"" extending his thoughts to Abe's family and the Japanese nation. Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said he was shocked by the ""sad news,"" adding: ""We send our prayers & best wishes for his early recovery & good health."" The President of the European Council, Charles Michel, called the shooting a ""cowardly attack,"" praising Abe as ""a true friend, fierce defender of multilateral order & democratic values.""  New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said she was ""deeply shocked"" to hear about the shooting of former Japanese leader Shinzo Abe on Friday.  ""He was one of the first leaders I met when I became PM. He was deeply committed to his role but also generous & kind,"" Ardern wrote on Twitter.

“What this will do to the national psyche of a people who move about freely and have a social contract with each other, that they will not resort to this type of violence … I am devastated thinking about that.” Snow said Japan has been an “oasis” and had “shown what it can teach the US about guns.”    “I think (Friday’s shooting) will change Japan, unfortunately forever,” she said. The shooting of Shinzo Abe has shocked Japan, which has one of the lowest rates of gun crime in the world due to its extremely strict gun control laws.  In 2018, Japan only reported nine deaths from firearms, compared with 39,740 that year in the United States. Under Japan's firearms laws, the only guns permitted for sale are shotguns and air rifles — handguns are outlawed. But getting them is a long and complicated process that requires strenuous effort — and lots of patience. To buy a gun in Japan, potential buyers must attend an all-day class, pass a written test and a shooting-range test with an accuracy of at least 95%. They also must undergo mental health evaluation and drug tests, as well as a rigorous background check —  including a review of their criminal record, personal debt, involvement in organized crime and relationships with family and friends. In 2019, only an estimated 310,400 guns were held by civilians in Japan, in a country of 125 million people. In 2007, the mayor of Nagasaki in southern Japan, Iccho Ito, died after being shot at least twice in the back by an alleged gangster. Since then, Japan has furthered tightened its gun control law, imposing heavier punishments for gun crimes committed by members of organized crime gangs. Watch more on this here.  Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno has confirmed that former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was shot at around 11:30 a.m. in Nara. His condition is not known, and ""we are checking the situation,"" Matsuno told reporters at an emergency news briefing at the Prime Minister's office. Matsuno added that Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who was on a tour of official engagements, was immediately informed. Kishida will return to his office urgently, and is scheduled to speak later today. Ministers in various parts of the country have been instructed to return to Tokyo immediately, said Matsuno. Relevant ministries and agencies have held a meeting to deal with the situation.  “Such barbaric behavior is unacceptable for any reason and we firmly condemn it. The government will take all possible measures to deal with the situation,” said Matsuno. Video footage aired by Japan's public broadcaster NHK captures the moments leading up to and after Abe's collapse. The former Prime Minister was on the street speaking to a small crowd, delivering a campaign speech, when a loud bang is heard. The camera shakes, with shouts heard. Moments later, police can be seen wrestling a man to the ground. Another video aired by NHK shows smoke in the air in the moments surrounding Abe's collapse. Police have arrested a man on suspicion of attempted murder and retrieved a gun, according to NHK. Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was conscious and responsive while being transported to the hospital after the possible shooting, according to Japan's public broadcaster NHK, citing police sources. An aerial photo from Nara city on Friday shows Abe being taken to the hospital via helicopter. Abe is seen lying on a stretcher, surrounded by several people. The former Prime Minister was in Nara on Friday giving a speech in support of Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) candidates, ahead of Upper House elections scheduled for Sunday, when the apparent shooting occurred. Photos taken before Abe collapsed show him speaking on the street, with onlookers and passersby clearly visible around him. An official from the Nara City Fire Department has confirmed to CNN that former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was in a state of cardiopulmonary arrest when he collapsed while giving a campaign speech in Nara. Abe was rushed to hospital on Friday after he was shot in the chest during a speech public broadcaster NHK reported, citing an official of the Liberal Democratic Party Abe faction.  His condition is unknown, Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said, according to Reuters. United States Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel posted on Twitter Friday that he was ""saddened and shocked"" following the possible shooting of Shinzo Abe. ""Abe-san has been an outstanding leader of Japan and unwavering ally of the U.S. The U.S. Government and American people are praying for the well-being of Abe-san, his family, & people of Japan,"" it added. Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said the condition of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is unknown, according to Reuters. Abe was rushed to hospital after being apparently shot in the chest, according to public broadcaster NHK.  An aerial photo showed emergency vehicles at the scene in the city of Nara, and a small crowd gathered on the sidewalk. Video broadcast on NHK showed police wrestling a man to the ground on the street, close to where Abe was delivering an election campaign speech. Former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull tweeted on Friday that he was ""horrified"" by the news of Abe's collapse. ""Abe Shinzo is one of the great leaders of our times. Right now we must hope and pray that he pulls through,"" Turnbull wrote. Turnbull served as Prime Minister from 2015 to 2018, while Abe was Prime Minister of Japan. Photos posted on social media Friday show a suspect being held down on the ground, his arms restrained. Police have arrested a man on suspicion of attempted murder and retrieved a gun, according to Japanese public broadcaster NHK. Shinzo Abe collapsed during a speech in Nara City at around 11:30 a.m. local time, and appeared to be bleeding after a possible gunshot in his back, according to Japan’s public broadcaster NHK. According to an official of the Liberal Democratic Party Abe faction, Abe was shot in the chest and carried away by an ambulance, NHK reported. Police have arrested a man on suspicion of attempted murder and retrieved a gun. Abe arrived in Nara from Haneda Airport via Osaka Airport to give an election campaign speech on the street, to support Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) candidates ahead of the upcoming Upper House elections scheduled for Sunday, according to NHK.  He had planned to head to Kyoto afterward, then to Saitama prefecture, which neighbors the capital Tokyo. NHK TV is reporting that Abe is moved to Nara Medical University. CNN has not been able to independently verify these reports.  An official from the Nara City Fire Department official said a man collapsed while giving a speech today, and that man has been transported by ambulance to hospital — but the official said he cannot disclose the man's identity or medical status. Shinzo Abe was the longest-serving Japanese Prime Minister in history before he stepped down in 2020, citing health reasons.  Abe has colitis, a non-curable inflammatory bowel disease, which was also a factor in his sudden resignation as prime minister in 2007, ending his first term after just over a year in office. ""For almost eight years I controlled my chronic disease, however, this year in June I had a regular check-up and there was a sign of the disease,"" he said in August 2020, when announcing his resignation.  Serving multiple terms: Abe's first term was marred by controversies and worsening health, and he stepped down as party leader and prime minister in 2007, eventually returning to both positions in 2012. Following his return as leader, he became the dominant force in Japanese politics, winning a landslide third term in 2017 and a fourth in 2019. An aerial photo shows emergency vehicles at the scene in Nara, and a small crowd gathered on the sidewalk. Shinzo Abe, the former Japanese Prime Minister, had been in the city for a speech on Friday. Shinzo Abe, the former Prime Minister of Japan, was rushed to the hospital on Friday afternoon after a possible shooting during a speech in the city of Nara, according to public broadcaster NHK. Nara is located just east of Osaka.

Israeli and Palestinian leaders speak by phone for the first time in years,2022-07-08,"Israel's new Prime Minister Yair Lapid and the Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas held a phone conversation Friday morning, which is believed to be the first such contact between Israeli and Palestinian leaders for five years.  A short statement from Lapid's office said the two men ""spoke about the continuation of cooperation and the need to ensure quiet and calm.""  Abbas had congratulated Lapid on becoming Prime Minister, the statement said, while Lapid passed along his best wishes to the Palestinian leader ahead of Eid al-Adha, the Muslim holiday which begins Friday.  The Palestinian news agency Wafa also reported the phone conversation, adding that President Abbas had expressed his wish that ""peace and stability would prevail in the region as soon as possible.""    Lapid's predecessor, right-winger Naftali Bennett, chose not to speak with Abbas during his 12-month premiership, while long-time leader Benjamin Netanyahu oversaw a degradation of Israel's relations with the Palestinian Authority, and it is reported he last spoke to the Palestinian leader in 2017.  Underscoring the current Israeli government's changed approach, Defense Minister Benny Gantz visited Abbas at his Ramallah office Thursday evening.   During the meeting, the Palestinian leader ""stressed the importance of creating a political horizon [and] commitment to the signed agreements,"" Wafa reported, referring to a series of accords signed between the two sides in the 1990s.   A statement from Gantz's office said the meeting had discussed ""security and civilian coordination ahead of the visit of US President Biden to Israel.""  As well as Israel, Biden is also set to visit the West Bank next week where he will meet with Abbas -- in the first meeting between the Palestinian leader and a US President since 2017. The White House hopes the meeting will help draw a line under the significant breakdown in US-Palestinian relations seen under the Trump administration.  In a separate development earlier this week, Abbas travelled to Algeria where he met with Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, also for the first time in several years.  The meeting was held on the sidelines of celebrations to mark the 60th anniversary of Algeria's independence, Algeria's state news agency reported. Relations between Abbas's Fatah party, the largest Palestinian faction, and Hamas, the Islamist group that runs Gaza, have been strained for many years. In June 2007, the two groups were in open conflict with each other, in violence that saw the end of Palestinian Authority control in Gaza.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",12,83.0,0.053,0.903,0.044,-0.3818,0.035,0.861,0.104,0.9705,-4.5816,611.9404999999999,836.0,0.7319862440191387
A leader for all Israelis? Yair Lapid takes over as caretaker prime minister,2022-07-01,"Yair Lapid is used to being in the spotlight.  The son of a prominent family, Lapid has dabbled in acting, screenwriting, music and even amateur boxing, before becoming best known to the Israeli public as a journalist-turned-politician.  Now Lapid will be entering his biggest spotlight yet -- as Israel's caretaker prime minister.   Lapid officially took over as caretaker prime minister on Friday after the country's parliament, the Knesset, passed a bill to dissolve itself a day earlier.  He's now preparing for elections, trying to keep former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from climbing back to power.  A media celebrity  Despite his brief acting foray, Lapid became a mainstay in Israelis' living rooms through the news. After briefly working as a print journalist, he made his way on to television in the mid-1990s, hosting one of the biggest talk shows of the era.  But in 2012 Lapid changed course following in the footsteps of his journalist-turned politician father. He created a new political party, dubbed ""Yesh Atid"" (There is a Future) and positioned himself as the centrist voice of the middle-class Israeli, focusing on domestic issues. He promised to tackle housing costs, end exemptions from the military draft for the Ultra-Orthodox, and to legalize same-sex marriage.  ""What unites all of (our supporters) is that they said yes for hope and yes for mutual responsibility and yes to the fact that the truth is not being held in any side,"" Lapid said at the time.  A centrist for all  In his first campaign, Lapid tried to portray his party as one all Israelis could be part of, even unveiling his diplomatic platform from a settlement in the occupied West Bank. He supports an independent Palestinian state, but says East Jerusalem shouldn't be its capital. He opposes new settlement construction but says large existing settlement blocs should always be a part of Israel.  ""Yair Lapid is the quintessential product of Tel Aviv, of Israel's main secular city, its main business and culture center, center of nightlife and so on,"" Anshel Pfeffer, a correspondent for Haaretz and The Economist, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour.  ""Many Israelis, including Israelis who were close to his centrist perhaps leaning leftward politics and views, including many of my colleagues in Israeli media, didn't take him seriously. They thought he's a performer, he's a presenter, there's no real substance there, this will be a passing phase.""  But Lapid's party shocked the Israeli political establishment by winning 19 seats in the 2013 elections, second only to Netanyahu's Likud party. Lapid was dubbed Israel's new political star, and Time Magazine named him as one of 2013's ""100 Most Influential People.""  He joined then-Prime Minister Netanyahu's government as finance minister but was fired within less than two years and became one of the opposition's top voices.  The most diverse coalition  In 2021 after four inconclusive elections in two years, it was Lapid who was the architect of the coalition that would ultimately oust Netanyahu and end his run as Israel's longest-serving prime minister.  Pulling together parties from across the political spectrum, from the far left to those on the right, and even including the first Arab party in to sit in a governing coalition -- the new government held a one-seat majority.  But it came at a cost to Lapid's own political ambitions. As part of the deal to bring the right-winger Naftali Bennett on board as prime minister, Lapid would only take over after two years.  ""Lapid brought together this very unwieldy, almost unimaginable, unprecedented coalition of eight parties (and) managed to get them all to vote for Naftali Bennett as prime minister, managed to maintain them for an entire year, and above all for many Israelis he is now the only man in the last 12 years to beat Netanyahu -- that by itself is a big achievement,"" Pfeffer said.  Lapid was appointed foreign minister, where he traversed the globe meeting with world leaders and, notably, Israel's new Arab-state allies. It was Lapid who hosted the historic Negev summit, where the top diplomatic representatives from the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco, Egypt and the United States met in southern Israel for the first time in March 2022.  But ultimately it was the coalition's ideological diversity that was also the source of its fragility. It lost its parliamentary majority when two members of Bennett's own right-wing party defected. And when some left-leaning members refused to support a recurring bill that among other things, gives Israeli settlers in the West Bank the same civil rights as citizens in Israel, the coalition reached a political impasse.  In a shock move, Lapid and Bennett announced last week they would dissolve their own government and trigger new elections, making Lapid interim prime minister.  Standing together in a show of solidarity, Lapid told Bennett ""I love you,"" a moment of outward bromance that surprised many in the Israeli media.  Lapid will be the first non-right-wing prime minister of Israel in more than a decade. He now has four months to convince the public he should keep the job. Elections will be held on November 1.  The digest  Unilever sells Ben & Jerry's Israel business after controversy  Unilever has sold its Ben & Jerry's business in Israel for an undisclosed amount to American Quality Products (AQP), which distributes Ben & Jerry's in the country, following the controversy related to its activities in Israel and the West Bank. Critics took the company to task for doing business in Israel -- especially in West Bank settlements, considered illegal under international law -- arguing it doesn't align with Ben & Jerry's liberal image. Ben & Jerry's will now be sold under its Hebrew and Arabic names throughout Israel and the West Bank  Background: Unilever said Wednesday that it ""has used the opportunity of the past year to listen to perspectives on this complex and sensitive matter and believes this is the best outcome for Ben & Jerry's in Israel."" The ice cream company, however, tweeted that it doesn't agree with Unilever's announcement. ""We continue to believe it is inconsistent with Ben & Jerry's values for our ice cream to be sold in the Occupied Palestinian Territory,"" it tweeted, adding it will no longer profit from Ben & Jerry's in Israel.  Why it matters: The sale ends a long saga that had angered ice cream fans on every side of the Israel-Palestine conflict, but it also highlights the challenges facing consumer brands doing business in the region.     Egyptian court sentences to death man accused of killing a 21-year-old student   A man accused of fatally stabbing a woman last week after she rejected his advances was sentenced to death by a state court in Egypt, according to state-run Al Ahram on Tuesday.    Background: The verdict, issued after two court sessions, will be deferred to Egypt's top Islamic authority, the Grand Mufti -- a formality in death penalty cases in the country,  Al-Ahram said. The final verdict will be announced on July 6. The sentence  can still be appealed in Egypt's court of cassation, as per Egyptian law.   Why it matters: The killing of the woman, Naira Ashraf, in broad daylight was caught on film and left the Arab world in shock as activists called for justice and more protection for women.    Erdogan says Sweden has promised to extradite 73 people as part of NATO deal  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Sweden promised to extradite 73 people to Turkey as a result of the memorandum that was signed at the NATO summit in Madrid  between Sweden, Finland and Turkey. In signing the agreement, Turkey has agreed to support Finland and Sweden's NATO membership bids, removing the last major hurdle to the two countries joining the alliance. ""If the promise is not kept, we will do what is necessary in the agreement,""  Erdogan said at a news conference on Thursday, adding that Turkey would not ratify the agreement.  Background: Turkey previously said it would  veto Sweden and Finland's NATO membership bids claiming they harbor members of Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which Turkey, the EU and the US recognize as a terror organization. The 10-article memorandum says Sweden and Finland will address Turkey's pending extradition requests of terror suspects in accordance with the European Convention on Extradition.   Why it matters:  Sweden and Finland formally ending decades of neutrality and joining NATO would be a historic breakthrough for the alliance, and deal a blow to Russian President Vladimir Putin.  Around the region  An ancient tomb dating as far back as 2,400 years to the Roman era has been unearthed by archeologists in the Gaza Strip, showcasing the coastal enclave's rich history.   Situated on the coast of northern Gaza, the tomb is a momentous find for the Palestinians living in the territory.   The tomb is part of a larger Roman cemetery that was discovered by accident earlier this year, said Jehad Abu Hassan, the Gaza Strip field coordinator for Premiere Urgence Internationale, a French NGO that is involved in helping to preserve Gaza's heritage. ""This is the first time a Roman cemetery has been found in Gaza."" The NGO has also supported work at another archeological site in central Gaza called Saint Hilarion.  It's not uncommon for relics to be excavated in this region due to its historical geographic significance, which meant various civilizations moved through the area over the centuries.  The tomb is part of an ongoing archeological dig that has been in progress for months, where Abu Hassan says 40 graves have been found.   ""It's great that we protect and keep this rich heritage of Gaza for future generations,"" he told CNN. ""When we talk to children about their heritage they are very happy to see that people were coming from everywhere [to Gaza].""  The tombs stand out due to the social standing of those  people they belonged to, according to a Palestinian official in Gaza.  ""Some of the graves were decorated with elegant decorations,"" said Mohammed Khalla, undersecretary for Gaza's Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, speaking to Quds Press news agency. ""Which indicates they belonged to figures who had a social and administrative status in Roman society at the time.""  The ministry said it is in the process of securing the necessary funding to preserve the site, according to Quds Press.  Interest in protecting the tomb arises from its location near the Anthedon (Blakhiyah) harbor, Gaza's first port and a landmark that played a crucial role in connecting the territory to Europe thousands of years ago.

"Israeli parliament votes to dissolve, triggering fifth election in four years",2022-06-30,"The Israeli parliament, the Knesset, voted Thursday to dissolve itself, triggering new elections.  On Friday, Foreign Minister Yair Lapid will officially take over as caretaker prime minister under the terms of a coalition agreement made between outgoing Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and Lapid last year. Because Lapid -- a former journalist and star TV anchor -- is a caretaker prime minister, there will be no formal swearing-in ceremony. Thursday's 92-0 vote finally concludes the slow motion ending to Bennett's run as prime minister -- one of the shortest terms in Israeli history -- and gives former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a potential path to return to power.   As the vote concluded, Lapid and Bennett wrapped their arms around each other, hugged and switched seats so that Lapid was sitting in the prime minister's position. When they were departing the Knesset floor, Bennett accidentally took Lapid's cellphone. ""My brother,"" Lapid said, ""you took my phone."" Bennett replied, ""My brother, you took my job."" New elections will be held on November 1 -- the fifth round of voting for Israelis in less than four years. Recent polling shows former ​prime minister Netanyahu's Likud party on track to win the most number of seats, but the polls do not show that his right-wing bloc will necessarily have enough seats to gain a parliamentary majority and be able to form a ruling government.  Speaking on the parliament floor before the dissolution vote, Netanyahu vowed to return to power. ""We are the only alternative: a strong national government, stable and responsible.  A government that will return the national honor to the citizens of Israel,"" Netanyahu said. The night before the dissolution, Bennett announced he would be stepping back from politics and would not run for re-election. ""I will remain a loyal soldier of this country, which I have served all my life as a soldier, officer, minister and prime minister. The State of Israel is the love of my life. To serve her is my destiny,"" Bennett said in a speech to the nation. ""Now is my time to step back a little. Look at things from the outside."" The coalition government had been teetering for weeks.  But Bennett and Lapid's announcement ​last week that they wanted to dissolve their own government and hand power to Lapid came as a surprise.  ""In the last few weeks, we did everything we could to save this government. ​In our eyes, the continuation of its existence was in the national interest,"" Bennett said earlier this month, standing alongside Lapid.  ""Believe me, we looked under every rock. We didn't do this for ourselves, but for our beautiful country, for you citizens of Israel,"" Bennett added. The Bennett-Lapid government was sworn into office in June last year bringing an end to Netanyahu's premiership, which had lasted more than 12 years. Made up of no fewer than eight political parties, the coalition stretched right across the political spectrum, including for the first time an Arab party, led by Mansour Abbas. United in a desire to prevent Netanyahu -- whose corruption trial had already begun in May 2020 -- from remaining in power, the disparate coalition partners agreed to put their substantial differences to one side. Although it notched significant domestic and diplomatic achievements, it was internal politics that ultimately brought the coalition down.  Recent weeks have seen a number of coalition members either quitting, or threatening to quit, leaving the government without a majority in parliament to pass legislation. The political impasse came to a head earlier this month, when a Knesset vote failed to uphold the application of Israeli criminal and civil law to Israelis in the occupied West Bank. Among other things, the regulation, which comes up for renewal every five years, gives Israeli settlers ​in Palestinian territories the same legal treatment as ​they have within Israel's borders, and is an article of faith for right-wing members of the coalition, including Prime Minister Bennett. But two members of the coalition ​refused to support the bill, meaning it failed to pass.  Because parliament dissolved before the law expired on July 1, the regulation will remain in place until a new government is formed​, at which time it will again go up for a vote.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",34,85.0,0.0,0.8889999999999999,0.111,0.7191666666666667,0.032,0.85,0.119,0.9961,24.451666666666668,408.94463333333334,591.0,0.6919536943034406

School Shootings After the deadliest school massacre in almost a decade, the governors of Texas and Iowa this week announced commitments of at least $100 million each to try to help prevent similar tragedies. It was last month in Texas where an 18-year-old gunman opened fire with an AR-15 style rifle at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, killing 19 children and two teachers. The funding in Texas will be allocated toward school safety and mental health initiatives, including money for bullet-resistant shields and for school districts to buy silent panic alert technology, Gov. Greg Abbott said. In Iowa, funding will be used to increase staffing of special agents, criminal intelligence analysts and communication specialists dedicated to school safety. This comes after school shootings in the US reached a 20-year high in 2021, federal data shows.  3. January 6 Republican Rep. Liz Cheney delivered a searing rebuke of former President Donald Trump and GOP leaders at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library Wednesday night, recounting some of the damning details that the House select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection has uncovered thus far and praising the bravery of witnesses -- particularly the young female aides -- who have come forward to aid its investigation. ""We are confronting a domestic threat that we have never faced before -- and that is a former President who is attempting to unravel the foundations of our constitutional Republic,"" Cheney said. Her remarks come after former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson delivered shocking testimony before the House select committee this week, increasing the potential criminal exposure Trump faces in the Justice Department's ongoing probe. 4. Ukraine NATO formally invited Sweden and Finland to join its alliance Wednesday, a historic expansion of the defense bloc that directly undercuts Russian President Vladimir Putin's aims as his war in Ukraine grinds on. Putin issued a fresh warning over the countries' bids to join NATO, saying that while Russia would not be bothered by the two countries joining the bloc, it would ""respond symmetrically"" to any military or infrastructure buildup. Separately, Putin on Wednesday denied Moscow was behind a strike on a shopping center in Ukraine that killed at least 18 people, with dozens missing and wounded. ""The Russian army does not attack any civilian site,"" he claimed. Russia's Defense Ministry previously said it hit military targets but video from the city of Kremenchuk shows the mall being obliterated by a missile. 5. Israel The Israeli parliament, the Knesset, has voted to dissolve itself, triggering what will be the fifth round of voting for Israelis in less than four years. The 92-0 vote today brings an end to Prime Minister Naftali Bennett's run as the country's leader -- one of the shortest terms in Israeli history -- and gives former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a path to return to power. The coalition government had been facing weeks of mounting political uncertainty in Israel, but the announcement last week of the move to dissolve parliament still came as a surprise.

Is there any way out of Israel's neverending election cycle?,2022-06-22,"It was just over a year ago that a shared desire to oust Benjamin Netanyahu as the longest-serving Israeli prime minister united eight disparate political parties to form the most diverse coalition in Israeli history. They succeeded - but it may be short-lived.      As the Israeli public waits for parliament, the Knesset, to be dissolved next week and Yair Lapid to become caretaker prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu and his supporters have been celebrating.      A fifth round of elections in less than four years will likely be held sometime in the fall. And despite the fact that Netanyahu is in the midst of witness testimonies in an ongoing corruption trial, he could be back in power in a matter of months.      CNN spoke to Yohanan Plesner, a former Member of Knesset (MK) with the now defunct Kadima party, now president of the Israel Democracy Institute, a think tank in Jerusalem, about what may happen next.     What are the next steps? Is Prime Minister Naftali Bennett's main coalition partner Yair Lapid guaranteed to become the next premier?   If the bill to dissolve the Knesset passes, then Lapid will automatically become the prime minister until a new government is formed after elections. If the election is inconclusive, and no one is able to form a new government, Lapid's term in office would continue and the country would head back to another election.      Until the dissolution bill passes, there is still a chance that someone else -- Netanyahu, for example -- could instead form an alternative government in the current Knesset.   When will elections be held?     Assuming the Knesset votes to dissolve itself, it will also set a date for the election. It will have to be after at least ninety days, and within five months. The coalition and the opposition usually reach an agreement on the exact date, with the most likely options being either at the end of October or the beginning of November.      What path does Netanyahu have to return to power? Can he do so without elections?     To return to power without an election, Netanyahu would need to convince 61 members of the current Knesset to vote in support of a government that he would lead. Given that the six-seat, mostly Arab-supported Joint List have said they will not do so, Netanyahu's allies would need to convince at least seven additional members of the current coalition to join them. The heads of parties of the current coalition have all stated that they will not do so and would rather head to an election than sit in a Netanyahu-led government.        What are his chances of winning the most seats in the next election?     All the polls are now indicating that Netanyahu's Likud party will win the most seats in the parliament at around 35 seats in the 120-seat parliament. Israel's parliamentary system demands that the governing coalition be supported by at least 61 MKs, so winning the most seats does not by itself guarantee that Netanyahu will return to the Prime Minister's office. For that to happen, the Likud leader needs other right-wing and religious parties, which would support him in government, to poll strongly. Polls indicate that Netanyahu's 'bloc' is currently on track to receive around 58 to 60 seats.     Is there a way out of this endless cycle of elections in Israel?      On average, Israel has held elections every 2.6 years since 1996. This ongoing crisis will not come to an end until Israel's leaders put their political differences aside and enact long over-due electoral and constitutional reforms, such as making any attempt to initiate early elections dependent on a two-thirds majority in parliament and amending the current law that demands new elections when a budget fails to pass.     What is the root cause of this political deadlock?     This perfect storm of political dysfunction is the result of a systematic failure of our electoral system, coupled with the unique situation in which a candidate for prime minister is on trial and therefore members of his own political camp won't sit with him in government. It is likely to continue until one of the sides receives a substantial majority in parliament, or Netanyahu decides to take a break from public life until his legal issues are resolved.     The digest  Middle East states pressure Biden to come up with strategy to contain Iran   On a visit to Washington earlier this month, Saudi Deputy Defense Minister Khalid bin Salman expressed concerns that the US had still not articulated a comprehensive strategy for dealing with Iran's nuclear ambitions, ballistic missile arsenal and support for regional militant groups, sources familiar with the discussions told CNN.  Background: The US has said that prospects of reaching a nuclear agreement with Iran are tenuous, and Middle East officials have said that the administration hasn't yet told its allies what ""Plan B"" would be should the talks fail. Sources said the administration has said that it would keep up the economic pressure on Iran and ramp up sanctions enforcement should a deal fall through. The US has also been working to build a regional coalition against Iran, urging the Gulf countries to integrate all their air and missile defense systems against Iranian attacks.   Why it matters: Concerns over potential Iranian escalation have fueled a broader diplomatic shift between Israel and the Gulf countries, leading to normalization agreements with Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. The precarious security environment has led Israel to push heavily for Biden to visit Saudi Arabia and meet with the Saudi Crown Prince, multiple officials said.    Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov due in Iran  Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was due to arrive in Tehran on Wednesday to discuss the Iran nuclear deal and the situation in Ukraine, the Russian foreign ministry said. The trip would be his first under the administration of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi.  Background: The visit will be the latest in a series of trips made by Russian officials to Iran. Last month, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak met with Iranian Petroleum Minister Javad Owji in Tehran to discuss swapping supplies for oil and gas, according to Russia's TASS news agency.  
Why it matters: The meeting comes as Russia tries to strengthen ties with traditional allies amid Western sanctions on its economy and energy exports. Russia and Iran, both under Western sanctions, sit on some of the world's largest oil reserves. Russia is also part of the talks Iran is holding with world powers to revive its 2015 nuclear agreement.  Turkish parliament set to debate media bill decried by journalists  Protesters demonstrated in Istanbul on Tuesday against a media bill that Turkey's government says will fight ""disinformation,"" but which media rights groups argue will double down on a years-long crackdown on critical reporting.  Background: The legislation is one of a series of steps during President Tayyip Erdogan's two decades in power that have driven concerns among rights groups about a muzzling of the minority of media outlets where dissent and critical views are still aired. Parliament was expected to begin debating the bill on Wednesday.  Why it matters: A key concern among critics of the bill is an article saying those who spread false information about the country's security and public order to create fear and disturb the public peace will face a prison sentence of one to three years. The bill would also subject digital media to the same regulations as traditional media.   Around the region  For years, tourists arriving in Lebanon were used to seeing politically charged tributes to Hezbollah leaders, Lebanese martyrs and even slain Iranian general Qasem Soleimani upon leaving Beirut airport. That's no longer the case.  Those billboards on the highway out of the country's only airport are now being replaced with images of landmarks and tourist hotspots.   The project is the brainchild of Minister of Tourism Walid Nassar, who said in an interview with local media that the political banners had not been appreciated by tourists.  Nassar asked the media teams from Hezbollah and its allies in the Amal movement, ""with love and respect,"" to give some of the advertising space around the highway to promote Lebanon's tourist destinations ""at least for the next four months,"" he said in an interview with Al Jadeed News this month. Hezbollah obliged and the new banners came up late last week.  ""I never thought I'd live to see the day when Beirut Airport could look so Lebanese,"" said a Twitter user.   Reeling from an economic collapse, the government has been trying to put the country back on the tourist map. Secretary-General of the Federation of Tourism Establishments Jean Beiruti told the local MTV channel this month that reservations were picking up in mountainous and coastal areas. ""We should congratulate ourselves,"" he said.  By Mohammed Abdelbary  800 The number of Syrian refugees returning to their country from Turkey every week.

Israel set for possible fifth election in four years as PM Bennett moves to dissolve parliament,2022-06-20,"Israel's Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has effectively called time on his premiership after just a year in the job. Along with his key coalition ally Foreign Minister Yair Lapid -- who now looks set to replace him as leader as early as next week -- Bennett has agreed to submit a bill to dissolve parliament, which if passed would trigger a general election later this year. The announcement followed weeks of mounting political uncertainty in Israel, but still came as a major surprise. A short statement from the Prime Minister's Office said the move came ""after attempts to stabilize the coalition had been exhausted."" A bill would be submitted to parliament at some point next week, the statement added. If it is passed, Lapid will become the country's fourteenth Prime Minister, in line with the original coalition agreement struck last year. It also means Israelis will be going to the polls for the fifth time in under four years. Among the first items on Lapid's agenda, assuming he does become leader, will be preparing for the visit of US President Joe Biden next month. A senior administration official said the President's trip to the Middle East is still expected to go ahead despite the political shakeup in Israel. ""We have a strategic relationship with Israel that goes beyond any one government. The President looks forward to the visit next month,"" the White House official said. The Bennett-Lapid government was sworn into office in June last year bringing an end to the premiership of Benjamin Netanyahu, which had lasted some twelve and a half years. Made up of no fewer than eight political parties, the coalition stretched right across the political spectrum, including for the first time an Arab party, led by Mansour Abbas. United in a desire to prevent Netanyahu -- whose corruption trial had already begun in May 2020 -- from remaining in power, the disparate coalition partners agreed to put their substantial differences to one side. In November, it notched up a significant domestic achievement, passing a state budget for the first time in nearly four years. But recent weeks have seen a number of coalition members either quitting, or threatening to quit, leaving the government without a majority in parliament to pass legislation. The political impasse came to a head earlier this month, when a Knesset vote failed to uphold the application of Israeli criminal and civil law to Israelis in the occupied West Bank. Among other things, the regulation, which comes up for renewal every five years, gives Israeli settlers the same rights as citizens in Israel, and is an article of faith for right-wing members of the coalition, including Prime Minister Bennett. But two members of the coalition failed to support the bill, meaning it failed to pass. If parliament dissolves before July 1st, the regulation will remain in place until a new government is formed. Speaking alongside Lapid on Monday evening, Bennett said their government had swept away what he called the bitterness and paralysis of the Netanyahu era, instead putting decency and trust back center stage. ""In the last few weeks, we did everything we could to save this government. In our eyes, the continuation of its existence was in the national interest. Believe me, we looked under every rock. We didn't do this for ourselves, but for our beautiful country, for you, the citizens of Israel."" For his part, Lapid paid tribute to Bennett as a brave and innovative leader. And he appeared to offer a stark warning of the dangers posed by a return to the leadership of Netanyahu. ""What we need to do today is go back to the concept of Israeli unity. Not to let dark forces tear us apart from within,"" he said. Netanyahu, by contrast, was upbeat, saying the country was smiling after what he called an evening of great news. ""After a determined struggle by the opposition in the Knesset, and great suffering by the public in Israel, it is clear to everyone that the most dismal government in the history of the country has ended."" Netanyahu and his supporters have been buoyed by the most recent opinion polls, which show his bloc of right-wing and religious parties performing strongly, though still not strongly enough to secure a majority in parliament.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",32,88.0,0.05566666666666667,0.7861666666666666,0.15816666666666668,0.3934,0.066,0.798,0.136,0.9948,12.5888,84.24589333333333,240.0,0.3510245555555555

(You can get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Gas Prices President Joe Biden is considering backing a plan to send Americans gas rebate cards to help fight soaring prices at the pump. Although the White House has previously downplayed the prospect of such a program because it would be difficult to administer, Biden told reporters on Monday the plan has not been ruled out. He also said he plans to decide whether to support a temporary suspension of the federal gasoline tax. Such a pause in the 18.3-cent-per-gallon federal tax would require Congress to act, and there has been little traction among lawmakers on the idea so far. Meanwhile, despite high gas prices and the prospect of a recession looming, Americans are on track to set a road trip record for July 4, AAA predicts. Approximately 42 million Americans -- more than ever -- will take a road trip of 50 miles or more during the holiday weekend, the automotive group said.  2. Ukraine Ukrainian troops are resisting a heavy Russian offensive in and around the city of Severodonetsk in the Luhansk region, despite the continued bombardment from several directions, according to the Ukrainian military. Russian forces have tried to carry out offensive operations under cover of heavy shelling, the head of the Luhansk regional military administration said, but they are having trouble dislodging the determined Ukrainian resistance. Officials say Russian forces are making modest gains and have resorted to one principal tactic: fire at any and all Ukrainian positions to leave nothing standing that can be defended. Separately, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Monday that Ukraine is moving along the path to becoming part of the European Union. The EU is deciding this week whether the country should be formally considered for candidate status. 3. January 6 The House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol will focus today's hearing on how former President Donald Trump and his allies pressured state-level officials to overturn the 2020 election results. The hearing will specifically unpack Trump's efforts to overturn the results in Arizona and in Georgia -- where Trump infamously asked Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to ""find"" the votes he needed to win. Committee aides said the hearing will also demonstrate how Trump and his allies concocted a scheme to submit fake slates of electors. The committee will also show video testimony of depositions from officials in other states where Trump and his allies pressured state-level officials to try to block Biden's election win. 4. Israel Israel is gearing up for another general election after Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and his key coalition ally, Foreign Minister Yair Lapid, agreed to submit a bill to dissolve parliament. If passed, it would trigger the election later this year -- making it the fifth time Israelis will be going to the polls in under four years. The announcement followed weeks of mounting political uncertainty in Israel but still came as a major surprise. A short statement from the prime minister's office said the move came ""after attempts to stabilize the coalition had been exhausted.""

Coronavirus Covid-19 vaccines for children younger than 5 are rolling out this week following a recent sign-off from the FDA and CDC. The safety data from Moderna and Pfizer found potential side effects were mostly mild and short-lived. Side effects most commonly included pain at the injection site and sometimes there was swelling or redness. As far as systemic or body-wide symptoms, the most common were fatigue or sleepiness. Some children had irritability or fussiness, loss of appetite, headache, abdominal pain or discomfort, enlarged lymph nodes, mild diarrhea, or vomiting.

How a failed vote on Jewish settlers shows the Israeli government is teetering,2022-06-10,"Efforts by former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his allies to bring down the country's governing coalition risk hurting the very cause the Israeli right has always championed: Jewish settlers in the West Bank.   Prime Minister Naftali Bennett's coalition lost a critical vote this week in parliament to renew measures that govern legal rights for the settlers, another major dent in the government's armor, although not yet the fatal blow.  The defeat shows the fragility of Israel's ruling coalition and how parliamentary gridlock could bring issues of national importance to a complete halt.   The right-wing prime minister leads a coalition of unlikely bedfellows from across the political spectrum, including the first Arab party to sit in an Israeli government. The coalition lost its razor-thin one-seat majority when a member of Bennett's own party decamped in April.   This week's vote to renew an Israeli law covering settlers in the West Bank exposed all the fault lines in Bennett's coalition of unlikely allies.   Because the law provides for Jewish settlers in the West Bank to be treated legally like Israelis, most left-wing and Arab members of Bennett's coalition oppose it in principle -- they are against the settlements.  But in order to keep the Bennett government in power, most of them voted for the law anyway.  And in a twist of politics, right-wing opposition parties including Netanyahu's Likud voted against it -- despite being ideological supporters of the settlers -- as part of an effort to hurt the coalition regardless of the cost.  The opposition's political ploy could have far-reaching consequences beyond weakening Bennett.   Monday's vote was to renew regulations that govern how Jewish settlers are treated in the West Bank under Israeli law. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, which considers the West Bank to be occupied territory. Israel rejects that, saying the status of the West Bank is more complicated than international law allows.  Despite the controversy about the legal status of the settlements, for decades the regulations have been renewed on a regular basis with little fanfare by left- and right-wing governments.   If the bill to renew the regulations isn't passed by the end of June, Jewish settlers could find themselves in legal limbo. But some settlers likely support these political maneuvers as a way to bring down the coalition government, even if it complicates their day-to-day lives.   The bill can be brought back for a new vote every Monday and Wednesday until the end of the month. And while there may be short-term legal workarounds should the deadline pass, another scenario is that the government could dissolve before the end of June, which would automatically extend the regulations currently in place until after a new government is formed.  But while the government is on shaky ground, its fall isn't inevitable. Netanyahu's opposition bloc still doesn't have the 61 votes needed to dissolve the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, but he's very close, and under some calculations needs to attract just one defector from Bennett's coalition.   If Netanyahu does succeed in dissolving parliament it would trigger new elections, less than two years since the last vote.     The digest UN nuclear watchdog warns of 'fatal blow' to nuclear deal as Iran removes cameras  Iran is removing essentially all the extra International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) monitoring equipment that was installed under the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement, meaning there are only three to four weeks before it becomes impossible to revive the deal, according to  IAEA chief Rafael Grossi.  Background: Iran had warned of retaliation if the IAEA's board of governors passed a resolution drafted by the United States, France, Britain and Germany criticizing Tehran for its failure to explain uranium traces found at undeclared sites. The resolution was passed by a majority on Wednesday. Iran told the agency overnight it planned to remove equipment, including 27 IAEA cameras installed under the 2015 deal.  Why it matters: Iran's decisions could further damage prospects for rescuing  the nuclear deal. Indirect talks on that between Iran and the  US are already stalled.  Watch Grossi's interview with CNN's Becky Anderson here.    Algeria suspends Spain treaty, bars imports over Western Sahara  Algeria suspended a 20-year-old friendship treaty with Spain that committed the two sides to cooperation in controlling migration flows, and also banned imports from Spain, escalating a spat  over Madrid's stance on Western Sahara.   Background: Algeria was angered when Spain said in March it supported a Moroccan plan to offer autonomy to Western Sahara. Algeria backs the Polisario Front movement seeking full independence for the territory, which Morocco regards as its own and mostly controls.   Why it matters: Migrant flows have sharply increased across the Mediterranean this year as the pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine has hit the global economy. On Wednesday, 113 undocumented migrants arrived in Spain using a route that Spanish authorities said tended to be used by boats coming from Algeria. Algeria is also a key gas supplier to Spain, but Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune has previously said he would not break the supply contract over the dispute.    Saudi sponsored golf event begins amid controversy  The LIV Invitational Series, a divisive Saudi Arabian-backed breakaway golf  tour, began on Thursday as 48 players teed off at the Centurion Club north of London. The PGA Tour has suspended all current and future players who have decided to join the new tournament.  Background: The PGA Tour and the Europe-based DP World Tour have declined requests from members for releases to compete at Centurion, where finishing last guarantees a check of $120,000.   Why it matters: The event has been referred to as the richest in golf history. It offers $25 million per event in prize money with $4 million going to this week's individual winner. Critics say the series, bank-rolled to the tune of $250 million by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) amounts to 'sportswashing' by a nation trying to improve its reputation.  What's trending  Regional: #George_Kordahi  The man who caused a rupture in Saudi-Lebanese relations last year has become the subject of a new controversy.  Social media users from Gulf Arab states expressed anger at former Lebanese information minister George Kordahi for comments he made two weeks ago on an Iraqi TV station saying oil-rich Gulf states provide no help to the Levantine state as it suffers a crippling economic crisis.  ""The Gulf states have not given a single drop of water to Lebanon,"" said Kordahi.    Some Twitter users shared news reports showing how Saudi aid to Lebanon dwarfs contributions from its regional rival, Iran. One user accused Kordahi of fulfilling ""Iran's agenda"" in the Middle East.   The former minister, who first became famous for hosting the Arabic version of ""Who wants to be a millionaire,"" last October sparked a breakdown in Gulf-Lebanese relations after openly criticizing the Saudi-led coalition's war in Yemen. Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries subsequently withdrew their ambassadors from Beirut and Kordahi later resigned.  Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states returned their ambassadors to Beirut this year.   19,100  The number of Syrians who became German citizens in 2021.

Israeli government's fragility laid bare as violence spikes,2022-04-20,"The 10-month-old Israeli coalition government is facing its deepest political crisis to date, after weeks of high-profile attacks across Israel, military action in the West Bank, and after Israeli police entered and arrested hundreds at one of Jerusalem's holiest sites.     From its inception, the coalition government had a razor thin margin, made up of a historically diverse lineup of political parties from the far left to the right wing, including the first Arab party to be an active member of a government coalition.   Because of that diverse makeup, the government said early on that it had no intention of tackling the most contentious issues in Israeli politics. But escalations in recent weeks have placed those issues front and center.   Its one-seat majority in parliament was lost earlier this month when Idit Silman, a member of Prime Minister Naftali Bennett's own party, defected. The move sent political shockwaves throughout Israel but did not necessarily mean the current government would collapse, especially since the opposition, led by former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, doesn't have the numbers for a majority itself.      But that could be changing. In recent days, during commemorations of both Passover and Ramadan, Israeli police say they arrested more than 300 people at the al-Aqsa mosque compound, where police say people throwing rocks and launching fireworks were jeopardizing safe worship. The Palestinian Red Crescent said scores of people were injured by rubber bullets, stun grenades, and police batons. The presence of Israeli police inside the mosque itself became a flashpoint, as it is regarded as offensive to Muslims and puts a strain on a decades-old ""status quo"" agreement about the site. In response, the United Arab List party, also known by its acronym Ra'am, suspended its membership in the coalition to protest what it said was Israeli police violence at the holy site that is sacred to both Jews and Muslims.     ""If the government continues its steps against Al-Quds and its people, Al-Aqsa, its worshipers and its sanctuaries in this holy month, we will submit a collective resignation, and we call on all parties to cooperate with and support this decision,"" party members said in a statement.    For the moment, the action has no immediate consequences -- Israel's parliament, the Knesset, is in recess for a few more weeks and by the time it returns, the party could decide to sit with the coalition once again.      But if even just one member of the UAL party defects from the coalition, Netanyahu could potentially have the numbers in hand to call for a vote to dissolve parliament and trigger new elections, giving him a pathway back to power.      Never before in Israeli history has the fate of a government been in the hands of an Arab, non-Jewish party. Without UAL's support, the coalition would never have taken power. And even before joining the government, party leader Mansour Abbas had said that while he's a proud member of the government with the aim of improving the lives of the approximately 20% of Israel's population that identifies as Arab, he has his own ""red lines"" -- though it remains unclear exactly where those lines are.     ""I said and I continue to say that the blessed Al-Aqsa Mosque is a red line in which there is no compromise,"" Abbas wrote in a Facebook post last week. ""This is what I conveyed today in my conversation with the officials with whom I communicated, and I explained to them my position.""    Apart from Abbas' vaunted leverage in the governing coalition, there are other officials whose influence may be moderating the response of Israeli police. as well. Israeli Minister of Public Security Omer Bar Lev is a member of the left-leaning Labor Party. And Defense Minister Benny Gantz has pushed forward increasing the number of work permits, believing that giving Palestinians more economic opportunity will bring more calm.      In Jerusalem, Israeli officials believe they have shown restraint in policing tactics on Palestinians around the mosque and Old City. Israeli media report police have been more reserved in their responses during clashes than in previous incidents and haven't employed the kind of tactics that inflamed tensions during Ramadan last year, like barring people from gathering at the Damascus Gate plaza.    Israeli officials emphasized that even after the worst of the clashes on Friday, more than 50,000 Muslim worshippers attended prayers at the compound peacefully, although at various points since then Muslim worshippers were blocked from Al Aqsa as police accompanied Jewish groups and foreign tourists on scheduled visits.     The compound is often a flashpoint in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It lies in East Jerusalem, which most of the international community regards as having been under Israeli occupation since 1967. Israel disputes that and claims all of Jerusalem as its undivided capital, while Palestinians want the eastern sector as the capital of their future state.      This Ramadan, Israeli restrictions on movement of Palestinians between the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem have not been as tight as before for those with Israeli-issued permits.      At the same time though, Israel has launched raids across the West Bank in response to Palestinian attacks, and 14 Palestinians have died since late March in clashes with Israeli security forces or been shot dead by Israeli soldiers for allegedly throwing Molotov cocktails or running towards soldiers at a checkpoint.       The real test for the Israeli government will come in early May, when parliament comes back into session. That is when the true fragility of their position will be made clear.    
 Other top Middle East news  Watchdog claims Middle East states, others spied on UK government   Digital rights watchdog group Citizen Lab said on Monday it had warned British officials that electronic devices connected to government networks, including some inside the prime minister's office and foreign ministry, appeared to be infected with Israeli-made spy software. It said the government was targeted by the United Arab Emirates, Cyprus, Jordan and India.  Background: The spy software allegedly used is known as Pegasus, a product of Israeli cyber arms dealer NSO Group. An NSO spokesperson told Reuters the allegations were ""false."" A British government spokesperson refused to comment on security matters, and government spokespeople for the UAE, Jordan and India didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. Cyprus authorities ""categorically"" denied involvement to Reuters.  Why it matters: Both Jordan and the UAE enjoy good relations with the UK and the allegations are likely to embarrass them.   UAE summons Israeli ambassador to protest Jerusalem violence   The UAE foreign ministry summoned the Israeli ambassador to protest the treatment of Palestinians in Jerusalem by Israeli forces, the foreign ministry said in a statement on Tuesday.  Background: More than 150 people were injured in clashes with Israeli police on Friday, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent. The Emirati minister of state for international cooperation Reem Al Hashimi told Israel's ambassador Amir Hayek that the UAE ""strongly protests"" attacks on ""civilians and incursions into holy places,"" the statement added.   Why it matters: Since spearheading a wave of Arab normalization agreements with the Jewish state in 2020, this is the first time the UAE has summoned Israel's envoy.    Turkey arrests journalist over posts on personal information leak  Turkish authorities jailed a journalist on Tuesday pending trial after he announced hackers had stolen personal information from government websites and shared some of it with him, including President Tayyip Erdogan's ID card, as proof, his lawyer said.  Background: The independent journalist, Ibrahim Haskologlu, posted the announcement on Twitter, illustrating it with a partially obscured photo of what he said was Erdogan's ID. His lawyer, Emrah Karatay, said his client was arrested on a charge of illegally obtaining and disseminating personal information due to his social media posts.  Why it matters: As well as sharing the purported photo of Erdogan's ID, Haskologlu also published an image of what he said was the ID card of Hakan Fidan, head of Turkey's National Intelligence Agency. Most of the information on the cards was concealed. Turkey is one of the world's top jailers of journalists and mainstream media is controlled by those close to Erdogan's government.   Around the region  This Ramadan, drama went beyond the screen with the premiere of television series ""From the pyramid road to..."" about a love triangle that involves a sultry Egyptian woman and a Kuwaiti couple.   The Saudi state-owned channel MBC's broadcast of  the Kuwaiti family drama is raising eyebrows in the Kuwaiti government and as far away as Egypt.   Written by Kuwaiti writer Hiba Hamada, the show follows the struggle between Abla, a doctor and wife of a wealthy Kuwaiti, and an Egyptian belly dancer trying to drive a wedge between them for self-interest. Kareema, the dancer, is hired to perform at the wedding of Abla's son. After the celebrations, she is unable to return home and stays at Abla's family home, where she tries to seduce her husband.   The show touches on topics deemed controversial in Kuwait such as gender roles and relations and has prompted accusations of stereotyping on social media. In one scene, Abla is shown lecturing her son about men's perceptions of women's clothing, saying women will be harassed in Kuwait no matter what they wear. Egyptians took issue with the portrayal of Egyptian women as dancers chasing after wealthy men from the Gulf.   The controversy led the Kuwaiti ministry of information to distance itself from the show, saying on Twitter that it ""is not produced by a Kuwaiti company, has been filmed outside Kuwait, and is broadcast on platforms outside of Kuwait."" While the show was filmed in the UAE, the ministry said it will launch an investigation into any scenes that may have been filmed within Kuwait without a permit.

Israel's coalition government loses its majority as right-wing lawmaker quits,2022-04-06,"Israel's government was dealt a major blow on Wednesday when coalition chairwoman Idit Silman resigned, depriving the government of its majority.  ""Key values in my worldview are inconsistent with current reality,"" she wrote in a letter sent to Prime Minister Naftali Bennett. ""I can no longer bear the damage to values that are our essence and right.""  She called for a right-wing government to be formed instead.  The letter did not make specific reference to government policies, but Silman has recently voiced her opposition to plans to liberalize certain prayer rules at the Western Wall in Jerusalem, as well as instructions to allow people to bring chametz -- food that is not kosher for Passover -- into hospitals during the upcoming Jewish holiday.  A spokesperson for the Prime Minister, from whose Yamina party Silman hails, declined to comment.  By contrast, former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was quick to congratulate Silman for her decision. In a tweeted video, he said: ""I call on everyone that was chosen with the votes of the [right-wing and religious] national camp to join Idit and return to our home."" It was not immediately clear what happens next. Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute, says the government will only fall if there is majority support for the dissolution of the Knesset -- which is in recess until May 8 -- or if there is a majority in parliament in favor of an alternative to the current coalition. ""Neither avenue is guaranteed,"" he told CNN, noting that the coalition still holds 60 of the Knesset's 120 seats. Netanyahu's bloc holds just 54. There is ""zero"" chance, Plesner said, that the Joint List -- a mainly Arab party that holds six seats and is not part of any bloc -- would support Netanyahu. ""What we can be sure of is that the coalition and country is turning back to crisis mode,"" he said. ""But how this crisis will pan out is unclear.""   The current coalition government was formed on June 13, 2021, after four elections were held in under two years. It comprises eight parties, spanning the spectrum of ideologies -- from the left-wing Meretz party, to New Hope and Yamina on the right. For the first time ever, it also includes an Arab party, the United Arab List. Under the terms of the coalition agreement, the leader of the government's largest party, current foreign minister Yair Lapid, is due to succeed Prime Minister Naftali Bennett in August 2023.","{'neg': 0.204, 'neu': 0.796, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.3182}",18,92.0,0.0,0.8105,0.1895,0.62225,0.045,0.795,0.16,0.9949,11.2005,22.225550000000002,212.0,0.10483750000000001
Israel and the West Bank are on edge again. Here are five things you need to know,2022-04-01,"A series of terror attacks and violent incidents have put Israel and the Palestinian territories on edge again.  In just one week, 11 people were killed in three attacks in Israeli towns and cities. It was the deadliest week Israel had seen in years and follows weeks of rising tensions that saw Israelis targeted in stabbing attacks and several Palestinians shot dead by Israeli forces in the West Bank.  The overlap of three major religious holidays over the next month -- Ramadan, Passover and Easter -- could heighten tensions further, exacerbating a potent mix of factors that could spark yet another cycle of violence. Here are five things you need to know about the recent uptick in violence.  Attacks hit deep in Israel    The lethal attacks took place not in the typical hot spots, disputed areas like Jerusalem or the West Bank, much of which is considered by the international community to be occupied territory. Instead they happened in Israeli towns and cities that are not used to such violence. Unusually, two of the attacks were carried out by Israeli-Arabs. On March 22, an Israeli-Arab killed four Israeli civilians in a stabbing and ramming attack in the southern city of Be'er Sheva, Israeli police said. The attacker had previously been imprisoned for supporting ISIS.  On Sunday, two Israeli-Arab men killed two border police officers and wounded six passersby in the northern city of Hadera, local media reported. The two were also affiliated with ISIS, which claimed responsibility for the incident -- the first such ISIS claim for an attack in Israel since 2017.  Then on Tuesday night, a Palestinian from the West Bank shot and killed five people in Bnei Brak, a mostly Orthodox city just east of Tel Aviv. Two of those killed were Ukrainian citizens, two were Israeli civilians and one was a police officer who responded to the scene, according to Israeli police. In all three cases the attackers were shot and killed by either civilians or security forces. Tensions rising in the West Bank and Jerusalem  Tensions had already been on the rise for weeks, even before the three attacks. There had been several stabbings carried out by Palestinians against Israelis in Jerusalem in March and several Palestinians, including teenagers, had been shot dead by Israeli forces in the West Bank during clashes over the past several weeks.  The security situation is escalating. While many of the recent attacks targeted police or military forces within Jerusalem's Old City, the most recent stabbing targeted an Israeli out for a jog in a popular neighborhood outside the Old City. Two of the three attacks in the past week targeted civilians.  The cycle of violence has continued since then. On Thursday, two Palestinians -- including one teenager -- were killed and 15 others wounded during an Israeli police raid in the West Bank city of Jenin targeting suspects connected to the Bnei Brak shooting. The family home of the attacker has also been scheduled for demolition, Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said, a standard practice by Israeli forces to ""create deterrence"" (the Israeli Army says families can try to appeal demolitions). A few hours later, an Israeli was stabbed on a bus in the West Bank just south of Bethlehem. The attacker, a Palestinian, was shot dead by an armed civilian on the bus, the Israeli military said. And for months, Palestinian and Israeli activists have warned that violence against Palestinians carried out by Israeli setters is at an all-time high. Israel's Defense Minister Benny Gantz has vowed to treat settler violence with a ""heavy hand,"" calling perpetrators ""terrorists"" and promising special military teams that are supposed to help monitor areas where clashes tend to erupt -- although most Palestinians are already wary of the Israeli military, saying they believe they only help protect settlers.  PM calls on civilians to carry firearms as Israel goes on high alert  Israel's security alert status has been raised to its highest level. That means police are much more visible on the streets, working longer shifts and focusing their presence on schools and popular gathering spots.  Troop presence in the West Bank hand around the Gaza strip has also increased, with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announcing they are adding 14 battalions and combat soldiers from special forces units. Soldiers who carry a certain class of weapon will also be required to take their weapons with them even while on leave, Bennett said. Bennett has also made the unusual call to all civilians with a license to carry a firearm to now keep their guns on them at all times, saying Israelis need to be ""alert.""  ""Open your eyes. Whoever has a license to carry a weapon, this is the time to carry it,"" he said in a video statement Wednesday. Palestinian militant groups mobilize Palestinian militant groups have praised the attacks and called for further action, especially in reaction to raids in the West Bank and violence from Jewish settlers.  Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza, said in a statement: ""The continuous crimes of the occupation portend a comprehensive explosion, which will be more powerful and more painful, in which our people will be involved in all parts of our occupied land.""  Abu Hamza, the military spokesman for the Al-Quds Brigades of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, announced ""the raising of full readiness among our fighters in all military formations."" Bennett's government faces a tough test The violence could threaten Bennett's razor thin margin in parliament. The current governing coalition is made up of right, left and center parties including, for the first time ever, an Arab party.  Opposition leader (and former Prime Minister) Benjamin Netanyahu and his supporters have been placing the blame for the wave of violence on the coalition government. Former security officials have called the attacks intelligence failures, especially since some of the attackers in the past week had previously been in prison for terrorist-related support or activity.   As top Israeli journalist Barak Ravid wrote in Axios this week, ""For years, personal security was one of the main issues Israelis voted on. A feeling of insecurity among the public could erode the very narrow base of support the government has.""","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",42,93.0,0.207,0.701,0.092,-0.5574,0.168,0.755,0.078,-0.9989,-23.410800000000002,-13.77405,222.0,-0.06204527027027027
Israel's police under fire amid further allegations of 'Pegasus' cybersurveillance use against public figures,2022-02-07,"Israel's government is set to consider opening a commission of inquiry into the police amid growing anger over the alleged police use of Pegasus hacking software against a wide array of senior public figures.  The development comes after a new report by the business news website Calcalist alleging that phones belonging to, among others, several heads of government ministries, a leading businessman, a co-defendant in the trial of Benjamin Netanyahu, and even one of the former Prime Minister's sons, were infiltrated with Pegasus spyware.   It is the latest report by the website, which is linked to Israel's leading Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper, detailing alleged police use of the NSO Group-made Pegasus software. Like its previous reporting on the story, the website did not provide any information about its sources, nor did it provide any dates when the alleged illegality took place.   Earlier Calcalist reports have focused on the alleged failure to seek authorization for the use of Pegasus but the latest allegations go much further by suggesting widespread surveillance of people under no suspicion of any wrong doing.  ""Calcalist can reveal for the first time a list of dozens of citizens who were targeted by Israel Police, having their phones hacked by NSO spyware and their personal information swiped and filed away. The surveillance was conducted to phish for intelligence even before any investigation had been opened against the targets, and without judicial warrants,"" the article began.  Within hours of the report's publication, Israel's Public Security Minister, who has overall responsibility for the police, announced he was asking Cabinet colleagues to approve the establishment of a government commission of inquiry into the use of spyware and other electronic snooping technologies, ""to investigate in depth the violation of civil rights and their privacy in the years in question.""  Prime Minister Naftali Bennett also commented, saying, ""The reports about Pegasus, if they are true, are very serious. This tool and similar tools, are important tools in the fight against terrorism and severe crime, but they were not intended to be used in phishing campaigns targeting the Israeli public or officials -- which is why we need to understand exactly what happened.""  The allegations pile further pressure on Israel's police forces, which have been under fire since the first Calcalist report last month alleging use of Pegasus. Last week, in a vaguely-worded statement, police admitted that what they called ""additional findings"" from an internal investigation had been passed on to the Attorney General's office, which opened its own investigation into how Israeli police monitors electronic communications.  Speaking on Israeli radio Monday morning, police spokesman Eli Levy insisted that all police actions investigated thus far had been carried out legally.  ""Up to this point, there has been no known wrong-doing in the work of the police. We are transparent and open to any investigation,"" he said. ""If it is found that a police officer or an official wearing a uniform has committed a criminal offense, he will be prosecuted instantly.""  Among those whose phones were allegedly infected with Pegasus is Iris Elovitch, a co-defendant in the corruption trial of former Prime Minister Netanyahu. Lawyer Jack Chen, who is representing Elovitch's husband, Shaul, who is also on trial, said the revelations meant the trial should be suspended.   One of Netanyahu's senior Likud party colleagues, Yisrael Katz, echoed that sentiment on Twitter.  ""In light of what has been exposed in the past few days, and this morning, I demand an immediate freeze of all of the legal proceedings against Binyamin Netanyahu ... A gross attempt was made here to topple an incumbent prime minister through illegal means and there is a grave threat to democracy in the State of Israel,"" Katz tweeted.     Proceedings in the trial, being held at Jerusalem's District Court, continued Monday as planned, though prosecutors were given until 7:00 p.m. to say whether the current witness, Dana Neufeld, a legal advisor at the Communications Ministry during the period in question, was among those under surveillance.

Israeli officials deny report that police are using cellphone spying software on citizens without court approval,2022-01-20,"Israeli officials are denying parts of a report that says they used NSO hacking software Pegasus to spy on civilians -- including leaders of protest movements -- without the required legal permissions. In an article published on Tuesday, business website Calcalist alleged that the NSO Group's Pegasus spyware was used by Israeli police to spy on civilians -- including politicians and leaders of protest movements -- without the required legal permissions. The website did not cite any sources or documents, though the report elicited wide reaction from the government and lawmakers.   Israel's Minister of Public Security Omer Bar-Lev denied that surveillance was done without permission on Tuesday, writing in a tweet, ""Once investigated, there is no practice of wiretapping, or intrusion into devices, by the Israel Police without the approval of a judge.""  Bar-Lev added that he will further investigate and make sure no one is ""cutting corners"" with regard to the use of NSO Group's software. Calcalist, which is part of the same media organization as Israel's leading Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper, reported on Tuesday Israeli police have used the Pegasus technology in the past to remotely hack into the phones of ""mayors, leaders of political protests against former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, former governmental employees, and a person close to a senior politician,"" without the proper court approval. The report did not specifically name any of the alleged targets of the hacking. According to security researchers, Pegasus is capable of remotely infecting mobile phones and eavesdropping on calls or text messages. Such use of technology on Israeli citizens can only be done under court supervision. The Calcalist report says that in the instances it chronicled the surveillance was ordered by ""high-ranking police officers without a court warrant or the supervision of a judge."" In a lengthy statement on Thursday, Israeli Police Commissioner Yaakov Shabtai said that after they first became aware of the Calcalist report, the police began ""a thorough internal investigation"" that ""did not yield any findings that indicate an alleged deviation from the provisions of the law."" Shabtai said authorities would ask the newspaper to provide them with more concrete details on the alleged incidents. He added that police would step up review of the allegations, saying he has ""instructed all relevant parties to continue to deepen the examinations, beyond the examinations that have already been done, of all the actions, also with regard to past years."" ""I assure all citizens of Israel that the police will continue to fulfill its complex and important tasks, and that it will not spare any legal, and only legal, means to thwart a serious crime in the State of Israel,"" Shabtai said. An NSO spokesperson said in a statement that ""we cannot confirm or deny any existing or potential customers. We wish to clarify that the company does not operate the system once (it has been) sold to its governmental customers and it is not involved in any way in the system's operation."" The spokesperson added that NSO licenses its technology to ""prevent terror and crime"" and that its employees are ""not exposed to customers' targets nor are they privy to the collected data, the ongoing operations or any other investigations by its customers."" Israeli lawmakers from across the political spectrum condemned the report and called for investigations. Minister of Energy Karine Elharrar, a member of the center-left Yesh Atid party, told Israeli Army Radio that the allegations in the report are ""something that a democratic country cannot allow.""  Member of Parliament Moshe Arbel from the Ultra-Orthodox Shas party told Army Radio ""there is no coalition and opposition. If even half of this report is true, it's a national tragedy."" On Thursday morning, Minister of the Environmental Protection Tamar Zandberg of the left wing Meretz party, told the 103FM radio station she wants a state-level commission into the allegations. Cybersecurity researchers have documented years of alleged abuse of NSO Group's spyware by governments. The spyware has allegedly been found on the phones of journalists and human rights workers from Mexico to Morocco. The sale of such technology to foreign countries must be approved by Israel's Ministry of Defense. In July, after more reports of the Pegasus software being used by governments to spy on journalist, business executives and human rights activists, Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz said they took the claims seriously and appointed an interministerial team to look into the current process and whether Israeli-made technology was being misused abroad. Apple and Facebook have sued NSO Group for allegedly violating a US anti-hacking law, allegations that the NSO Group denies. In November, the US Commerce Department blacklisted the NSO Group and another spyware firm, Candiru, accusing the companies of providing spyware to foreign governments that ""used these tools to maliciously target"" journalists, embassy workers and activists.","{'neg': 0.261, 'neu': 0.739, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.6065}",28,95.0,0.03,0.921,0.049,0.296,0.069,0.877,0.054,-0.9007,8.288,-6.053400000000002,169.0,-0.03581893491124261
"Netanyahu negotiating possible corruption case plea deal to safeguard political career, sources say",2022-01-18,"For years, former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called his ongoing corruption trial a ""witch hunt"" and an ""attempted coup.""  Although his denunciations of the case echoed words often heard from his once-close ally Donald Trump, Netanyahu is now deviating from the former US president's methods.    Netanyahu and his team have been discussing a possible plea deal with prosecutors in his corruption case, two sources close to the matter tell CNN.   The negotiations, if fruitful, could be finalized in the next few weeks, according to the sources, and would bring a surprising end to a years-long drama. Depending on the details of any eventual plea deal sentence, Netanyahu could be giving up politics for the next seven years.    Here's what you need to know. The charges   Netanyahu faces charges in three separate cases.   In Case 1000, he is charged with fraud and breach of trust in connection with allegations that he received gifts like cigars and champagne from overseas businessmen.   In Case 2000, he is also charged with fraud and breach of trust and is accused of seeking favorable coverage in one of Israel's top newspapers in exchange for limiting the circulation of one of the paper's main rivals.    In the most serious case, Case 4000, he is charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust for allegedly advancing regulatory benefits worth the equivalent of more than $250 million at the time to his friend Shaul Elovitch, who was the controlling shareholder for the telecommunications company Bezeq. In return, the prosecution says, Elovitch ensured positive coverage of the Prime Minister in an online news site he owned called Walla! News. Elovitch has denied the charges.   The trial began in May of 2020 at the Jerusalem District Court and is in the midst of hearing from witnesses for the prosecution.  Moral turpitude   The possible plea deal would likely see the most serious charge of bribery dropped altogether, another charge of fraud and breach of trust watered down (in Case 1000), and one of the three cases completely shelved (Case 2000), according to information provided by the sources who are close to the negotiations.   But the sources say that a key point of disagreement is over the length of community service Netanyahu would receive for pleading guilty to the remaining charges, and whether that sentence carries with it the stain of moral turpitude.    If the sentence is longer than three months, then prosecutors can insist on the inclusion of moral turpitude, which would bar the 72-year-old Netanyahu from politics for seven years according to Israeli law.  Even if prosecutors choose not to include the moral turpitude label, a future election commission judge could still decide Netanyahu's convictions and sentence barred him from politics for the same seven-year period.   It is different if the sentence is shorter than three months. In this situation there is a loophole according to Israeli law. If Netanyahu faces his sentence as a private citizen, which he could ensure by resigning his seat in parliament, the issue of moral turpitude would not be considered.   Why now? Word of the possible plea deal comes just weeks before Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit is set to end his term on January 31.   Mandelblit was responsible for issuing the indictments against Netanyahu, following lengthy police investigations, and is largely seen as wanting to end his time in office with a successful conviction.  The next attorney general will be appointed by the new government, led by Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, and may be much less likely to offer such a plea deal to Netanyahu.  But critics -- including hundreds of protesters who gathered outside of Mandelblit's home on Saturday night -- are pushing back against the deal. For them, anything less than a full a trial and sentence carrying with it the label of moral turpitude would be regarded as a failure, given the seriousness of pursuing cases against a serving prime minister.   Political reverberations While at first glance it may seem like Netanyahu's political opponents would be happy to see him take a plea deal in disgrace and leave the political arena, some Israeli analysts say such a move could shake the stability of the current government.   The new government, lead by former Netanyahu chief of staff Bennett, is a hodgepodge of political parties ranging from far-right parties like Bennett's, to the left. It also includes the first Arab party to sit in government in Israel.   The glue that has bound those parties reflects a shared wish to end Netanyahu's time as Israel's longest serving prime minister. And for as long as he has remained in front line politics -- as the leader of the opposition -- it has held together well.    But if he were to exit the stage, it could provide an opening for a new coalition, made-up entirely of right-wing and religious parties, that could topple the current unity government.

"Israel announces plan to double Golan Heights population, drawing condemnation from Syria",2021-12-28,"Israel said on Sunday that it intends to double the population of the contested area of the Golan Heights in the coming years, drawing the ire of the Syrian government.  Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett made the announcement at a special Cabinet meeting held in the Golan Heights on Sunday. He said they will invest 1 billion shekels (about $320 million) to make the area a ""place that is good to live in,"" including building thousands of new homes and establishing two new settlements, according to a translation of his comments posted to the official Facebook page of the Israeli Prime Minister. ""I would like to be clear: after many static years regarding the scope of community life, our goal today is to double the population of the Golan Heights,"" Bennett said. ""To this end, we will establish two new communities on the Golan Heights, Asif and Matar. We are increasing community life here,"" he added.  The Golan Heights are considered occupied territory under international law and UN Security Council resolutions. Israel seized the narrow strip of land from Syria in 1967 during the Six-Day War and annexed the land in 1981. There are approximately 53,000 people living in the Golan Heights, split almost evenly between Israeli settlers and Syrian Druze, as well as a small population of Alawites. In March 2019, then-US President Donald Trump overturned longstanding US policy regarding the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, announcing ""it is time"" for the United States to ""fully recognize Israel's Sovereignty"" over the region.  Afterwards, then-Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government established the new settlement of Trump Heights, but the plans amounted to little more than a sign for tourists.  On Sunday, Bennett said that of the 1 billion shekels (NIS) to be invested in the area, ""NIS 500 million is for planning and housing. NIS 162 million is for regional development -- tourism, industry, commerce, everything that creates good jobs here. Another NIS 160 million will be for improving the quality of life -- transportation, medical care and other aspects of life."" The cabinet unanimously approved the plan, Israeli media reported. After the meeting, Ahmad Tibi, senior member of the opposition Arab Joint List, said ""it doesn't matter how many Cabinet meetings are held on the Golan, it is occupied Syrian territory. All parts of the coalition are responsible for the decisions made during this Cabinet meeting, as well as for the deepening of the settlements and the violence of settlers,"" according to AI Monitor. The Syrian government on Monday vociferously condemned Israel's announcement, according to Syria's state-run news agency, SANA.   ""The Syrian government reaffirms its permanent and strong support for its Syrian citizens, the people of the occupied Syrian Golan who resist the Israeli occupation and who reject the annexation decision and the policy of seizing lands by force,"" a statement from Syria's Foreign Ministry said, according to SANA.

Trump uses anti-Semitic tropes to again criticize Jewish Americans,2021-12-17,"Former President Donald Trump, in a newly released interview, claimed that Jewish Americans ""either don't like Israel or don't care about Israel,"" while also suggesting that evangelical Christians ""love Israel more than the Jews in this country."" Trump's comments are the latest in a series of controversial remarks he has been known to make about Jewish Americans. During his first campaign for president, Trump delivered a speech to the Republican Jewish Coalition that was rife with anti-Semitic stereotypes. More recently, he told conservative radio host Ari Hoffman that ""Israel literally owned Congress...10 years ago, 15 years ago... and today it's almost the opposite."" Speaking to Israeli journalist Barak Ravid, during a sit-down interview earlier this year, parts of which aired Friday on the podcast ""Unholy: Two Jews on the News,"" the former President said, ""It's a very dangerous thing that's happening,"" as he claimed that Jewish Americans have turned their back on Israel.  ""There's people in this country that are Jewish and no longer love Israel,"" Trump said. ""I'll tell you, the evangelical Christians love Israel more than the Jews in this country."" Trump outperformed both of his Democratic rivals -- Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden -- with White evangelical voters in 2016 and 2020 and is currently considering a third run for president in 2024. Speaking to Ravid, Trump blamed Biden and former President Barack Obama for what he perceives as Israel's waning influence over US elected officials. ""It used to be that Israel had absolute power over Congress, and today I think it's the exact opposite. And I think Obama and Biden did that,"" Trump charged. ""And yet in the election, they still get a lot of votes from the Jewish people. Which tells you that the Jewish people, and I've said this for a long time, the Jewish people in the United States either don't like Israel or don't care about Israel."" In the same interview, Trump suggested that The New York Times ""hates Israel"" even though ""they're Jewish people that run The New York Times."" (For decades, the paper has been owned by the Sulzberger family, though its employees, including its top editors, come from all backgrounds). A spokesman for Trump could not immediately be reached for comment. Ravid was among several journalists who interviewed the former President at his Mar-a-Lago and Bedminster clubs shortly after he left office in January. During his interviews with Ravid, the former President also said he hasn't spoken with former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu since he congratulated Biden on his 2020 victory last November. ""F**k him,"" Trump said of Netanyahu, according to a report by Axios. ""The first person that congratulated [Biden] was Bibi Netanyahu, the man that I did more for than any other person I dealt with ... Bibi could have stayed quiet. He has made a terrible mistake,"" Trump reportedly said.","{'neg': 0.245, 'neu': 0.755, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.3818}",20,98.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.059,0.905,0.035,-0.7824,0.0,5.75343333333333,119.0,0.048348179271708654
Trump accuses Netanyahu of disloyalty for congratulating Biden after 2020 win: 'F**k him',2021-12-10,"Former President Donald Trump railed against his one-time close ally Benjamin Netanyahu in a new interview series, saying he felt betrayed by the then-prime minister of Israel's video message to Joe Biden congratulating him on winning the presidency.  ""It was early. OK? Let's put it this way -- he greeted him very early. Earlier than most world leaders. I've not spoken to him since. F**k him,"" Trump told Israeli journalist Barak Ravid during an April interview which was published by Axios Friday. Discussing his decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel -- upending decades of US policy and international consensus -- as well as recognizing Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights, captured from Syria during a war in 1967, Trump laid out why he felt so embittered.  ""There was no one who did more for Netanyahu than me. There was no one who did for Israel more than I did. And the first person to run to greet Joe Biden was Netanyahu. And not only did he congratulate him -- he did it in a video. If you look at the leaders of other countries -- like Brazil -- he waited months. Putin. Many other leaders. Mexico. All of them also felt that the election was over. But they, too, were waiting. No one did more than me for Bibi. Money too. We gave them a lot of money and gave them soldiers. We did everything.""  Netanyahu did post his congratulations on Twitter and in a video on November 8, 2020, the day after the race had been called in Biden's favor. Netanyahu said in that post he and Biden have had a ""long & warm"" personal relationship for almost 40 years and sees him as ""a great friend of Israel"" and looks forward to working together. In a separate Twitter post, Netanyahu thanked Trump ""for the friendship you have shown the state of Israel and me personally, for recognizing Jerusalem and the Golan, for standing up to Iran, for the historic peace accords and for bringing the American-Israeli alliance to unprecedented heights."" Despite posting his congratulations online, Netanyahu was slow to call Biden after the election, waiting two weeks to call the President-elect, which drew criticism from some in Israel.  Ravid spoke to the former President twice in 2021 as part of research into a new book about the Abraham Accords, which will be published Sunday. The quotes from the interview appear in Friday's addition of Israel's best-selling daily Yedioth Ahronoth, as well as the US-based news website Axios.  This story has been updated to correct that Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated Joe Biden in a video message.","{'neg': 0.14, 'neu': 0.64, 'pos': 0.221, 'compound': 0.34}",29,99.0,0.057875,0.8305,0.11149999999999999,0.23024285714285714,0.034,0.852,0.114,0.9904,6.677042857142857,19.48157619047619,127.0,0.15339823772028496
A single sentence that perfectly captures the utter madness of the Trump era,2021-12-10,"In an interview with Donald Trump earlier this week, conservative talk radio host Hugh Hewitt said something truly breathtaking. ""You know, Mr. President, you and I disagree about the election, but we agree on so much,"" Hewitt told Trump, segueing into a conversation about China's hypersonic missiles. Talk about an other-than-that-how-was-the-play-Mrs. Lincoln moment! That Hewitt uttered that line without irony is a telling window into how conservatives have found ways to rationalize Trump and his fundamentally anti-democratic attempts to undermine the faith of the American public in the 2020 election results. Here's the reality: You can't just sort of yada yada the election rejection embraced by Trump. Because in refusing to accept the result of the 2020 election and repeatedly (and falsely) alleging voter fraud, Trump is actively working against everything that makes America, well, America.   Hewitt's attempt to dismiss his disagreement with Trump over the election then as just another policy disagreement is laughable. This isn't Hewitt saying we should have stayed in Afghanistan and Trump saying we should have pulled American troops out. This is the former President of the United States refusing to accept the results of a national election.  And, it's actually more than that. It's that Trump has turned election denialism into a litmus test for aspiring Republican candidates. If you aren't willing to say you believe -- contra all available evidence -- that the 2020 election was stolen, then you not only won't have Trump's support but may well find him actively working to defeat you when you run for reelection. (See Brian Kemp and David Perdue in Georgia. Also Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel.) Trump is working to make a belief that the 2020 election was stolen a central piece of the Republican Party platform. And, again, this isn't like making abortion or trade a party platform. This is making a rejection of American democracy a major part of what it means to be a Republican. Because of all of that, Hewitt can't simply write what Trump is doing as a place where they disagree. That sort of justification is how we got into this mess, with one of the two major political parties in the country devolving more into a cult of personality than any sort of organization gathered together by a shared set of principles and policies. Refusing to believe in the results of a free and fair election have to be disqualifying for any party leader. It's non-negotiable. If we can't agree that the election was fair -- even if our preferred candidate lost -- then we have sacrificed the thing that makes America great. That Hewitt  -- and his fellow conservatives who continue to bend over backward to placate Trump -- can't (or won't) see that suggests just how lost the conservative movement is at the moment.","{'neg': 0.167, 'neu': 0.517, 'pos': 0.316, 'compound': 0.3818}",23,100.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.123,0.746,0.131,-0.086,0.0,11.19357619047619,122.0,0.09175062451209992
Don't count on an end to the Joe Biden-Naftali Bennett honeymoon -- yet,2021-11-08,"Is the Joe Biden-Naftali Bennett honeymoon over? It would seem so. Everywhere one looks these days there appears to be disagreement and division between Washington and Jerusalem. Noisy tensions appear to be brewing over any number of issues including settlements, the currently closed Jerusalem consulate and Israel designating six human rights organizations as terror groups. But look closer, and a more complex dynamic is visible. The Bennett government -- at least its right-wing elements -- seems persuaded that Biden is too busy; too worried about right-wing former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's potential return, should the Bennett-led coalition collapse; and too fearful of domestic fallout, which always hangs over a US president feuding with Israel, to really get tough with Israel on any of these matters.  And there's a very good chance the Israelis are reading Biden's priorities correctly. Indeed, the one issue on which they don't appear to be spatting -- at least publicly -- is Iran. For Biden, the Palestinian issue isn't ready for prime time, and the Iran nuclear issue could be headed for prime trouble.  Maintaining close ties with Israel, even if it means sacrificing America's already shredded credibility on the Palestinian issue, is good politics and smart policy.  Few might have predicted in June, when the Bennett government was first sworn in, that there would be a spate of issues piling up that could sow discord between the two allies. Sure, Bennett took office as a right-wing Prime Minister who could easily have fit in a Likud government. But the current coalition had left and centrist elements too, to keep him in check. Despite his politics, Bennett carried less US-related baggage than Netanyahu, who had alienated Democrats with overtures to Republicans. And besides, all in Bennett's coalition have had a common interest in avoiding contentious issues like the Palestinian problem that, were they to rise to the forefront and spark division among Israel's fragile ruling order, might cause the government to collapse and bring Netanyahu back into power.  Evidently, that was Biden's calculation, too. The US President called Bennett to congratulate him within hours of the new Israeli government's swearing-in. Indeed, Bennett was the only world leader to visit Washington during Biden's Afghan withdrawal crisis in August. If anything, it seemed the two leaders had agreed to a close bond with one another. Biden referred to an ""unshakable partnership"" during their White House meeting. Biden seems to have banked on Bennett being constrained from taking steps that might embarrass him; too worried about his own government's potential collapse; and too smart and too weak, in his domestic-political standing, to push the US into a corner. And Bennett seemed to believe Biden was too focused on his own domestic concerns to bother much with the Palestinian issue, let alone pick a fight with Israel. Over the past few months, however, the Israelis have pushed the envelope -- and seem to have forgotten their side of the bargain. Seemingly under pressure from his own base and from his right-wing partners, Bennett and his government have taken several actions that have drawn hard looks and responses from the Biden administration.  First, a large number of settlement housing units has been approved -- the first by the new Israeli government  -- many deep in the West Bank. That drew a harsh response from the Biden administration. Indeed, the projects were approved despite a warning from US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Minister of Defense Benny Gantz. At the same time, Israel appears to be advancing plans for construction of other long-planned housing projects  -- Givat Hamatos and E-1 -- that if completed would virtually divide Jerusalem from the West Bank and further bury already distant hopes for a two-state solution. Second, a battle appears to be looming over the reopening of the US consulate in East Jerusalem, through which Washington formerly liaised directly with the Palestinians, and which Biden pledged to reopen after Trump had closed it in 2019.  Originally seen by the US administration as a low-cost way of restoring the pre-Trump status quo and strengthening ties with the Palestinians, the issue has become hot and volatile, as the Israeli right wing views it as a Trojan horse designed to divide Jerusalem. Others worry it could trigger the collapse of Bennett's government. Not surprisingly, Republicans in Congress have jumped on the issue with legislation designed to prevent the Biden administration from acting and by painting Biden as appeasing the Palestinians and dividing Jerusalem. The Bennett government isn't sleepwalking into a potential crisis. It seems to have made a judgment that the Biden administration has no stomach for a fight. That may well be a safe bet.  On settlements, the US administration has confined its reaction to tough words, but no action. On the consulate, the administration had already promised to delay reopening it until after the Israeli budget passes; the latest thinking conveyed to Israeli Foreign Minister Lapid by Secretary of State Blinken was to appoint a small working group to work out a solution -- a sure sign that what's in store is more delay.  Not pushing harder on settlements and the consulate will undermine the administration's credibility and will disappoint those who expected Biden to reverse his predecessor's policies, particularly toward the Palestinians. But governing is about choosing. And in the greater scheme of things, the Biden administration has all but written off the Palestinian issue as a low priority -- not ready for prime time and not worth the investment of badly needed political capital, especially when the administration is struggling at home.  The trouncing Democrats took this past Tuesday -- when Republicans swept statewide elections in Virginia and showed better than expected in New Jersey's governor race -- has only deepened the importance of husbanding limited political capital and reducing the Biden administration's exposure.  Indeed, the last thing Biden wants or needs now is a fight with Israelis, Republicans and maybe even a few Democrats over Jerusalem. Instead, with the nuclear negotiations with Iran set to resume on November 29, Biden should keep his powder dry in the event those negotiations make progress and he encounters real pushback from Israel and those in Congress who oppose returning to the old nuclear deal without correcting its deficiencies.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",42,101.0,0.126,0.8250000000000001,0.04866666666666667,-0.6870499999999999,0.128,0.773,0.098,-0.9885,-28.856099999999998,-22.17905714285714,132.0,-0.16802316017316016
"Israel doubles down against US, saying there is no room in Jerusalem for an American Consulate for Palestinians",2021-11-07,"Sitting next to the Israeli Foreign Minister in Washington this October, Secretary of State Antony Blinken was clear: The Americans want to re-open their consulate in Jerusalem to serve Palestinians.  ""We'll be moving forward with the process of opening a consulate as part of deepening of those ties with the Palestinians,"" Blinken said at the State Department.  Less than a month later, Israel's political leadership was also clear: it has no plans to approve such a consulate (the host country must approve any new foreign consulate).  Asked by CNN at a press conference Saturday evening about US intentions, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said his government had presented its opinion to the Americans ""clearly and openly.""   ""There is no room for another American consulate in Jerusalem. We always present our position quietly without drama and we expect it to be understood. Jerusalem is the capital of one state and that's the state of Israel,"" Bennett said, standing alongside Foreign Minister Yair Lapid and Finance Minister Avigdor Liberman. ""I'm sure our American friends and us will continue to collaborate on a long list of big things.""   Lapid, who sat next to Blinken as he made those comments in Washington last month, echoed Bennett's sentiments, adding that if the Americans want to open a consulate for Palestinians in Ramallah, they would be welcome to do so.     ""As for the (US) consulate, as we both said it is not about politics and political stability. It is the State of Israel refusing in principle that a consulate be opened in Jerusalem,"" Lapid said.  Former President Donald Trump folded the consulate in 2019, merging it into the new American embassy in Jerusalem after moving it from Tel Aviv when the United States recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital. For many Palestinians, an American consulate in Jerusalem is a precursor to what they hope will one day be an American Embassy in East Jerusalem, capital of a potential future state of Palestine.  The Americans have been seen as largely holding off from major confrontations with Israel over issues like the consulate or the expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank, as a way to help shore up the stability of the coalition government. Stitched together from a diverse group of eight parties representing a broad spectrum of ideologies, the government came to power in June agreeing on few subjects except a desire to oust former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after 12 years in power.  Passing a new state budget at the end of last week -- which had not been accomplished since 2018 leading to Israel's record four elections in two years -- puts the government on much more stable ground (because failure to do so by November 14 would have triggered new elections). Now some world partners, including European diplomats like Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney, have made it clear that with the new government now looking more secure, it is time to start pushing Israel harder on issues related to the Palestinians.   ""I think that both the EU and the US quite frankly have been cautious in terms of any criticism of this new Israeli government because it is a fragile government,"" Coveney told CNN's Becky Anderson on Thursday.  But with the budget passed, and Israel's government looking set, ""both Washington as well as the European Union needs to now focus on their relationship with this new Israeli government, and make it very clear to them that if we are serious about delivering a peace process together, well, then expanding settlements not only is illegal, but it is also unacceptable to the international community,"" he added.  Hussein Al Sheikh, the Palestinian Authority's head of Civil Affairs, said in a tweet on Sunday that Bennett's statements about the consulate in Jerusalem represent a ""challenge from the Israeli government to the #Biden administration,"" seeing as it had ""already announced repeatedly its decision to open the US Consulate in East Jerusalem!!!""   While the new Israeli government's mantra in its relations with the United States has been ""no drama,"" especially when it comes to a possible return to the Iran nuclear deal, the Biden administration has openly criticized the Israeli government recently over issues related to the Palestinians. A recent announcement by Israel to green light thousands of new Israeli housing units in the West Bank, was criticized by the State Department, whose spokesperson Ned Price called it ""completely inconsistent with efforts to lower tensions and to ensure calm.""  Israel's move to label six Palestinian NGOs as terrorist organizations, accusing them of working with the designated terrorist group Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, also drew some sharp words from the Europeans and Americans.  ""We believe respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms, and a strong civil society are critically important for responsible and responsive governance,"" State Department spokesperson Ned Price said at the time.  But when asked on Saturday if his government was headed toward a confrontation and increased tensions with the Americans, now that the budget had passed, Bennett simply said, ""No.""  ""There is so much more we agree upon with American friends that we disagree upon,"" the Prime Minister said, adding "" I am sure our American friends and us will continue to collaborate on a long list of big things.""

Trump's inner circle takes a trip down memory lane in Jerusalem,2021-10-12,"For a few short hours in Jerusalem this week, the Trump band got back together for a glitzy reunion gig. ""There goes the royal family,"" one attendee quipped as Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner were inundated with hellos and selfie requests. At the brand-new Museum of Tolerance, highlights from the signing of the Abraham Accords played as the former President's daughter and son-in-law, former Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other Trump administration alumni mingled with the rich and powerful over ceviche, steaks, and plenty of drinks.  Huge, black-fringed table lamps towered over the curious selection of guests -- including NFL star Peyton Manning and FIFA President Gianni Infantino -- at one of several open bars.   The whole event had an ""Alice in Wonderland"" feel, as if those present had tumbled through the looking glass and into an alternate reality where Donald Trump was still President of the United States and Benjamin Netanyahu was still Prime Minister of Israel.  In theory, this was a launch party for the Friedman Center for Peace Through Strength, an organization founded by the former US Ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, which seeks to advance the Abraham Accords -- the September 2020 deal, brokered by the US, to normalize relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco. In practice, it felt like a Trump reunion, and a campaign event for Pompeo, who received an award recognizing his work on the Abraham Accords, while assiduously avoiding reporters.  Many attendees wished out loud that Pompeo would run for US President in 2024 -- something he is reportedly considering, if Trump doesn't run again.  ""We need to order the Pompeo wine!"" said a diplomat's wife at the bar, on learning that some of the drinks on offer were from the Psagot winery, located in an Israeli settlement in the West Bank that named one of its reds after Pompeo last year.  Others were even more explicit.  ""Time ran out on the Trump administration, and we saw some of your achievements backslide, but hopefully President Pompeo will continue that path,"" billionaire philanthropist Sylvan Adams, a co-chair of the event, said -- to huge applause -- before adding that he thought Pompeo and the Abraham Accords architects would have been a ""much more deserving"" winner of this year's Nobel Peace Prize. The US and Israel's current leaders, President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, may as well not have existed. Just one serving member of the Israeli cabinet -- Interior Minister Ayelet Shaked -- appeared to be in attendance.  In a brief interview with CNN at the event, Friedman said he had stayed in close touch with the Trump administration alumni who flew out for the event and that it hadn't been difficult to get them to make the long journey to Israel. Kushner and Trump arrived at 4am on Monday and left the same evening.  ""I love all these people: Jared, Ivanka, Mnuchin, Pompeo; We worked very closely together, we really liked each other -- which is unusual, by the way, for administrations in politics -- and it's just good to see everyone here in Jerusalem,"" he said.  Earlier in the day at the Israeli parliament Kushner, Trump, Netanyahu and others had attended the launch of the Abraham Accord caucus. The caucus, made up of more than 100 members of parliament, aims to work on measures that expand the Abraham Accords. And while the evening's festivities appeared to be a toast to the Trump administration, the Knesset event had the feel of a Netanyahu campaign rally.  Almost every time the former Israeli PM's name was mentioned, parts of the audience broke out into applause. The same could not be said whenever Biden or Bennett's names came up.  When Netanyahu arrived -- halfway through the event -- with wife Sara in tow, about a quarter of the audience gave a standing ovation, despite the fact that Morocco's Ambassador to Israel was mid-speech at the time.  During his own address Netanyahu feted himself, quoting passages from his book and old speeches that he said perfectly laid out how peace with Arab nations could be achieved.  Hailing the work carried out by the Trump administration to get such deals done, Netanyahu said he believed he and Kushner, along with the rest of Trump's team, had ""changed history.""  Just a few hours later Netanyahu, who appears to have taken a page out of the former president's playbook on how to treat your successor, lambasted Bennett from the Knesset stage, saying he was ""not a real prime minister.""  For both Netanyahu and the Trump crew, this was a day spent relishing past glories, looking back to what had been and forward -- perhaps -- to what might come again.

"'Isolated' but defiant, Brazil's Bolsonaro defends handling of Covid and climate at UN",2021-09-21,"With Covid-19 and the environment at the top of the agenda at this year's United Nations' General Assembly, observers braced for the first world leader to speak in the UN headquarters' storied hall: Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro, notorious for both his off-the-cuff comments and controversial handling of the pandemic and the environment. The Brazilian President's speech was calmly given, even monotone at times, opening with a numbing sales pitch of his country to investors that touted developments in sanitation and transportation services. He was presenting ""a new Brazil whose credibility has been recovered in the world"" -- one very different from the country devastated by the coronavirus on his watch and lashed by fires in the Amazon, where Bolsonaro has pushed for development. The conservative populist leader stuck to established provocations on social and pandemic issues, repeatedly alluding to the importance of ""the traditional nuclear family"" and criticizing pandemic lockdown measures. Doctors should be free to prescribe the use of ""off-label"" medications against Covid-19, added the president, who has long championed the unproven malaria medicine hydroxychloroquine as a treatment. Brazil traditionally goes first in the General Assembly's weeklong roster of speeches by member states, and Bolsonaro, who is up for reelection next year, had already set a pugnacious tone for his appearance, publicly flouting the UN's ""honor system"" that calls for foreign delegations to be vaccinated before entering the building. Bolsonaro declared last week that he would not get vaccinated, because he already had Covid-19. ""Why do you take a vaccine? To have antibodies, right? My antibodies rate is really high. I can show you the document,"" he said in a live social media broadcast. He added that he will only make a decision about getting vaccinated ""after everyone in Brazil gets the vaccine"" -- a dissonant voice as the General Assembly pushes this year to increase vaccination throughout the globe, and cajoling wealthier nations to share more doses with poorer ones. But while the Brazilian President has tended to use appearances at the UN to reject foreign authority -- showing a similar allergy to being told what to do when it comes to another globe-spanning crisis: global warming -- he seemed to sidestep any direct confrontation on that front.  In 2020 at the UNGA podium, as flames raged in the Amazon, he told the hand-wringing world to back off, claiming foreign agents were overhyping the wildfires in ""the most brutal misinformation campaign."" He has long painted the environmental concerns expressed by foreign governments, local indigenous groups, and organizations as prelude to an imagined foreign invasion of the Amazon.  This year, a quieter Bolsonaro acknowledged ""environmental challenges"" but boasted that the Amazon region had seen a drop of 32% deforestation in August compared to the prior year, citing numbers from the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research indicating 918 square kilometers of deforestation. The number is still nearly double what was registered in August 2018, before the Bolsonaro administration, however.  In contrast, data from the Amazon Institute of Man and Environment (Imazon) -- which monitors the deforested areas by satellite -- suggest 1,606 square kilometers of deforestation in August, a 7% rise in comparison to the same month last year. It is also the highest rate for August in a decade, according to Imazon´s satellites imagery.   The president also called on other countries to do their part by fulfilling commitments to climate funding ""at substantial amounts."" His own government has previously received significant foreign aid from other countries to help halt deforestation -- a tactic that some environmental advocates in Brazil criticize, pointing out that not all the money allocated for environmental work in Brazil is spent in the first place. Bolsonaro, never a fan of pandemic restrictions, acknowledged as much in Tuesday's speech before world leaders, saying that while he regrets ""all of the deaths that took place in Brazil and worldwide,"" the toll of unemployment must be balanced against that of the coronavirus. Over the past year, he had frequently raged against municipal and state-level lockdown orders in Brazil, even during the grimmest moments of the pandemic, when hospitals filled to capacity and whole cities ran out of oxygen. Over half a million Brazilians have died in the pandemic -- the highest death toll in the world after the United States. A more moderate tone had been expected from Bolsonaro this year, said Brian Winter, editor-in-chief of Americas Quarterly and vice president for policy at Americas Society/Council of the Americas. For one thing, the assembly's mood was simply different, with fewer fellow right-wing populist leaders to join Bolsonaro in giving international busybodies the middle finger.  ""Bolsonaro is more isolated than ever,"" Winter told CNN. ""Trump left, Netanyahu is gone. The main country that really aligns with his brand of right-wing conservatism is Victor Orban's Hungary,"" he says. (Bolsonaro did have a sit-down scheduled with Poland's conservative, anti-LGBTQ president Andrzej Duda before he took the stage Tuesday, though.) This year, too, the stakes of climate change have never been clearer, with catastrophic fires and floods seen around the world. Brazil's vast forest works as an ""air conditioner"" for the globe, influencing global temperature and rainfall patterns, and absorbing carbon dioxide, and Winters says Bolsonaro had already previewed a new ""constructive"" tone on coordinating climate protection during a summit convened by US President Joe Biden this spring, when Bolsonaro presented a plan to eliminate illegal deforestation by 2030 and neutralize greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. In a meeting Monday with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Bolsonaro showed the same mild-mannered stubbornness that he later displayed at the podium. The two leaders discussed climate and Covid-19, and Bolsonaro ""affirmed Brazil's commitment to sustainable development,"" a Brazilian Foreign Ministry statement read after the meeting.  But when it came to getting vaccinated per the United Nations' request, he was as unmoving as ever.  During footage of the meeting at the UN headquarters, Johnson could be heard telling Bolsonaro, ""AstraZeneca, it's a great vaccine. Get the AstraZeneca vaccine. I had it twice."" Bolsonaro laughed the tip off. ""No, not yet,"" he said.","{'neg': 0.164, 'neu': 0.836, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.3291}",39,104.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.08,0.855,0.064,-0.982,0.0,7.436600000000003,157.0,0.04736687898089174
"Israel's new plan is to 'shrink,' not solve, the Palestinian conflict. Here's what that looks like",2021-09-16,"The new Israeli government that toppled long-serving Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this summer is full of contradictions. There's pro-peace leftists, pro-settlement right-wingers, pragmatic centrists and even for the first time an Arab Islamist party, all sitting together in one governing coalition. On the most divisive issue -- the Israeli-Palestinian conflict -- there is almost no consensus, which is just how Micah Goodman likes it. Goodman, a political philosopher, has rocketed to public prominence in Israel and beyond for his contrarian thesis on how not to solve the long-running conflict. Many have taken to calling him the court philosopher of Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, an ultra-nationalist former settlement leader, who has publicly embraced Goodman's paradigm of ""shrinking the conflict."" But other centrist and leftist ministers have also come calling. Even the Biden administration has seemingly taken on what Goodman calls his pragmatic and less ideological approach. While the White House remains committed to a two-state solution, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in May that the immediate priority was to ""rebuild some trust"" between Israelis and Palestinians.  Goodman himself is bemused by all the newfound interest from politicians, diplomats and generals. Earlier in his career he wrote books analyzing ancient Jewish texts, which he says was exactly the right training for tackling an issue as contentious as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. ""The foundational idea of the Talmud is to always listen to two sides of the argument,"" Goodman tells CNN. ""The Talmud admires people who ask 'why are we wrong?' Thinking only one side, or only your side, is correct is anti-intellectual."" Goodman deployed this approach in his 2017 book, ""Catch-67: The Left, the Right, and the Legacy of the Six-Day War,"" which wrestled with the internal Israeli debate about the conflict with the Palestinians and the fate of the territory Israel captured during the 1967 war. ""I showed both sides' argument, just like in the Talmud: If Israel stays in the territories [like the right wants] it threatens its future as a Jewish and democratic state. If it leaves the territories [like the left wants] it threatens its future due to security concerns."" The book, Goodman says, ""caught fire,"" becoming a surprise bestseller in Israel that was quickly translated into English. In Goodman's telling, the older approaches by the Israeli left and right only put forward ideologically pure ideas about how to end the conflict with the Palestinians. This is a ""false dichotomy,"" he adds, that led to paralysis and the perpetuation of the status quo in the occupied West Bank. According to Goodman -- who himself lives in a West Bank settlement, although he describes that as irrelevant to his work -- the left wants an immediate end to the military occupation of the territory, while the right wants to continue Israeli settlement construction and the simple ""management"" of the conflict in perpetuity. ""We can make things much better [in the West Bank] even if it doesn't end the conflict,"" Goodman said -- hence ""shrinking"" the conflict. Goodman focuses solely on the West Bank in his analysis and leaves out the thornier issue of the Gaza Strip, which Israel unilaterally withdrew from in 2005 -- and has fought four wars since against the Hamas militant group that controls it. ""It's a much more complicated situation there,"" he said sadly. ""We need to quantify the conflict and decrease the quantity of the conflict -- this is the paradigm shift,"" Goodman adds. ""Look at the Covid-19 pandemic: We're no longer talking about 'Zero Covid,' we're talking about a certain level of Covid, of 'shrinking Covid' so it doesn't collapse the health system."" In practical terms, Goodman's approach entails a host of steps Israel can take to improve Palestinian economic life, security and self-governance in the West Bank. They range from more conservative moves -- such as increasing Palestinian work permits inside Israel and improving Palestinian trade access or building roads and bridges that bolster the territorial contiguity between Palestinian cities -- to more domestically controversial measures, such as freezing settlement building outside of the main Israeli West Bank population centers and granting Palestinians more land for their own construction. In recent weeks, Israel has begun adopting some of these measures, including issuing 15,000 new work permits inside Israel for Palestinians, floating the Palestinian Authority a $500 million loan, re-establishing Joint Economic Committees to discuss future projects, allowing reunification (i.e. legal status) for Palestinian spouses in the West Bank, and tentatively approving 2,000 new housing units for Palestinians in the part of the West Bank under full Israeli control.  As one senior Israeli official told CNN last week, echoing Goodman: ""We have to make every effort to shrink the conflict and start shaping the solution, beginning with infrastructure and economics."" Yet the more far-reaching measures outlined above are extremely unlikely given the make-up of the current Israeli coalition. This doesn't deter Goodman, however -- in his mind it only bolsters his thesis. ""There is no consensus in the government about the end game, but they can agree about the game. This is this government's entire approach on all issues,"" Goodman says. ""The important thing is to agree on the action, not on the narrative surrounding it."" For Goodman, ""shrinking the conflict"" can readily fit into a left-wing narrative about a two-state solution, since most of the proposed initiatives can be viewed as important steps on the road to building a Palestinian state. Right-wingers, Goodman asserts, can feel the same, since the approach -- for now -- only bolsters Palestinian autonomy and doesn't imply statehood or preclude Israel from annexing the rest of the West Bank, as Bennett has argued for years. Goodman's critics from both the right and the left aren't as sanguine. For the right, the steps Goodman is promoting likely run a higher security risk than he appreciates, and in any case miss the larger point. ""This conflict is not due to 'friction' between Israelis and Palestinians. It was there before and it'll be there after, even if the left makes us leave [the West Bank],"" says Ran Baratz, a public diplomacy director for former Prime Minister Netanyahu. ""You think you're shrinking the conflict, but for the other [Palestinian] side it's just a lull between wars where they're improving their position."" The left, at best, doesn't see much new in Goodman's thesis and at worst is suspicious that ""shrinking the conflict"" is the same approach adopted in the past by the Israeli right -- ""managing the conflict"" or ""economic peace"" -- only rebranded. According to Dahlia Scheindlin, a political analyst at the Century Foundation think tank, Goodman's approach appears to ""perpetuate the paradigm of Israel giveth and Israel taketh away, and it's unclear if it's sincere regarding genuine Palestinian self-determination."" The new Israeli government, she adds, ""latched onto a slogan, but I don't know what content behind the slogan they're actually going to implement and what their intention is behind it."" Palestinians appear bemused by this wholly Israeli debate about what is fundamentally their future too. ""It's nice that Goodman is analyzing what can bring 80% of Israelis to consensus about the conflict, but can this issue be resolved if only one side agrees? I doubt it,"" says Samer Sinijwali, an activist and internal dissident from the ruling Palestinian Fatah party. ""I'd prefer if one Israeli and one Palestinian talked about what 80% of Israelis and Palestinians can agree on."" Goodman, for his part, argues that increasing Palestinian self-governance is a good unto itself that will only improve Palestinian lives and increase Israel's options in future. After all, he says, the old approaches haven't delivered. ""We won't get to peace through big diplomatic pushes, it'll only be through small steps until the Palestinians achieve a critical mass of self-governance. At that point the positions of many Israelis and Palestinians will likely change. Right now our imagination is so limited.""","{'neg': 0.201, 'neu': 0.67, 'pos': 0.129, 'compound': -0.1007}",54,105.0,0.083,0.917,0.0,-0.18489999999999998,0.086,0.821,0.093,0.9506,-9.984599999999999,-2.5479999999999956,188.0,-0.013553191489361679
Biden meets with new Israeli prime minister: 'We've become close friends',2021-08-27,"When Israel's prime minister visited the White House on Friday, for the first time in 12 years it was someone other than Benjamin Netanyahu. That alone lent the talks a sense of renewal, even though stark differences remain between President Joe Biden and his new Israeli counterpart Naftali Bennett. ""I bring with me a new spirit,"" Bennett said in warm remarks from the Oval Office as the meeting was getting underway, ""a spirit of good will, a spirit of hope, a spirit of decency and honesty, a spirit of unity and bipartisanship, of folks who -- as you suggested -- harbor very different political opinions, even opposing, yet we all share the deep passion to work together to build a better future for Israel."" ""We've become close friends,"" Biden said, though he'd just met the new prime minister for the first time an hour earlier.  Friday's meeting had originally been scheduled for a day earlier but was postponed in the wake of a deadly terrorist attack in Kabul that killed 13 American service members. Biden cleared his schedule for meetings with top national security officials. He and Bennett spoke by phone on Thursday evening ahead of the rescheduled talks. The delay by a day means Bennett, an Orthodox Jew, will remain in Washington until Saturday evening after the Sabbath ends, his office said. In warm remarks, Biden hailed Bennett's coalition as the ""most diverse government in Israeli history,"" and said the US was committed to ensuring Iran never develops a nuclear weapon. ""We're putting diplomacy first. If diplomacy fails, we're ready to turn to other options,"" he said, without elaborating. He spoke in only broad terms about other issues in the region, saying he planned to discuss ""ways for increased peace and prosperity for Israelis and Palestinians."" ""The US will always be there for Israel. It's an unshakable partnership between our two nations,"" Biden said. Biden's meeting with Bennett was arranged quickly after the Israeli leader formed a government earlier this summer, depriving Netanyahu of another term in office. The enthusiasm in Washington for new Israeli leadership was palpable: Biden telephoned Bennett less than two hours after he was sworn in, and US officials immediately began work toward setting up a meeting. Bennett arrived in Washington vowing to reset his country's ties to the United States. Animosity lingered from the ice-cold relationship between Netanyahu and former President Barack Obama, whose pursuit of diplomacy with Iran led to tense disagreements. Some White House officials believed Netanyahu would resume his adversarial stance with Biden. The view was cemented when Israel began curtailing intelligence sharing this spring, according to The New York Times. With Bennett now in power, Biden aides believe a reset is at hand. Already, CIA Director William Burns has traveled to Israel, a signal the intelligence relationship is being restored. While in Washington, Bennett was also meeting with the secretaries of state and defense.  When he met Biden, it was their first ever encounter -- one of the rare foreign leaders Biden has never met over the course of his long career in politics (he first met Netanyahu, for example, in the 1980s). Ultimately, the difference in approach is as much -- perhaps more -- in style than substance: Bennett, the right-wing leader of a diverse coalition government, has very different views than Biden of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the best approach toward Iran. But he's said he'll adopt a less combative tone. Like Netanyahu, he is opposed to restarting the Iran nuclear deal, which Biden has sought to re-enter through talks in Vienna. That diplomacy has proceeded in fits and starts, however, and US administration officials have made clear Tehran's nuclear program is advancing quickly. ""Iran's nuclear program has just dramatically broken out of the box, and it's accelerating from week to week. This is a very serious problem, and the two leaders, I think, will have the opportunity to sit together and discuss what to do about it,"" one US official told reporters ahead of the visit.   ""We, of course, committed to a diplomatic path,"" the official went on. ""We think that is the best way to put a ceiling on the program and roll back the gains that Iran has made over recent years on the nuclear side. But obviously, if that doesn't work, there are other avenues to pursue."" The White House hasn't elaborated on what those ""other avenues"" might entail. Biden, who has said he wants to refocus American foreign policy away from decades-old conflicts toward modern-day threats like Russia and China, has not prioritized Middle East peace. He and his aides say they believe the conditions are not right for direct talks between the Israelis and Palestinians. When a conflict erupted between Israel and militants in Gaza this spring, Biden was reluctantly brought into the decades-old issue and helped broker a ceasefire. Major breakthroughs are not expected on that front during the Friday meeting, and Bennett does not support a two-state solution resulting in an independent Palestinian state that Biden has backed for years.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.763, 'pos': 0.237, 'compound': 0.4767}",38,106.0,0.09666666666666666,0.8848333333333334,0.0185,-0.31379999999999997,0.08,0.799,0.122,0.9833,-11.924399999999999,14.383700000000005,184.0,0.07817228260869567
Biden looks for air-clearing in first meeting with Israel's new leader,2021-08-25,"When Israel's prime minister visits the White House on Thursday, for the first time in 12 years, it will be someone other than Benjamin Netanyahu. That alone has lent the talks a sense of renewal, even though stark differences remain between President Joe Biden and his new counterpart, Naftali Bennett. Biden views the Oval Office meeting as a reset opportunity with Israel, senior US administration officials said ahead of the talks -- a chance to clear the air after years of stormy relations between Netanyahu and Democratic US administrations.  Biden wasted little time inviting Bennett to the White House, and phoned him two hours after the new prime minister was sworn into office in June -- a distinct difference from the near-month it took Biden to call Netanyahu after his own inauguration at the beginning of this year. Coming as a frantic airlift effort in Kabul enters its final days, the meeting also provides Biden an opening to focus attention somewhere other than Afghanistan.  Major divides still exist between Biden and the right-wing Bennett, particularly over the Iran nuclear deal and Israeli settlements in the West Bank. Bennett has rejected the idea of a two-state solution to end the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, something Biden has supported for decades. But the White House still views Bennett's diverse coalition government -- formed from parties on the right, left and center to prevent Netanyahu from staying in power -- as a positive example of democracy at work. The administration is hopeful it portends a new era in US-Israel ties. ""It's showing that people with divergent background and views can come together to solve big problems,"" a senior administration official said in previewing the Thursday meeting, citing Biden's oft-repeated belief that the world's democracies must prove their worth against authoritarian regimes. The air-clearing that officials hope will come from the meeting arrives against the backdrop of the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, which is on track to be complete by next week. Biden on Tuesday affirmed the August 31 deadline to get all US forces out of the country. Part of his rationale for ending America's longest war has been a desire to realign American foreign policy to more modern-day priorities. That mostly means countering threats from Russia and China -- not necessarily the seemingly intractable politics of the Middle East, which Biden was reluctantly dragged into in May when violence flared between Israel and Gaza. Still, officials said the end of the Afghanistan war could still lend more time for officials to focus on places like Israel. ""If anything, the end of America's military involvement in Afghanistan frees up resources and attention and ultimately allows us to better support our partners like Israel,"" the official said. ""If anything, in the Biden administration we are not pursuing unachievable goals,"" the official went on. ""We are not trying to transform the Middle East, we are not trying to overthrow regimes. We are pursuing a very steady course, centered on achievable aims, alignment of ends and means, and first and foremost, support to our partners and, of course, Israel being second to none."" On Iran, officials acknowledge there are stark differences. Bennett hopes to convince Biden not to rejoin the Iran nuclear deal after Biden renewed talks with Iran earlier this year. But it's unlikely he will publicly lecture Biden on the issue in the fashion of Netanyahu, who enraged the Obama administration with his public advocacy against the deal.  Short of convincing Biden of the pact's failings, Bennett is expected to raise the need for other options should diplomacy fail in curbing Iran's nuclear ambitions. And US officials admit Tehran's nuclear program is advancing worrisomely fast. ""The two leaders will have an opportunity to sit together and discuss what to do about it,"" the official said, saying the US belief remains that diplomacy is the best avenue to roll back Iran's nuclear gains. ""Obviously if that doesn't work, there are other avenues to pursue,"" the official said. The two leaders also plan to discuss the Abraham Accords, struck during the previous administration, that normalized relations between Israel and some Muslim-majority nations. The Biden administration has been working behind the scenes to expand those arrangements. And the leaders will engage in what official predicted would be a constructive discussions on relations with the Palestinians after May's cross-border conflict with militants in Gaza, even though Biden and Bennett do not see eye-to-eye. The White House acknowledges that talks between Israelis and Palestinians aren't feasible in the near-term, namely because Bennett's own coalition government is divided on the best approach. Bennett is set to meet with Secretary of State Antony Blinken ahead of his meeting with Biden, where he will tell Blinken that Israel seeks to ""preserve stability"" with the Palestinians, but not take any steps that change ""the reality"" of the current situation, an Israeli official told reporters Wednesday. Still, officials say the White House is encouraged by steps Bennett has taken to deescalate the situation, including improving conditions in the West Bank and Gaza. More than any specific issue, however, officials are looking forward to a visit that allows Biden a fresh start with a new prime minister. They said they looked for the ""earliest"" opportunity for the two to meet face-to-face, and noted that Bennett himself said as he departed for Washington this week he was ""bringing with me a new spirit of cooperation."" Biden and his team ""are receiving him very much in that spirit,"" an official said.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",35,107.0,0.0356,0.8744,0.0898,0.193025,0.054,0.836,0.111,0.9949,6.755875,0.9037750000000031,193.0,0.004682772020725405
The meeting with a foreign leader the Biden presidency desperately needs,2021-08-24,"President George H.W. Bush was convinced Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir had lied to him about settlements during their first meeting. President Bill Clinton was so exasperated with Benjamin Netanyahu that he shouted to aides: ""Who's the f**king superpower here?"" when their first meeting concluded. And President Barack Obama felt the same way after being treated to the famous Netanyahu lectures on politics of the Middle East. There is no danger of a sequel when Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett sits down with President Joe Biden on Thursday at the White House. Indeed, Bennett is almost certain to have one of the smoothest White House meetings with a US President in recent years.  It won't be the sugar high of the Donald Trump-Netanyahu relationship. There are significant differences between Israel and the US on several challenging matters -- including how to deal with Iran's nuclear aspirations and the Palestinian issue. But neither Biden nor Bennett is looking for any unpleasantness, let alone a fight. Both have an overriding interest not just in managing these divisions, but in projecting a close and warm relationship. For Biden, Bennett will be his first meeting with an important US ally in the middle of the first major foreign policy crisis of his presidency. The Afghanistan crisis has highlighted issues such as competency, credibility and relationship management with allies for a president who has touted his skill in all three but has been found wanting. The Bennett meeting won't solve Biden's Afghanistan problem, but it might offer the US President an easy chance to change the channel -- however briefly -- and project the confidence and assurance of a president consulting closely with a core US partner.  Well before the Afghanistan crisis broke, Biden had a stake in creating a positive bond with Bennett. One of the myths about the US-Israel relationship is that Israel does not play favorites in our politics, and we don't play favorites in theirs. Nothing could be further from the truth.  Within hours of the new Israeli government being sworn in, Biden had called Bennett to offer his congratulations -- having waited more than three weeks to reach out to Netanyahu after his own inauguration. And Biden has intentionally slow-walked the opening of the US Consulate -- essentially America's diplomatic representative to the  Palestinians -- in Jerusalem so as not to embarrass Bennett with his right-wing coalition partners.  Biden has a major stake in seeing the Bennett government succeed -- and not just to keep Netanyahu out of power, but because he senses that while progress on Iran and the Palestinians will still be tough with Bennett, himself a right winger, Israel might be inclined to show some flexibility given the diversity of the current parliamentary coalition.  Biden also knows that Bennett will not try to undermine him at home by cavorting with the Republicans like Netanyahu did. Indeed, the new government has all but committed itself to reaching out to Democrats and restoring bipartisanship to the relationship.  The May crisis between Israel and Hamas surprised the administration and forced Biden to navigate a fine line between a Republican Party seeking to establish itself as the go-to party on Israel and a divided Democratic Party whose progressive wing pushed Biden to press Israel to be more flexible with the Palestinians. The Bennett government offers Biden a better chance to manage the Palestinian issue so that he can avoid getting caught in the middle of another political battle between Republicans and his own party. As for Bennett, he has every reason to want to create the closest relationship with the Biden administration. Bennett is probably the weakest prime minister in Israel's history, presiding over an unwieldy hodgepodge coalition of right, center and left-wing parties where he controls only six seats. And one of the ways Israelis measure their prime ministers is by their ability to successfully manage Israel's most important relationship with the United States. While Bennett cannot be perceived to be weak on an issue like Iran, where Israel opposes US reentry into the Iran nuclear deal, there's no advantage or point to Bennett having a public fight with Biden on that or any other issue. Negotiations with Iran have been suspended since June, and there's a possibility Iran will try to come back to the table with demands Biden cannot accept. Instead it's more likely that Israel and the US will have a discussion on various scenarios, including how to coordinate policy should Tehran decide that the Iran nuclear accord has run its course. Ditto for the Palestinian issue where there's no chance of a serious negotiation to end the conflict, but where Biden will be looking to Bennett for practical steps, such as strengthening the Palestinian Authority and taking steps to avoid provocation of the Palestinians in Jerusalem and elsewhere.  Bennett needs to understand that Biden's priorities do not begin and end with Israel. And, amid the Afghanistan crisis, he needs to be supportive rather than demanding.  Of course, Israel has its own priorities when it comes to Iran and the Palestinians, and Bennett will lay them out sans the Netanyahu-style lecture. Indeed, Bennett's most important objective during this visit is to establish a personal relationship with Biden based on trust and reciprocity. Then he must make clear that his goal is to find a way to manage both Iran and the Palestinian issues in a way that protects US and Israeli interests. Alas, it won't be easy. This is the Middle East where attended to or not, crisis often ensues, as the May conflict between Israel and Hamas demonstrated. With apologies to the Eagles, the Middle East is like the ""Hotel California"": you can check out anytime you want, but you can never leave. And the two issues that are likely to leave Biden the most exposed are among the most volatile and unpredictable  -- a nuclear Iran and the future of the Palestinians.  For now, Bennett should make friends, not waves. It's currency in the bank with a beleaguered president. And besides, knowing the history of US-Israeli relations, there will always be plenty of time later to argue about these issues.","{'neg': 0.224, 'neu': 0.776, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.3818}",43,108.0,0.027714285714285716,0.9061428571428572,0.06614285714285714,0.34415000000000007,0.105,0.752,0.143,0.9886,14.798450000000003,-0.3546749999999932,209.0,-0.001697009569377958
Israel to offer third Covid-19 vaccine dose to people over 60,2021-07-30,"Israel's Prime Minister has announced a program to roll out a third dose of the coronavirus vaccine to people over the age of 60, becoming one of the first countries in the world to make such a move. People over 60 will need to show they received their second dose of the vaccine at least five months ago. Thursday's announcement follows a strong recommendation from the government-appointed team of experts on the pandemic to offer older adults a third dose. The experts' advice, which came overnight on Wednesday, was based on data suggesting significant waning immunity from infection over time.    Some of the data considered by the health ministry comes from research on the ""justification, safety and efficacy"" of a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for hemodialysis patients that was posted as a pre-print paper earlier this month.  The research found that about two-thirds of hemodialysis patients (people who require the procedure to remove waste products and excess fluid from the blood when the kidneys stop working properly) who had a suboptimal immune response after a second dose of the vaccine developed ""optimal"" antibodies and T cells after a third dose. From Tuesday to Thursday, the number of new cases in Israel has topped two thousand each day -- levels that have not been seen in the country for four and half months. Back in May and June, the number of new daily cases was down to single figures on some days. The number of severe cases currently stands at 151, with the R rate -- the average number of people infected by someone with the virus -- fairly steady for weeks, at 1.3 and 1.4. Israel's highly successful vaccination program first began in December, with then-Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu the first to receive a dose on live television.  The country's vaccination program has won plaudits for its fast rate of making the vaccine available to the entire adult population, and more recently children aged 12 and over. Data from Israel might help inform other countries' decisions to offer a booster shot, including the United States.  On Thursday, US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy told CNN that it's ""very possible"" that a decision on boosters will be made by the end of summer or early fall. ""It could take a bit longer. It could come sooner,"" Murthy added, saying that ""it depends how quickly we see a signal in the data in these cohorts of individuals we're following."" Murthy said data from other countries, including Israel and the US will factor into the decision.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",15,109.0,0.093,0.8,0.107,-0.0276,0.025,0.909,0.066,0.9299,-0.414,-0.7686749999999931,185.0,-0.0041549999999999625
"July 29, 2021 US coronavirus news",2021-07-28,"Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger today said his officers are not intending to make arrests over violations of mask rules in the House. ""We do have the responsibility to enforce the rules here,"" Manger told CNN's Jake Tapper. ""Whether a person wears the mask or doesn't wear a mask, it is not a law it is a rule.""  ""Our role is to encourage people to comply with the rule,"" he said. ""If they don't, we give them the alternative, they can comply or they have to leave."" Manger went on to suggest he's directed officers to avoid arrests if possible. ""The last thing anybody wants is for somebody to be arrested in a situation like that,"" he said. ""...It hasn't happened yet... I don't imagine there being any, but it is up to officers to make sure that they are complying with that mandate."" Earlier today, many House Republicans purposefully defied mask rules reinstated by Capitol Attending Physician Dr. Brian Monahan, appearing on the floor maskless. This is the latest sign of the deep divide and tension between Republicans and Democrats in the House on how to handle the Covid-19 pandemic and various other issues, with it even festering at the top, between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. The state of Illinois announced on Thursday that face coverings are now required in all state facilities for both vaccinated and unvaccinated people.  “Given that the majority of the state is experiencing substantial or high COVID-19 transmission as measured by the CDC, all State of Illinois facilities will require face coverings – regardless of vaccination status – in line with the CDC’s current best guidance for ending this pandemic,” said Gov. J.B. Pritzker in a news release.  State employees are now required to cover their nose and mouth while in a workplace or performing work duties in indoor settings unless they have a medical condition, said the release. Employees must also maintain a physical distancing of at least six feet at all times, or as much as reasonably possible while performing work duties. Any visitors above the age of 2 are also required to wear a face-covering while inside state offices unless they have a medical condition that prevents it, said the release. Additionally, state facilities will receive regular cleaning services and employees will be provided cleaning supplies to disinfect their workspaces.  ##Masks## Following a suggestion from President Biden at his Thursday news conference on Covid-19, the state of New Mexico is restarting its incentive program to pay people $100 to get a shot. The revived program, paid for with federal stimulus money, will be available to any registered New Mexican who gets a vaccine dose starting Aug. 2 and continue for the rest of the month. Residents do not have to be fully vaccinated, although no individual can get more than a single $100 payment. The original incentive program “led to a 333% increase in single-shot vaccines and a 26% overall boost in completed vaccinations,” the state's health department said Thursday in a news release. ##Vaccines## Gov. Eric Holcomb renewed the Covid-19 executive orders for Indiana that address the impact and spread of the virus on Thursday.  All businesses and individuals must adhere to the guidelines of the order, which take effect Aug. 1 and continue through Aug. 30, according to the orders. Some context: Since the governor first issued the order on March 6, 2020, the virus has spread to every Indiana county within the state with over 768,000 confirmed cases and over 13,500 deaths.  According to the order, the state has demonstrated a seven-day average positivity rate which has risen to 6.3% from 2.1% in a month. There have been new confirmed cases daily and continued hospitalizations and deaths. As a result of this, the executive order says everyone in the state should take responsibility for their health and safety, as well as the safety of those around them by taking preventative matters.  According to the order, over 2.9 million people have been vaccinated out of the 5.7 million eligible and 98% of new Covid-19 cases are from those who are unvaccinated. The order strongly encourages those ages 12 and above to get vaccinated. ##Vaccines##  The Biden administration is not considering a nationwide Covid-19 vaccine requirement, White House Covid-19 Response Coordinator Jeff Zients said Thursday. “That’s not an authority that we're exploring at all,” Zients told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. President Biden announced Thursday that all federal employees must attest to being vaccinated or agree to regular testing and other protocols.  Zients noted that Biden’s “Justice Department has said that it is legal for employers to require vaccinations.” ##Vaccines## The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it will release a study Friday that supports this week’s decision to change mask guidance. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Tuesday the agency was changing guidelines for fully vaccinated people because of new science. She said even fully vaccinated people should wear masks indoors in areas where transmission of the virus is substantial or high.  Walensky said new data indicated that people who get breakthrough infections involving the Delta variant of the virus can be as likely to infect someone else as unvaccinated people are. And she promised that data would be released soon.  ##Masks## The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) will require weekly Covid-19 testing for all students and employees returning to in-person learning, regardless of vaccination status, school officials announced in a news release Thursday. ""All students and employees, both vaccinated and unvaccinated, returning for in-person instruction must participate in baseline and ongoing weekly COVID testing,"" the district said. ""This is in accordance with the most recent guidance from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health."" LAUSD is the second-largest school district in the country with more than 600,000 students. Testing for all students and employees begins on Aug. 2, officials said. Full return to in-person instruction across most LAUSD campuses begins on Aug. 16. The district's preparations for the start of the new school year also include mandatory masking indoors for all students, staff, and visitors, officials said. Legal guardians of students will be required to schedule the ongoing Covid-19 testing appointments. All results will be emailed and shared with appropriate scientists, administrators, and health authorities, officials said. ""Ultimately, the greatest protection against COVID and the Delta variant is vaccination,"" said Megan Reilly, LAUSD interim superintendent. ""We encourage everyone who is eligible to be vaccinated."" CNN has reached out to United Teachers Los Angeles, the union which represents LAUSD teachers, for comment. ##Vaccines## As most of Nevada prepares for an indoor mask mandate to resume Friday, state health officials say it’s their best option right now to slow the Delta variant.  “We also understand the frustration many of you may feel over having to put a mask back on,” Candice McDaniel, who's with the Division of Welfare and Supportive Services, said in a telebriefing Thursday. “We don’t like it either.” Officials said the number of people getting their first Covid-19 vaccine has increased over the past two weeks, signaling that more people are taking the rise in cases seriously.  But McDaniel said it’s still a bigger challenge to convince people to get vaccinated than it was when shots were in short supply.  “Now we are working on a smaller scale in neighborhoods, connecting with people and answering questions,” she said. ##Masks## House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said every member of Congress should be vaccinated or submit to regular tests to ensure they are not carrying the virus.  ""Every member ought to be vaccinated or in the alternative, certainly we're requiring now every member to wear a mask,"" he told CNN's Jake Tapper today. Those who are not vaccinated ""ought to have to be tested on a relatively regular basis to make sure they're not bringing virus into the chamber,"" added Hoyer.  Earlier today, many House Republicans purposefully defied mask rules reinstated by Capitol Attending Physician Dr. Brian Monahan, appearing on the floor maskless. This is the latest sign of the deep divide and tension between Republicans and Democrats in the House on how to handle the Covid-19 pandemic and various other issues, with it even festering at the top, between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has issued an executive order that would provide what he called ""clarity and uniformity"" in the state's Covid-19 response, adding that the path forward relies on ""personal responsibility rather than government mandates."" Abbott said in news release issued by the governor's office, that Texans ""have the individual right and responsibility to decide for themselves and their children whether they will wear masks, open their businesses, and engage in leisure activities."" ""To further ensure that no governmental entity can mandate masks, the following requirement shall continue to apply: No governmental entity, including a county, city, school district, and public health authority, and no governmental official may require an person to wear a face-covering or to mandate that other person wear a covering,"" the executive order said. State-supported living centers, government-owned hospitals and government-operated hospitals may continue to use ""appropriate policies regarding the wearing of face coverings,"" according to the order.  The Texas Department of Criminal Justice, the Texas Juvenile Justice Department and any county and municipal jails ""may continue to use appropriate policies regarding the wearing of face coverings.""  Additionally, to ""preserve livelihoods,"" the order stated, "" there are no Covid-19-related operating limits for any business or other establishment."" In areas where Covid-19 transmission is high, people are encouraged to follow safe practices. However, ""no person may be required by any jurisdiction to wear or to mandate the wearing of a face covering.""  ##Masks## During a brief Q&A following his remarks from the White House East Room, President Biden told reporters Thursday that while he’d like to see private entities continue to mandate vaccines in employees, “It's still a question whether the federal government can mandate the whole country” and require vaccines. “I had asked the Justice Department to determine whether that is, they're able to [pass vaccine mandates] legally,” Biden said, “and they can — local communities can do that, local businesses can do that. It's still a question whether the federal government can mandate the whole country. I don't know that yet.” The President made clear that the administration was not considering lockdowns based on guidance at hand, telling reporters in the East Room, “If tomorrow I could wave a wand and every American was vaccinated, then, in fact, we'd be out in the woods. Now, can something else happen a year from now, can there be a different virus, can there be something? It’s possible. And I'm talking about Covid and the existing variants have come forward so far.” Biden reiterated that at this time, “a booster shot is not needed,” but acknowledged, “Now it's possible that it will be needed later — I don't know, they don't, science hasn't dictated that yet.”  Pressed on if he’d like to see a vaccine mandate take effect in the Department of Defense before the vaccine gets final approval from the US Food and Drug Administration, Biden was less committal, telling reporters that final FDA approval “usually takes a lot of a lot of work to get there.” “I made a commitment I would not tell anyone in the Justice Department who they should prosecute, and I would not tell the health industry that they should be — government health entities what they should say and do, but my expectation is, they're going to reach that conclusion in the early fall.” ##Vaccines## In nearly 30 minutes of remarks, President Biden outlined a series of new efforts from his administration aimed at increasing vaccination rates, touting them as incentives “to encourage unvaccinated Americans to get vaccinated."" Here are some of the measures:  Expanding paid leave for employees who take time off to get themselves and their family members vaccinated. Biden said employers would be reimbursed. 
The Treasury Department said Biden will also be calling on states, territories, and local governments to do more to incentivize vaccination, including offering $100 to Americans getting vaccinated, paid for with American Rescue Plan funding.
The President called on school districts nationwide to host at least one pop-up vaccination clinic over the coming weeks to get more kids 12 and older vaccinated. Biden also announced he would ""impose requirements on key groups, to make sure they're vaccinated.""  Here's a look at those steps:  Biden said every federal government employee and on-site contractor will be asked to attest to their vaccination status. Employees who have not been vaccinated ""will be required to wear a mask on the job no matter their geographic location, physically distance from all other employees and visitors, comply with a weekly or twice weekly screening testing requirement, and be subject to restrictions on official travel,"" Biden said. The federal employee vaccination requirement is not a mandate, officials have insisted, and most federal employees who do not get vaccinated will not lose their jobs as a result, CNN previously reported.
The President also announced that he is asking the Department of Defense ""to look into how and when they will add Covid-19 to the list of vaccinations that our armed forces must get."" How some groups are responding: Several groups representing federal workers across the government are already raising concerns about the requirement, including groups representing federal law enforcement officers, IRS managers and members of the US Border Patrol, among others. Others groups, like the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, have come out in support. Read more about Biden's announcement here.  ##Vaccines## President Biden said Thursday that, despite rising cases and the prevalence of the Delta variant in the US, there remains no need for booster shots for vaccinated Americans.  “I also know many of you are wondering if you need a booster shot to add another layer of protection, as my medical advisors say the answer is no,” Biden said in remarks from the White House. “No American needs a booster now. But if the science tells us there's a need for boosters, then that's something we'll do, and we’ve purchased the supply, all the supply we need to be ready if that was called for.” Any decision on a booster dose of a Covid-19 vaccine in the US is still awaiting more data, a prominent member of the US Food and Drug Administration’s vaccine advisory committee told CNN on Thursday.   “It depends on the data,” Dr. Paul Offit told CNN. The President also tried to reassure Americans concerned about the threat of breakthrough cases, acknowledging that while, “Yes, some fully vaccinated people still test positive, and some will also show symptoms of Covid-19, that's expected for almost every vaccine there is for other diseases-- but breakthrough cases remain rare in almost all our mild cases.”  “In fact, virtually all hospitalizations and deaths are among the unvaccinated,” Biden said. ##Vaccines## President Biden said the country ""must open"" schools in the fall with proper safety measures and protocols, including masking indoors.  ""I also want to speak to families with children in school. We can and we must open schools this fall, full-time. It's better for our children's mental and emotional well-being, and we can't afford another year out of the classroom. Every school should be open, and we're giving them the tools to be able to do so safely, even in those areas where...  they have a higher rate of Covid. Through the American Rescue Plan we provided schools billions of dollars to implement safety measures, better ventilation, social distancing and other measures,"" the President said in remarks from the White House.  Biden noted that vaccination rates among teachers are high and promoted the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention mask guidelines for students.  ""Almost 90% of educators and school staff are now vaccinated. Additionally, the CDC has provided clear guidance on how all schools can safely protect the kids and bring them back to the classroom. Every student wear a mask. It's that simple. So we funded safety measures at schools. We've vaccinated teachers and staff, and we can mask up our kids for further protection. Once again, there's one more thing we need to do. Get more adolescents, ages 12 and up, vaccinated now that they've been cleared,"" the President said.  Biden also said the government is prepared to provide vaccinations to children 12 and under once the vaccines are ""deemed safe for them.""  Some more background: The CDC recommended on Tuesday that localities encourage all teachers, staff, students, and visitors in schools to wear masks indoors, regardless of vaccination status. Previously, the CDC updated its Covid-19 guidance for schools earlier this month, noting that fully vaccinated people did not have to wear masks, and then about a week later the American Academy of Pediatrics issued stricter guidance recommending that everyone older than 2 wear a mask in schools, regardless of their vaccination status. CNN's Jacqueline Howard contributed reporting to this post.  ##Schools## President Biden has tasked the Defense Department with making the Covid-19 vaccine one of the required vaccinations for all active-duty service people. ""Since many vaccinations are required for active-duty military today, I'm asking the Defense Department to look into how and when they will add Covid-19 to the list of vaccinations that our armed forces must get. Our men and women in uniform will protect this country from grave threats should be protected as much as possible from getting Covid-19,"" Biden said this afternoon during remarks from the White House. ""I think this is particularly important because our troops serve in places throughout the world, many where vaccination rates are low and disease is prevalent,"" the President continued.  ##Vaccines## President Biden announced new vaccine rules for federal workers as part of his administration's efforts to get more Americans vaccinated and curb the spread of the pandemic.  ""Every federal government employee will be asked to attest to their vaccination status. Anyone who does not attest or is not vaccinated will be required to mask no matter where they work, test one or two times a week to see if they've acquired Covid, socially distance, and generally will not be allowed to travel for work,"" Biden said in White House remarks.  Biden noted that similar steps will be applied to all federal contractors.  ""If you want to do business with the federal government, get your workers vaccinated,"" the President said.  ##Vaccines## President Biden urged people to get vaccinated saying they're ""highly effective"" and that there's ""nothing political about them.""  Biden commended Republicans who have advocated for Covid-19 vaccines.  ""From the start I have to compliment Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, he hasn't made it political. He's encouraged people to get vaccinated, he's encouraged people to get vaccinated, he's continued to do so and his state's in pretty good shape. Alabama Republican Governor Kay Ivey recently spoke out to encourage vaccinations, and even the commentators on Fox who have been belittling us for a long time, some haven't but many have, are arguing get vaccinated. Look, this is not about red states and blue states, it's literally about life and death... that's what it's about,"" Biden said.  ##Vaccines## President Biden shared a somber warning for the millions of Americans who have yet to get the Covid-19 vaccine, warning them that ""you don't have to die."" ""This is an American tragedy,"" Biden said during remarks from the White House, specifically discussing those who are unvaccinated and hospitalized: ""People are dying and will die who don't have to die. If you're out there unvaccinated, you don't have to die."" ##Vaccines## President Biden championed the Covid-19 today during remarks from the White House, adding that the US has ""enough vaccine for everyone to get vaccinated."" ""[W]e've administered over 325 million vaccinations doses in the past six months,"" Biden said Thursday afternoon. ""We have the tools to prevent this new wave of Covid from shutting down our businesses, our schools, our society as we saw happen last year. I've said from the beginning that we will be guided by the science."" ##Vaccines## President Biden highlighted the dangers of misinformation as the Delta variant fuels the spread of Covid-19 among the unvaccinated population across the country.  ""I want to talk about what's really happening, what it means, what it doesn't mean, and what we need to do this week and the months ahead. From the moment I was elected, I said I'd always give to you straight from the shoulder, and we need some straight talk right now,"" the President during remarks at the White House.  ""There's a lot of fear and misinformation in the country, and we need to cut through it with facts, with science, with the truth. So what's really happening today? After months and months of cases going down we're seeing a spike in Covid cases. They're going up. Why? Because of this new form, this new variant called the Delta variant. This is a much different variant than the one we dealt with previously. It's highly transmissible, and it's causing a new wave of cases in those that are not vaccinated,"" he said.  Biden continued: ""Our experts told me that cases will go up further before they start to go down. While cases are on the rise, what we're not likely to see, according to experts, is a comparable rise in hospitalizations or deaths in most areas of the country. You have to ask yourself, why is that? Because 164 million Americans are fully vaccinated, including 80% of the most vulnerable, our seniors. So there's a challenge, as you knew there could be."" The President noted that despite the challenges, the good news is that the Covid-19 vaccines are ""highly effective"" and the US has ""enough vaccine for everybody to get vaccinated."" ##Delta Variant## ##Vaccines## President Biden is delivering remarks from the White House on his administration's next efforts to combat the Covid-19 pandemic and get more Americans vaccinated.  According to a White House fact sheet, Biden will announce that, in an attempt to protect workers, “every federal government employee and onsite contractor will be asked to attest to their vaccination status.” Employees who have not been vaccinated “will be required to wear a mask on the job no matter their geographic location, physically distance from all other employees and visitors, comply with a weekly or twice weekly screening testing requirement, and be subject to restrictions on official travel.” It's not a mandate, officials insist, and most federal employees who do not get vaccinated will not lose their jobs as a result. Still, the shift toward placing the onus for the current situation on those who have refused to get vaccinated reflects Biden's growing impatience that still-hesitant Americans are prolonging a crisis he said earlier this month was no longer paralyzing the nation. During his speech Thursday, he also plans to directly address the millions who have procrastinated or outright refused to get vaccinated. What the latest vaccination and case numbers show: As of Wednesday, cases rose in all but one state in the past seven days compared to the week before, and cases rose at least 50% in 36 states in that time, according to Johns Hopkins. The rate of people getting their first Covid-19 vaccine shot has risen in recent days. The current pace of vaccinations (seven-day average) shows 389,963 people are initiating vaccination each day — a 31% increase over last week’s pace.  Still, only 49.4% of the total US population is fully vaccinated, according to data published Thursday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This is far from the 70% to 85% that experts have estimated would be needed to slow or stop the spread of the virus. Meanwhile, nearly 80% of seniors (65+) are fully vaccinated and nearly 90% have at least one dose.  Read more about Biden's speech here.  CNN's Deidre McPhillips, Jason Hanna and Madeline Holcombe contributed reporting to this post.  ##Vaccines## The White House has shared a fact sheet detailing new actions the Biden administration is taking aim at getting more Americans vaccinated and slowing the spread of the Delta variant. Per the fact sheet, President Biden will announce that, in an attempt to protect workers, “every federal government employee and the onsite contractor will be asked to attest to their vaccination status.”  Employees who have not been vaccinated “will be required to wear a mask on the job no matter their geographic location, physically distance from all other employees and visitors, comply with a weekly or twice-weekly screening testing requirement, and be subject to restrictions on official travel.” In addition, the President is expected to announce a directive ordering the Department of Defense “to look into how and when they will add Covid-19 vaccination to the list of required vaccinations for members of the military.” More on the actions: Also included in the administration’s efforts announced Thursday — expanded paid leave for employees who take time off to get themselves and their family members vaccinated. The President will also call on states, territories, and local governments to do more to incentivize vaccination, including offering $100 to Americans getting vaccinated (Treasury released an announcement touting the incentive Thursday). Finally, the President will call on school districts nationwide to host at least one pop-up vaccination clinic over the coming weeks “in an effort to get more kids 12 and older vaccinated.” ##Vaccines## Employees of the state of New Mexico are the latest to be told the Covid-19 vaccine is no longer optional, unless they want to be subject to regular coronavirus testing.  “Right now, it’s very simple: Get a vaccine, or else you will be tested,” Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, said in a news release. “There will be no quarter for this virus within state government offices. I will not tolerate any unnecessary risk within the workforce under my authority.” The governor’s order takes effect Monday. Her announcement comes on the same day President Biden is expected to announce a similar order for federal workers. State employees who are not fully vaccinated are also required to wear a mask indoors while working under the new order. The governor’s office says employees who do not comply may be disciplined, including the possibility of losing their jobs.  “I have absolutely zero appetite for another unnecessary surge of infections, hospitalizations and death,” the governor said. “This isn’t a debate. The vaccines are safe, and they work.” ##Vaccines## The Treasury Department says President Biden will call on state and local governments to provide $100 payments for every new vaccinated American. ""Today, the President is calling on state, territorial, and local governments to provide $100 payments for every newly vaccinated American, as an extra incentive to boost vaccination rates, protect communities, and save lives. Treasury stands ready to give technical assistance to state and local governments so that they may use the funds effectively to support increased vaccination in their communities, and Treasury will partner with the Department of Health and Human Services throughout this effort,"" the department said in a news release.  Biden is set to deliver remarks at 4 p.m. ET and is expected to announce that all federal employees must attest to being vaccinated against Covid-19 or face strict protocols including regular testing, masking and other mitigation measures, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter. ##Vaccines## Ahead of President Biden's remarks on Covid-19, White House Principal deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre acknowledged that the Biden administration is hoping private companies will follow its example in requiring employees be vaccinated for Covid-19. “We see ourselves as a model for other for other companies and other organization, and that's something that we don't take lightly.” “We see ourselves as a model for other for other companies and other organization, and that's something that we don't take lightly,"" Jean-Pierre told CNN. ""The President's goal these last six months is to really work to curb this pandemic, this virus, to fight against it, but it's going to take all of us, it's going to take all of us to do that, and our push, our message continues to be, we have to make sure that people get vaccinated, and we're going to continue to do that, as we've done these last six month."" Earlier Thursday: Biden hopes steps announced Thursday requiring vaccinations for federal employees will lead to more federal workers getting shots, he views the broader goal of providing an example — and political and legal cover — to other employers as equally important.  “As a large employer — the largest in this country, who cares about the individuals who keep the government running, we have an obligation to be good stewards of the workforce and ensure their health and their safety. We're taking action to protect the federal workforce so that they can continue to execute on the hard and important work of government,” Jean-Pierre told reporters Thursday. Jean-Pierre would not share the percentage of federal employees already vaccinated, nor would she share any changes to the testing protocol for the President or those who work in close contact with him. ##Vaccines## Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson announced today he was reinstating the public health emergency in the state because of the rise in Covid-19 cases. “Anytime you are having staffing shortages in hospital(s). Whenever, today I believe, it’s four Covid patients that are waiting in ambulances to be able to find a hospital to go to. That constitutes an emergency and a public health crisis,” Hutchinson said. Hutchinson acknowledged the state legislature must review the order but said, “as of today, I've signed the proclamation for the public health emergency declaration, which will extend for 60 days."" ""Yes, this has to be reviewed by the General Assembly, it is in effect today the emergency is in effect today, but they will be able to convene as a committee of the whole to review that. But I am declaring that emergency today,"" the governor added. Average Covid-19 hospitalization rates are nearly three times higher among states that have fully vaccinated less than half of their residents vs. the average among those that have vaccinated more than half of their residents, according to a CNN analysis of federal data. And Covid-19 case and death rates over the past week are more than twice as high among states that have vaccinated less than half of their residents, on average.  Here's a breakdown of the data:  Current hospitalizations, according data from the US Department of Health and Human Services: Average among states that have vaccinated less than half of residents: 14.4 per 100,000 residents
Average among states that have vaccinated more than half of residents: 4.9 per 100,000 residents Daily Covid-19 case rate over past week, according to data from Johns Hopkins University: Average among states that have vaccinated less than half of residents: 23.7 per 100,000 residents
Average among states that have vaccinated more than half of residents: 9.3 per 100,000 Daily Covid-19 death rate over past week, according to data from Johns Hopkins University: Average among states that have vaccinated less than half of residents: 129 per 1 million residents
Average among states that have vaccinated more than half of residents: 55 per 1 million residents Vermont has the highest vaccination rate (more than 67% fully vaccinated) and the lowest current Covid-19 hospitalization rate (less than 1 per 100,000 residents). Meanwhile, Florida has the highest current Covid-19 hospitalization rate – about 38 people hospitalized per 100,000 residents, and less than 49% of the state’s population is fully vaccinated. Note: Data on state vaccination rates is from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ##Vaccines## Falling vaccination rates put children in a tough position as schools return to in-person learning, and necessitate decisions on masking and vaccine boosters, Dr. Paul Offit told CNN on Thursday. Offit is the director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “I just feel like we let our children down by not keeping up the vaccination rates we had a couple months ago,” Offit told CNN’s Ana Cabrera.  “We were at 3 million doses a day a couple months ago. If we’d stayed on that pace, we’d probably be at at least 80% population immunity from vaccination,” he said, “which would mean we wouldn’t have had to have these discussions about things like booster dosing and masking.” Problems stemming from low vaccination rates are now converging with schools returning in the fall, he said.  “We have a school population that is now, a young population between 6 and 12 years of age who are unlikely to get a vaccination when they go back to school,” he said, “And it’ll be fall and winter when it spreads more easily and there’s a very contagious variant out there.”  ##Schools## ##Vaccines## Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear recommended that all school districts in the state require K-12 students and staff to wear face masks this fall.  ""To the schools, you teach science in your classroom, you should have to consider it when making decisions,"" Beshear said at a briefing Thursday. Beshear urged every superintendent and school board ""to do the right thing, just make the right decision"" to require face masks indoors at schools.  ""We have to continue to fight this battle until it's done,"" said Beshear.  Some more context: Beshear said the state is seeing an ""exploding number of cases in summer camps ""where, unlike schools, ""you're not putting...unvaccinated kids, without masks, in a poorly ventilated room, for hours at a time.""   Beshear also emphasized the dangerous spread of the Covid-19 Delta variant.  ""It's going to spread through unvaccinated workplaces and classrooms, resulting in a loss of productivity, where parents and caregivers cannot go to work due to long quarantines,"" the governor said. ""I'm not currently considering reinstating the mask mandate, we will watch what's happening and again, it's on the table, if it's needed."" The governor stressed that all state employees are still required to wear face masks at work.  ##Masks## Oregon Gov. Kate Brown said Thursday that K-12 schools will require masks to be worn indoors. Consistent with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s latest guidance, Brown directed the Oregon Health Authority and the Oregon Department of Education to create a rule to require masks indoors for K-12 schools statewide for the 2021-22 school year, according to a news release from the governor’s office. “The science and data are clear: the Delta variant is in our communities, and it is more contagious,” Brown said. “My priority is to ensure our kids are able to safely return to full-time in-person learning this fall, five days per week and with minimal disruptions. With many children still ineligible to be vaccinated, masks are an effective way to help keep our kids safe in the classroom, the learning environment we know serves them best.” Brown added that the state is recommending Oregonians statewide wear masks in public indoor spaces and stressed the importance of getting more people vaccinated. “Vaccines remain the most effective and best way to protect ourselves and our families,” the governor said. ##Masks##  ##Schools## Any decision on a booster dose of a Covid-19 vaccine in the US is still awaiting more data, a prominent member of the US Food and Drug Administration’s vaccine advisory committee told CNN on Thursday. “It depends on the data,” Dr. Paul Offit told CNN’s Ana Cabrera. “Right now, as you said, the people who are over 65 who have gotten two doses of the vaccine still are highly protected against severe critical disease, having to seek medical care, go to the hospital, or worse – die,” he said. “I think as long as we’re there, I don’t see any pressing need for a booster dose.” “Right now what we’re pressed to do,” Offit said, “is vaccinate the unvaccinated.” ##Vaccines## Israel’s Prime Minister has announced a program rolling out a third dose of the coronavirus vaccine to people over the age of 60, one of the first countries in the world to make such a move. People will need to show they received their second dose of the vaccine at least five months ago. The announcement follows a strong recommendation overnight from the government-appointed team of experts on the pandemic to offer older adults a third dose. The experts’ advice was based on data suggesting significant waning immunity from infection over time.  The number of new cases in Israel has topped 2,000 for each of the last three days, reaching levels not seen in the country for four and half months. Some days in May and June, the number of new daily cases was down to single figures. The number of severe cases currently stands at 151. The infection co-efficient, or the average number of people infected by someone with the virus, has been fairly steady for weeks between 1.3 and 1.4. Some background: Israel began vaccinating its population in December. Then-Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was the first to receive a dose which he did on live television.  The vaccination program progressed apace and won plaudits for the fast rate at which Israel made the vaccine available to the entire adult population, and more recently children ages 12 and over. ##Vaccines## New York Attorney General Letitia James called for Facebook to crack down on Covid-19 misinformation on Thursday, particularly for Spanish-speaking users of the social media platform.  In a letter to Facebook's VP of state policy, Will Castleberry, James said Latino vaccination rates are among the lowest in the country, making it imperative that Spanish-speaking Americans receive accurate information about the coronavirus vaccine.  It is not enough for social media platforms to supply reliable information, James continued, adding that platforms such as WhatsApp could be doing more such as notifying users when a claim on the app has been previously fact-checked and identified as misinformation, or preventing the sharing of the claim altogether. ""With Facebook as the primary platform of choice for most Latino social media users, it is critical that Facebook improve its Spanish-language moderation and efforts to combat misleading information,"" she wrote.  ""We request that Facebook share with our office its policies and procedures regarding misinformation targeted towards the Latino community as well as any initiatives that Facebook has underway to amplify evidence-based and scientifically accurate material to Latino users,"" James added. James' comments come as the Biden administration continues to battle misinformation surrounding vaccinations.  Earlier this month, US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy warned health misinformation is ""a serious threat to public health,"" and the administration has put pressure on social media giants like Facebook to do more to stop the spread of false information.  ##Vaccines## Israel's Ministry of Health on Thursday published the data that was presented to its Vaccine Advisory Committee last night in support of its recommendation to administer a third dose of coronavirus vaccine to older adults. The Ministry of Health ""recommended the provision of a third vaccine in the older adult population,"" noted an announcement from the Ministry on Thursday. Some of the data considered by the Ministry come from research on the ""justification, safety and efficacy"" of a third dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for hemodialysis patients that was posted as a pre-print paper earlier this month to the server medrxiv.org. The research found that about two-thirds of hemodialysis patients who had a suboptimal immune response after a second dose of vaccine developed ""optimal"" antibody titers and T cells after a third dose. Israel’s health care system has been instructed to make arrangements to begin vaccinating people over the age 60 with a third dose of the Covid-19 vaccine beginning on Sunday, according to a source with knowledge of Israeli health care planning, pending a final government decision to proceed.  Recipients of a third dose will need to show that more than five months have passed since they received their second dose, the source said. ##Vaccines## Covid-19 vaccines are estimated to have prevented 60,000 Covid-19 related deaths in England up to July 23, according to the latest report from Public Health England (PHE). The report also estimated that Covid-19 vaccines have now prevented more than 22 million cases of infection – more than double the estimated number published previously, a PHE press release said Thursday.  The data is based on modeling analysis from PHE and Cambridge University’s MRC Biostatistics Unit. “These figures show the vaccine programme’s remarkable impact on saving lives and reducing the spread of the virus. As cases have increased, the true scale of protection from the vaccine programme has become clear,” Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal, Consultant Epidemiologist at PHE, said. Meanwhile, Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England Jonathan Van Tam told BBC Newsbeat on Thursday that scientists ""do not know whether there will be a fourth wave"" of infections in the UK.  Van Tam added that although he hoped ""the worst is behind us"" it is ""quite possible that we're going to have one or two bumpy periods through autumn and winter, not through COVID, but also through flu and other respiratory viruses as well."" Once the UK has a ""highly vaccinated adult population"" including young people ages 18 to 25, ""the chances of us needing another lockdown are much lower,"" he added. ##Vaccines## More than 71% of the US population — or nearly 237 million people — live in counties considered to have “high” or “substantial” Covid-19 transmission, according to a CNN analysis of data published Wednesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Only 1% of the population — just 3.2 million people — live in areas with “low” transmission. That means the latest mask CDC guidance, which advises even fully vaccinated people to mask up indoors in areas with ""substantial"" or ""high transmission,"" would apply to more than seven in 10 Americans.  About 48% are in “high” transmission counties, and 23% are in counties with “substantial” transmission. This is up from a week ago, when just over half — 50.5% — of Americans lived in counties that fell into either category. Two weeks ago, that number was even lower: 38.5%.  In early June, 2.4% of the population lived in a county with “high” Covid-19 transmission, and another 13% in areas with “substantial” transmission. Meanwhile, Covid-19 cases in the US continue to rise. The country is now averaging 63,698 new each day, according to Johns Hopkins University — that’s a 59% increase over last week’s seven-day average.  According to the CDC, the US is experiencing an uptick in vaccinations. An average of 382,106 people are initiating vaccination each day, the agency's data published Wednesday shows. This is the highest it’s been in three weeks and a 35% increase over last week. At least 49.2% of the total US population is fully vaccinated. Some more context on the data: The CDC considers a county to have “high” transmission if there have been 100 or more cases of Covid-19 per 100,000 residents in the past week, or a test positivity rate of 10% or higher during the same time frame. For “low” transmission, those numbers must be fewer than 10 new cases per 100,000 or a test positivity rate under 5%. Here's a look at the latest community spread trends:  A Texas teachers group is calling on Gov. Greg Abbott to reverse his stance on banning mask mandates in schools, as the new school year approaches and Covid-19 cases are on the rise. The Texas State Teachers Association, the Texas affiliate of the National Education Association, said that individual school districts should be allowed to require masks in school based on the local health conditions in their communities, according to a statement released Tuesday. ""If Gov. Abbott really cares about the health and safety of Texas students, educators and their communities, he will give local school officials and health experts the option of requiring masks in their schools,"" said TSTA president Ovidia Molina. The statement came on the same day the CDC adjusted its school guidelines, recommending all K-12 students wear masks in school. Abbott is standing by the executive order he signed in May, before the Delta variant was spreading at high rates. ""The time for government mask mandates is over—now is the time for personal responsibility,"" he tweeted Tuesday. ""Every Texan has the right to choose whether they will wear a mask or have their children wear masks."" The TSTA noted that the American Academy of Pediatrics has also recommended everyone older than 2 wear a mask in school, and that children under 12 are not yet eligible for Covid-19 vaccines. ""Educators are eager to return to the classroom, but the pandemic is still dangerous,"" Molina said. ##Schools## ##Masks## AstraZeneca said in investor documents published Thursday that it will ask the US Food and Drug Administration for full approval of its Covid-19 vaccine in the second half of 2021. Rather than apply for an Emergency Use Authorization like the other Covid-19 vaccines currently authorized in the United States, the company said it will file a Biologics License Application. The vaccine is being used to protect patients from Covid-19 in more than 100 countries around the world. By the end of this year, the company said it will deliver up to three billion doses of the vaccine globally. Some more background: AstraZeneca’s vaccine was one of the first Covid-19 vaccines developed. The US government pledged to invest $1.2 billion in the vaccine, but it was plagued with problems from the beginning. There were questions about its trial data after the company initially said that a half dose worked better than a full dose in the trial.  Days later, the company admitted the half dose was administered by mistake and dropped that approach. There were additional questions about its effectiveness in the elderly, and reports of rare blood clots. In April, Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNN that even if the FDA granted an emergency use authorization, there was no need for a fourth vaccine in the US. The company did not respond to Fauci’s comments at the time. ##Vaccines## Israel’s healthcare system has been told to make arrangements to begin vaccinating people over 60 with a third dose of the Covid-19 vaccine from Sunday, according to a source with knowledge of Israeli health care planning, pending a final government decision to go ahead with the move. Recipients of a third dose will need to show that more than five months have passed since they received their second dose, the source said.  ##Vaccines## Emergent BioSolutions announced Thursday that the US Food and Drug Administration will allow it to resume the manufacturing of the drug substance that goes into Johnson & Johnson’s Covid-19 vaccine. According to an administration official, the Baltimore plant has not been fully authorized yet, and while production can resume, the FDA will still need to inspect the individual lots of vaccine before they go out for shipment and can be administered.  The plant had been contracted by Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca, but production was stopped after a mix-up earlier this year that involved ingredients for Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine and AstraZeneca’s vaccine resulted in 15 million vaccine doses being spoiled by contamination.The government then asked J&J to take over production at the plant. The plant also stopped making the AstraZeneca vaccine substance. After the plant’s production was stopped, the FDA returned to conduct several additional inspections at the facility, Emergent said. The company said it also has worked closely with the FDA and J&J to address quality concerns, and has developed an action plan going forward. “The American people should have high expectations of the partners its government chooses to help prepare them for disaster, and we have even higher expectations of ourselves,” Emergent CEO Robert Kramer said in a statement. “We have fallen short of those lofty ambitions over the past few months but resumption of manufacturing is a key milestone and we are grateful for the opportunity to help bring this global pandemic to an end. We’d like to thank our government partners as well as Johnson & Johnson for their support.” In an email to CNN, J&J confirmed the restart of production. “We will continue to work toward securing Emergency Use Authorization in the United States for drug substance manufactured at Emergent Bayview as quickly as possible,” a spokesperson from Johnson & Johnson said in the email. The FDA has been giving extra scrutiny to batches produced at the facility, which are shipped to other facilities to be put into vials and finished. On July 13, the FDA authorized the fifth batch of J&J vaccine to be shipped but did not note how many doses that equaled. ##Vaccines## Get the shot or take a hike. After months of reluctance, Corporate America is taking a stand on keeping its returning workers safe. A growing number of companies are requiring vaccines for employees and in some cases, for clients and customers.  Most companies are allowing for very rare religious and health exemptions, of course. But the ""I read something scary on Facebook"" excuse doesn't apply anymore. Silicon Valley is leading the way. Facebook and Google announced all employees returning to the office must be vaccinated. Netflix is the first studio to mandate the vaccine. All actors who star in the streaming giant's programming and the employees who come in contact with them must have the shot. Wall Street offices are filling up fast. And vaccines are required. The financial sector says get vaxxed or find a new job. BlackRock and Morgan Stanley announced all employees must be vaccinated to return to the office. It's a diverse list. Saks Fifth Avenue, the Washington Post, Ascension Health, and Lyft are also requiring the shot to work.  It's good business. Johnny Taylor, Jr, of the Society of Human Resource Management, says most employees want vaccine mandates. They want to know their workplace is safe when people return. His polling shows nearly 70% of employees want their colleagues to be vaccinated. And patience has worn thin with the vaccine-hesitant. ""You must be vaccinated if you want to come to work,"" he tells me. ""There are some organizations that are trying one more step before that. They're saying, if you choose not to be vaccinated, then you will have to be tested several times during the week on your own dime. And you will have to wear a mask in the workplace and not any mask, but that N95 surgical mask. I mean, we are going to, at the end of the day, make this a little uncomfortable for you because you're making it uncomfortable and the workplace less comfortable for your colleagues."" That's the case for MGM Grand. Unvaccinated workers must regularly test for the virus, and if found positive, they will quarantine — without pay. MGM Grand's CEO Bill Hornbuckle hasn't mandated the vaccine but has implored workers to get the shot, acknowledging the unvaccinated will hurt business. ""In addition to the heart-wrenching thought of more illness and death, I fear that progressively more restrictive measures, including a return to social distancing and capacity restrictions, could be around the corner if we continue on this path,"" Hornbuckle wrote in a letter to employees. That's the view from Union Square Hospitality CEO Danny Meyer. He told CNBC Thursday you can't have full restaurants again without mandates for employees and customers to be vaccinated. He's giving workers 45 days to get the shot. Even the Federal Reserve chief, Jerome Powell, says vaccinations are key to protect the economy from coronavirus variants. ""These strains — there is no reason they can't keep coming, and one more powerful than the next. We don't know that, but that's certainly a plausible outcome. As vaccinations rise we can nonetheless get back to our economic activity,"" Powell said Wednesday. The Delta variant of the virus has many companies tweaking their return to the office plans. Many had hoped to have employees back after Labor Day, now some are pushing back later into the fall. But they are signaling that vaccines will be required.  Plan accordingly. ##Vaccines## As vaccination rates have fallen across the US, President Biden has become increasingly frustrated and feels as if the nation has hit “a brick wall” when it comes to getting shots in arms, according to people familiar with his thinking.  Biden will give a speech Thursday announcing a new vaccine requirement for civilian federal employees, but one official says he also plans to directly address the millions who have procrastinated or outright refused to get vaccinated.  In private meetings with top aides, Biden has raised one question repeatedly: “What’s the problem?”  The President gets daily updates on vaccination rates, hospitalizations and deaths. Lately his briefings have focused on the formidable Delta variant, but advisers have also warned that if the vaccination issue doesn’t change soon, another — and potentially worse — variant could surface, further derailing progress the US has made.  One of the principal motivators behind Biden’s vaccine requirement for federal workers is providing a model for private companies and local governments considering similar rules for their own employees, according to administration officials.  While Biden hopes the steps he announces Thursday will lead to more federal workers getting shots, he views the broader goal of providing an example — and political and legal cover — to other employers as equally important.  The White House was still finalizing the parameters of the requirement on Wednesday, but specific implementation is expected to be left to individual agencies and departments. Biden’s announcement itself is likely to be quite broad, with the details left to those agencies to sort out. It’s possible different agencies have different requirements.  Officials wanted to announce the requirement before agencies and private businesses return their workforces to offices in the fall to give them time to implement the changes and to allow workers time to get fully vaccinated.  Administration officials were quietly pleased by how little pushback there was to the announcement by the Department of Veterans Affairs that they would require all healthcare workers to get vaccinated within the next eight weeks.  ##Vaccines## The US Food and Drug Administration insists it is working as quickly as possible to review applications for full approval of the Covid-19 vaccines as the number of cases continues to rise and vaccination rates decline across the country. Though the FDA has yet to disclose a time line for when its work will be done, medical experts and sources familiar with the process tell CNN that full approval could come within the next couple of months. While that would amount to a record fast pace, the urgency is rising for a fully approved vaccine given the troubling surge in Covid cases sweeping the country. An FDA official told CNN on Wednesday that the agency continues to work as fast as possible to review the applications. The official noted that as part of the emergency use authorization granted last year, the vaccines have already undergone a ""thorough scientific evaluation"" in order to ""meet FDA's rigorous standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality."" Still, federal medical officials and business leaders agree that full FDA approval would be helpful in the fight against vaccine hesitancy and would support companies eager to issue vaccine mandates to employees returning to the office. Where the process stands: The FDA should have all the paperwork and data from the vaccine trials from Pfizer and be in the reviewing process, medical experts said. In July, Pfizer announced that the FDA had granted its vaccine a priority review, accelerating the process from 10 months to six, meaning that technically approval should be granted by January. But the acting commissioner of the FDA, Dr. Janet Woodcock, has said the FDA intends to complete the review far in advance of its January deadline. Multiple officials told CNN the FDA is working nonstop to get through the review process and grant approval. Former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said on Wednesday that he believed the approval could come as early as next month. ""I long felt that the FDA would approve the vaccine probably within a three- to four-month time frame from when the application was submitted. Those applications were submitted about two and a half, three months ago. ... So I think that puts you on (an) end of August, September time frame in terms of when these are going to be approved."" Medical experts stressed that the vaccination approval process takes time, even for something as vital as Covid-19 vaccines.

It prompted officials to launch mass testing for more than 9 million residents starting July 21; a second round of mass testing was completed over the weekend, and a third round began on Wednesday. So far, at least 175 cases are connected to the airport cluster, which officials have linked to the more infectious Delta variant.  ""The recent spike in infections in the city can be attributed to the special location of the outbreak and the highly contagious nature of the (Delta) strain,"" said Ding Jie, vice director of Nanjing's center for disease control and prevention, at a news conference, state media reported Tuesday.  Despite the rapid and aggressive testing campaign, the virus appears to have already spread beyond Jiangsu province. China recorded 49 new cases on Wednesday, including 24 local infections from three additional provinces, according to the National Health Commission (NHC), taking the total number of cases associated with the new cluster to at least 175.  A second new case was reported in Beijing on Thursday afternoon, with health authorities describing the two local cases as a husband and wife who had recently traveled outside of the capital. Close contacts of the couple have been placed under quarantine.  Though the latest nationwide count marks a slight drop from the 86 cases recorded Tuesday – the highest single day increase since January – the virus' spread across provincial borders is sparking alarm among the country's leaders, after more than a year of low case numbers and resumed daily life. Some background: The coronavirus was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019, rapidly spreading across China and the world. Yet despite being the first country to succumb to the virus, China has since managed to successfully contain its spread. Since March 2020, the official case figures have remained low, and occasional flare-ups have been quickly contained with mass testing and severe restrictions, including mass lockdowns of hundreds of millions of people across the country. The current outbreak, however, poses a new threat, with the more transmissible Delta variant identified in the eastern city of Nanjing, capital of Jiangsu province and a major industrial and transport hub home to more than 9.3 million people. It will also be a test of the efficacy of China's massive vaccination program, which has administered more than 1.5 billion doses so far – a scale and speed unrivaled by any other country in the world. Other countries in the region, including Thailand and Australia, have also been hit by the Delta variant and are currently battling outbreaks. But these countries have also struggled with a slow vaccination rollout beset by delays and shortages. This is in sharp contrast to China, which is on track to reach its goal of achieving so-called ""herd immunity"" – the point at which enough people have either been infected or vaccinated to end community transmission – by December this year. President Biden will announce on Thursday a requirement that all federal employees and contractors be vaccinated against Covid-19, or be required to submit to regular testing and mitigation requirements, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter. The announcement will come in remarks today at 4:00 p.m. ET. Biden is also expected to lay out a series of new steps, including incentives, in an attempt to spur new vaccinations as the Delta variant spreads rapidly throughout the country. It will also follow the decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs to require its frontline health care workers to be vaccinated over the course of the next two months. Biden alluded to the looming announcement on Tuesday. ""That's under consideration right now,"" Biden said, when asked if he would impose a vaccination mandate on federal workers. More on the announcement: While the specifics are still being finalized, the source said, federal workers would be required to attest to their vaccination status or submit to regular testing. The source said the proposal will be roughly similar to what is being implemented in New York City. Additional requirements for the unvaccinated could be added as agencies push to vaccinate their employees. Biden will not impose the requirement on the US military, despite his authority to do so, for the time being. He is, however, likely to outline how the Department of Defense may seek to approach the issue going forward, the source said.

Global phone hacks expose darker side of Israel's 'startup nation' image,2021-07-25,"Audacious Mossad spy operations around the world. The plucky ""startup nation"" home to reams of billion-dollar ideas. These are two drivers of Israel's image abroad that its political and business leaders have long been happy to push. That slick image appears to have taken a hit with new reports that once again Israeli-founded technology, like the Pegasus software from the firm NSO, has been used by governments around the world to allegedly hack the cellphones of human rights activists, journalists and others.  NSO and its defenders say its software is meant only to catch terrorists and other criminals, saying it regularly saves lives and operates under strict export controls. The company says it doesn't control what its clients do with the software, but follows Israeli laws on exporting military-grade technology, is selective in vetting its customers and cuts off access if it discovers misuse.  But the recent revelations by an international consortium of media and human rights groups about Pegasus, have thrown the spotlight back on both the company and Israel. Now, as many consider the morality and legality of such programs, there are calls from both inside Israel as well as in the international community about how better to regulate the cyber-espionage market.  A perfect marriage of spycraft and technology Israel's dominance in the cybersecurity field did not occur in a vacuum.  The country's intelligence and covert operations divisions, especially its Mossad security force, have long had a storied reputation for engaging in cunning, daring and ruthless espionage, burnished by Hollywood depictions. As Israel's prominence as a hub of technological innovation and startup grew, the two areas converged to give the tiny country an outsized influence in the cybersecurity industry.   The country's well-resourced education system, plus the compulsory military service, brings scores of young Israelis into high-level training in cybersecurity and cyberwarfare before many of them even go to university, according to Tal Pavel, Head of Cybersecurity studies at The Academic College of Tel-Aviv Yaffo. Much of the country's most cutting-edge technology has its roots in military development, Pavel noted.  One of the most elite units of the Israel Defense Forces is the secretive Unit 8200, the cyber spy agency that has produced some of the country's biggest tech super stars. ""One of the unique things in Israel, is the 'cynergy,' the bringing together of cyber and synergy between industries,"" Pavel told CNN, before alluding to a characteristic he says is perhaps rooted in the Israeli psyche.  ""There is also something here ... maybe there is also the struggle to survive. If everything is happy and you're not constantly trying to survive (against people trying to destroy you), you don't have to innovate, to cope."" NSO fallout NSO was founded in 2009, but it wasn't until 2016 that the power of NSO's technology came under scrutiny. It was in that year that reports emerged that Emirati human rights activist Ahmed Mansoor received suspicious text messages with links, that researchers at Citizen Lab in the University of Toronto revealed contained malware from NSO that would have hacked his iPhone. (In 2018 Mansoor was sentenced to 10 years in prison for ""damaging the reputation"" of the UAE on social media.) Pegasus software was also allegedly connected to the 2018 murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi via fellow dissident Omar Abdulaziz, whose phone was allegedly hacked through Pegasus software. Abdulaziz sued NSO in 2019, accusing the company of violating international law by selling the software to oppressive regimes. Early last year an Israeli judged rejected NSO's request to dismiss the lawsuit, which NSO had argued was lacking ""good faith,"" according to The Guardian. NSO has repeatedly denied its software was used to monitor Khashoggi or his family. The recent investigation by the international media and human rights consortium found evidence of Pegasus software on 37 phones belonging to people who, based on the company's own description of the software's purpose, shouldn't have been targets of NSO software, like journalists and human rights activists. CNN has not independently verified the findings of that investigation, named Pegasus Project, which was organized by Forbidden Stories. In a statement to CNN, NSO strongly denied the investigation's findings saying it found fault with many of its assertions. As a result, countries like France have announced probes into the use of the technology, while Amazon announced they had ""shut down the relevant infrastructure and accounts"" linked to NSO that used Amazon services.  Tip of the iceberg NSO is simply one part of a vast industry of cyber espionage, according to Israel Bachar, a strategy and communications consultant who has worked with many of Israel's top political leaders, including former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and current Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Benny Gantz.  ""Let's be honest, intelligence is being gathered by states against each other constantly. Everyone spies on everyone. And when it comes to an Israeli company there's a lot of hypocrisy,"" Bachar said, pointing to previous revelations about the US National Security Agency spying on world leaders and its own citizens. ""NSO is another tool but there are many other tools.""  Beyond its actual capabilities, companies like NSO also help Israel diplomatically, Bachar said, as Israel has for years quietly, and now publicly, cultivated relationships with former adversaries.  ""One of the tools that Israel uses diplomatically is its ability in intelligence. It's not a secret that Israel is sharing sensitive intelligence even with Arab countries because we have an interest in protecting them,"" Bachar said.   But Professor Yuval Shany, chair of the public international law department at Hebrew University of Jerusalem, says the tactic is starting to backfire on Israel's image.   ""The logic is Israel may be willing to turn a blind eye to transactions that are conducted with friendly regimes in the sense that they are friendly to Israel but not necessarily friendly to human rights,"" Shany said. ""I think this recent scandal, which is quite embarrassing both for NSO but also for Israel, would lead at least in the short run to some tightening of export controls standards.""  How to control the uncontrollable Unlike conventional weapons, software is often intangible and can easily be sold and transferred across the globe, making attempts to control technology like the Pegasus system difficult.   NSO and similar military-grade technology is regulated by an export control structure within Israel's Ministry of Defense, Shany said. This system looks both at the technology and the target; which entity -- either state or non-state -- is purchasing this technology including its human rights record, he added. But, Shany said, looking at the allegations around NSO's Pegasus software, ""the results are not impressive, it's quite concerning."" In response to the most recent allegations around NSO technology, Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz said they are ""studying"" the claims, while an interministerial team has been appointed to look into the current process and whether Israeli-made technology was being misused abroad, according to Reuters. A quick fix, Shany said, would be for Israel to formally sign onto the Wassenaar Arrangement between 42 countries, which tries to bring transparency to the export of military and dual-use technology and attempts to prevent such technology from being acquired by dangerous elements. Shany said Israel currently adheres to the agreement but is not a formal member.    But the most important reforms to help controlling such technology will come from within, said Karine Nahon, a professor at the Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya and President of the Israel Internet Association.  ""If Israel doesn't export it someone else would, if you don't give those engineers and startup licenses and provide a kind of supervision nothing stops them from moving to another country and selling it from there,"" she said.   Nahon is calling for the ethical consideration and the possibility such technology will be exploited to become a more significant part an export decision. And, she suggested, the companies should place more limitations on the software's use and have more oversight into how their clients are using the software -- something NSO says it has little control over. ""NSO does not operate the system and has no visibility to the data,"" the company said in a statement last week, saying it will continue to investigate ""all credible claims of misuse and take appropriate action based on the results"" of such investigations. ""It makes it more complicated in terms of the responsibility of these companies and Israel but on the other hand it might minimize the number of countries this software is being exported to,"" Nahon said.  Even though it may seem like NSO and Israel's image is being dragged through the mud for its connection to such alarming surveillance, Bachar said overall it could have a positive effect for those who want to continue burnishing Israel as a leader in advanced technology and intelligence operations.  ""I think sometimes people come to curse and the outcome is there is a blessing because what happened at the end of the day, people remember that the best technology is Israeli technology, NSO,"" Bachar said. ""That's what people three months from now will remember.""","{'neg': 0.138, 'neu': 0.862, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.1531}",55,111.0,0.0,0.934,0.066,0.3182,0.075,0.817,0.108,0.9944,17.500999999999998,38.641325,549.0,0.07038492714025502
A fragile status quo on prayer rights at Jerusalem holy site comes under fresh strain,2021-07-20,"The scenes of Israeli forces firing stun grenades and tear gas inside Jerusalem's Al Aqsa mosque earlier this year had a galvanizing effect on Palestinian public opinion.  It also gave the militant group Hamas what it saw as a convincing pretext for launching rockets against Israel, leading to a bloody 11-day conflict and a reminder of the powerful interplay between religious and nationalist dynamics at one of the world's most contentious holy sites.  This week things threatened to escalate there again, this time over the issue of Jewish prayer.  Ever since Israel captured Jerusalem's Old City from Jordan in 1967, a delicate status quo has existed at a complex known to Muslims as the Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary) and to Jews as the Temple Mount. It is the holiest site in Judaism and, as the home of the Al Aqsa mosque, the third holiest site in Islam. The agreement in place since 1967 allows anybody to visit the site, but only Muslims to pray.  On Sunday, about 1,600 religious Jews went to Temple Mount for Tisha B'Av, a day of fasting to mark the destruction of the first and second temples in ancient times.  Video cameras appeared to catch some of the visitors praying.  Rather than calling them out, or overlooking the apparent transgression, Israel's new right-wing Prime Minister Naftali Bennett appeared to lean in unequivocally.  In a statement released toward the end of the day, Bennett thanked police and officials for ""managing the events ... with responsibility and consideration, while maintaining freedom of worship for Jews on the Mount.""  Those last 10 words rang out like a siren, a direct challenge to the established order of things.  Asked by CNN whether Bennett's comments represented a policy shift, an official at the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) insisted there was ""no change in the status quo regarding the Temple Mount. Everything remains as it was.""  Somewhat bafflingly, the official added, ""the press release referred to the freedom to visit,"" but then declined to comment further when pressed on the fact the statement did not in fact make such a reference.  On Monday morning, more than 12 hours later and following an official protest from Jordan, which has custodianship rights at the site, there was a further update.  Unnamed officials in the PMO were quoted in Israeli media saying that whatever the statement might have said, what Bennett meant was that Jews have visitation rights at the Mount.  Even so, days after they were first published, the original comments remained unchanged on the Prime Minister's official Twitter page.  Palestinians say it was no slip of the tongue, but rather another step in a deliberate long-term process.  ""It is gradual encroachment, gradually they have been creating facts, allowing more and more visitors, provoking Palestinians, Muslim worshipers, gradually changing the status quo step by step,"" said former Palestine Liberation Organization Executive Committee member Hanan Ashrawi.  For many Palestinians, other events around the mosque compound on Sunday reinforced the widely held sense that Israel believes it can act with impunity towards them.  They pointed to videos showing Israeli border police in riot gear firing towards the mosque building at sunrise, causing damage to one of its prayer halls.  Or other footage from later in the day showing police forcing Muslim worshipers, some of them women, off the compound.  All of this comes around Eid al-Adha, one of the most important holidays in the Islamic calendar, marking the end of the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia.  The Jordanian-run waqf, or Islamic trust, which administers the Haram al-Sharif, pulled no punches in a statement, accusing the Israeli government and police of allowing ""groups of extremists Jews to storm the mosque and provocatively pray and make public rituals in the compound.""  The growing sense that more and more religious Jews are now worshiping openly at the holy site was given support by a report over the weekend on Israel's Channel 12, which broadcast footage of Jewish prayer sessions and Torah lessons it said were being held there daily. The report showed worshipers praying in full view of Israeli police, who simply looked on or looked away, and described developments as ""a revolution that is being conducted quietly and gradually beneath the radar."" Daniel Seidemann, an expert on Israel-Palestinian relations in the city who advises international officials on Jerusalem issues, says Israel's Prime Minister is ""playing with matches.""  ""When you say, 'right of Jewish prayer at the Temple Mount' you have changed the status quo,"" Seidemann said, adding that Bennett's original words gave ""the stamp of approval to a highly problematic erosion [of the status quo] that has taken place over the last few years.""  The Jerusalem expert added that Bennett's comments could also raise alarms for US President Joe Biden's administration which wants to achieve an improvement in Israel's relations with Jordan -- seen as damaged by previous longtime Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu -- and which believes reinforcing the status quo is an important way to do that.  The propensity of events at Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif to trigger more serious escalations has been a common theme in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.   In 1990, at least 17 Palestinians died in clashes after a renewed attempt by a group called the Temple Mount Faithful to lay the cornerstone of a third temple.    Ten years later, a visit to the site by Israel's Ariel Sharon is widely seen as being the spark that set off the Second Intifada. But Seidemann believes without the status quo things would have been far worse.  That simple arrangement, he said, has in the main allowed Jerusalem ""an element of stability that keeps periodic eruptions of violence as just that: periodic eruptions.""

Blinken meets Israel's new foreign minister who vows to fix mistakes,2021-06-27,"When US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid in Rome, the Israeli foreign minister pledged to fix the politicized relationship between the two countries, even as he cited ""serious reservations"" over the Biden administration's efforts to salvage the Iran nuclear deal. ""Israel has some serious reservations about the Iran nuclear deal that is being put together in Vienna,"" Lapid said on Sunday. ""We believe the way to discuss those disagreements is through direct and professional conversations, not in press conferences."" The meeting comes as the Biden administration's indirect talks with Tehran to salvage the Iran nuclear deal -- which Israel continues to staunchly oppose -- are set to enter a 7th round after the Iranian presidential election. The two countries agreed to get their Iran experts together for a briefing where the US would update Israel on the Iran deal talks, according to senior State Department officials. During this first meeting between a Biden Cabinet official and Israeli leadership since the new Israeli government came into office earlier this month, Lapid pledged to fix how politicized the Israeli-US relationship had become in recent years during the tenure of former President Donald Trump and former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. ""There is no relationship more important to Israel than the United States of America. There is no more loyal friend of the United States of America than Israel. In the past few years, mistakes were made. Israeli's bipartisan standing was hurt,"" Lapid said as the two leaders gave opening remarks before their meeting, adding, ""We will fix those mistakes together."" Blinken -- sitting down with his counterpart who has been in the job for fewer than three weeks -- acknowledged that they are delving into a new chapter of the relationship, but one with a deep past. ""Even though our situation is relatively new -- the foundation that we are working on is one of an enduring partnership, relationship, friendship, between the US and Israel and it is based, as the foreign minister said, on a set of shared values and shared interests,"" Blinken said. The meeting comes about a month after President Joe Biden and his national security team were involved in a behind-the-scenes diplomatic effort with the Israelis, the Palestinians and other countries in the region earlier this year that resulted in a ceasefire to end an 11-day conflict between Israel and Hamas. But those talks were with Netanyahu's government -- before Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett took office. Blinken's meeting with Lapid officially launched the relationship between the Biden and Bennett governments. Lapid will be someone with whom the Biden administration will grow quite familiar in the coming years. While Lapid is currently serving as foreign minister, he will take the reins from Bennett to serve as prime minister in two years, as part of the coalition government agreement. One primary issue that the leaders focused on was the urgent need for humanitarian assistance and reconstruction in Gaza, according to senior State Department officials. Blinken also addressed the flashpoint issues that could spark another conflict, such as Temple Mount.   And while differences were discussed -- including Blinken making clear US concerns about Israeli demolitions in East Jerusalem -- the officials described the overall meeting as ""warm"" and ""constructive."" Blinken said that the Biden administration ""strongly supports"" the Abraham Accords -- which were hatched during the Trump administration -- but also said that ""as important as they are, as vital as they are, they are not a substitute for engaging on the issues"" between the Israelis and the Palestinians that need to be resolved. Blinken said that there is work that needs to be done on offering a ""more hopeful future"" for Israelis and Palestinians. The Biden administration has not committed to any near-term effort to launch peace negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians, with the focus in the aftermath of the recent Israeli-Hamas crisis focused on getting humanitarian assistance to the region. The Biden administration has taken steps to nurture the US diplomatic relationship with the Palestinians after it was cut under Trump, who nurtured a deep relationship with Netanyahu and brokered normalization agreements between Israel and Gulf Arab nations. Biden officials have revived the Palestinian relationship and, in addition to reinstating millions in US funding for the Palestinians, are planning to reopen the US consulate in Jerusalem, which Trump had closed. Yet as the Biden administration delves into engagements with both the Palestinians and the Israelis, the prospect for peace in the region remains incredibly low. After the recent violence in Gaza, Blinken said that ""there has to be"" a prospect for movement toward a genuine political solution. ""I think both sides are reminded that we have to find a way to break the cycle, because if we don't, it will repeat itself at great cost and at great human suffering on all sides,"" the secretary of state said in May. ""As the President said, I think it's incumbent upon all of us to try to make the turn to start to build something more positive."" Blinken, who said the short-term focus is on the humanitarian crisis in the region, did not detail future efforts by the Biden administration to kick start a peace process. And other senior Biden administration officials have said that they do not want to lay down ""unachievable objectives"" and ""waste time"" pursing those goals.","{'neg': 0.2, 'neu': 0.8, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.3612}",31,113.0,0.016333333333333335,0.9253333333333332,0.057999999999999996,0.6486,0.054,0.832,0.114,0.9958,20.1066,35.4392,536.0,0.06611791044776119
Palestinians demand end to Abbas presidency after activist dies during 'brutal beating and arrest',2021-06-25,"Large demonstrations are being held across the West Bank calling for an end to the Palestinian Authority (PA) and the Presidency of Mahmoud Abbas, after the funeral of Palestinian activist Nizar Banat, who died while in the custody of PA security forces on Thursday morning. The body of Banat, 45, was borne aloft through the streets of Hebron where he lived, following a funeral ceremony at the mosque. Crowds, estimated by CNN at 15,000 in number, walked behind the body waving Palestinian flags, proclaiming him a martyr. People chanted, ""Abu Mazen is a traitor"" -- referring to Abbas by the common Arabic kunya ""Abu"" meaning ""father of"" -- and ""The people say, 'Down with the Authority!'"" Many of the mourners also carried the green flag of Hamas, the Islamist group that runs Gaza, and one of Abbas's main political rivals. Anti-PA protests have also been held in Ramallah and in Jerusalem's Old City outside the al Aqsa mosque. Banat was a well-known and outspoken critic of Abbas and the PA, using social media to denounce PA leaders for alleged corruption and incompetence. One of his last posts on Facebook slammed the PA over its botched swap deal with Israel for 1 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine for coronavirus. He was arrested in the early hours of Thursday in an operation involving about 20 armed officers, his family told CNN, during which he was brutally beaten, the family said. A preliminary autopsy report released by the Ramallah-based Independent Commission for Human Rights with the blessing of Banat's family, described injuries ""in the form of bruises and abrasions in many areas of the body, including the head, neck, shoulders, chest, back, upper and lower limbs, with cuffing marks on the wrists and rib fractures."" The report said initial autopsy results indicated an ""abnormal"" death but said determining the main cause of death would need the results of laboratory tissue tests. Hebron Governor Jibreen Al Bakri said Banat had died after ""his health deteriorated"" during the arrest, which he said had been ordered by the PA's Attorney General. The PA has said it will launch an inquiry into what happened. Standing with his grandfather outside the mosque Friday before the funeral ceremony, Nizar's 6-year-old son, Kifah, told CNN, ""I heard from my mother that they assassinated my father. They attacked and killed him, and I don't know why."" Jihad Al Khatib, an older resident of the city, told CNN there was no doubt why Banat had been targeted by the PA. ""He is the one that speaks against the oppressor, and for the oppressed ... They killed the hope in us. They killed him after he exposed their corruption,"" he said. Banat's death has drawn responses from across the international community. The US State department said in a statement it was ""deeply disturbed"" by the death and urged the PA ""to conduct a thorough and transparent investigation and to ensure full accountability in this case."" The statement went on: ""We have serious concerns about Palestinian Authority restrictions on the exercise of freedom of expression by Palestinians and harassment of civil society activists and organizations."" Human rights groups have been concerned for years about what they say is the growing authoritarianism of the PA under President Abbas. In particular, they are concerned by the 2017 ""Law on Electronic Crimes"" which allows ""arbitrary restrictions on the rights to freedom of expression, privacy and protection of data,"" according to Human Rights Watch. Banat himself was arrested under that law last November and spent several days in detention after posting a video on social media sharply criticizing the PA leadership for the resumption of its policy of security coordination with Israeli forces. That policy, which sees PA security forces often working closely with Israeli security in the West Bank, had been suspended by Abbas over the threat of annexation by Israel's government led by then-Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Over the years, though, Abbas has generally stuck hard to the policy, under pressure from key international supporters like the United States, the United Kingdom and others, which have been heavily involved in training PA security forces. Palestinians often see security coordination as assisting Israel in its military occupation of their land, and people in Hebron expressed anger at what they said must have been cooperation with Israel in the operation which resulted in Banat's death. ""This is a crime in all aspects,"" Mazeed Saqf Al-Hait from Nablus told CNN. ""The PA is the main suspect in this crime. Israel is a suspect as a partner in this crime because [the PA arrest operation] requires security coordination. Also, the US and the EU are partners in the crime through their financial support to the security forces. It is the system that is criminal and is responsible for the killing and should be held accountable."" The death comes less than two months after President Abbas canceled elections for the Palestinian Legislative Council, which have not been held since 2006, in a move which drew widespread criticism from many Palestinians. Mustafa Barghouti, a long-time independent politician and human rights activist, told CNN Banat's death is an extremely damaging moment for the Palestinian Authority. ""It proves that we cannot go on without democratic elections, without legislative authority, without independent judiciary and without separation of powers. Palestine needs more than a security system that is unable to protect its people from Israeli attacks. Palestine needs democracy and elections immediately,"" he said.

Palestinians cancel Pfizer vaccine agreement with Israel,2021-06-19,"The Palestinian Authority has canceled an agreement with Israel that was to have seen at least 1 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine for Covid-19 transferred to the West Bank and Gaza.  The abrupt turnaround came after health officials in Ramallah inspected the first delivery of almost 90,000 doses Friday afternoon, the Palestinian Health Minister said.  ''It was found that the doses did not conform to the technical specifications as previously agreed upon, and that their expiry date was close,'' minister Mai Alkaila said, according to the official Palestinian news agency Wafa.  ''Hence, we reached out to Prime Minister Muhammad Shtayyeh, and a decision was made to cancel the deal,"" Alkaila added. The move to transfer Israel's surplus stock of Pfizer vaccines to Palestinians in the occupied territories, an arrangement already in the works under the previous Netanyahu administration, according to Israeli media reports, was announced Friday morning by the Israeli government.  A government statement had acknowledged the vaccines ""will expire soon"" but it was not clear exactly how much time remained for Palestinian health authorities to administer the doses before expiration.  According to Reuters, Alkaila said Israel had told the PA the vaccines expired in July or August, but it turned out the true date was June.  As part of the agreed arrangement, a shipment of Pfizer vaccines intended for the PA later in the year was to have been transferred to Israel instead. The PA says it is now calling on Pfizer to speed up that shipment to Palestinians, as per the original contract. Israel's leaders won considerable international acclaim for the country's highly successful rollout of Covid-19 vaccinations to its population of 9 million earlier in the year.  But they were criticized for failing to provide vaccines to cover Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza, which under the Geneva Conventions Israel is obliged to do.  Israel argued that it was relieved of those obligations by the Oslo Accords, signed by Israeli and Palestinian leaders in the 1990s, which allocate responsibility for medical care provision to the Palestinian Authority. Almost 450,000 Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza have received a Covid-19 vaccine so far, according to PA figures, of whom just over 270,000 have received two doses. The two territories have a population of between 4.5 million and 5 million people.","{'neg': 0.196, 'neu': 0.49, 'pos': 0.314, 'compound': 0.296}",14,115.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.037,0.878,0.085,0.9578,0.0,21.384800000000002,170.0,0.1257929411764706
Why balloons strapped to explosives are the latest flashpoint in Israel-Hamas tensions,2021-06-16,"The Israeli military launched airstrikes against Hamas targets in Gaza overnight after militants floated dozens of so-called ""incendiary balloons"" over the border fence into Israel.  Officials said at least 20 fires were started Tuesday by the balloons. Palestinian media reported the retaliatory Israeli strikes caused material damages, with no casualties reported.  More balloons were launched Wednesday, starting at least four more fires, Israeli fire and rescue authorities said. While militants have been sending balloons into Israel for years, the Israeli military's response of airstrikes in Gaza is a new escalation. Israeli officials said it was part of a message to Hamas that any provocation will be met with force.                                                                Former finance minister Israel Katz, who was in the cabinet during the most recent conflict with Gaza last month, said that after that operation, ""we decided to change the rules.""  ""For every attack in Israel, targeted assassinations and widespread attacks on Hamas targets will be carried out,"" he tweeted.  Here's what we know about the balloons and how they play into the current tensions.  What are incendiary balloons? They're relatively simple contraptions -- helium balloons that often look like children's birthday party decorations, attached to explosives or devices that are pre-emptively lit on fire.  Militants launch the balloons from Gaza and winds from the Mediterranean Sea help propel them into Israeli territory.   What are they designed to do?  The balloons are designed to frighten, cause damage, and start fires. Much of the land immediately surrounding Gaza are fields, nature reserves or farmland. Other than explosives attached to the devices potentially landing in residential areas and causing injuries or damage, the fires from the balloons burn crops and nature reserves.  Since 2018, more than 10,400 acres have been burned in Israel from flying incendiary devices, not including Tuesday's fires, an Israel Defense Forces spokesperson said. So far authorities have not reported any casualties from such incendiary devices.   Why balloons instead of rockets this time? The balloons are a cheap way for militant groups in Gaza to send a message to Israel, without provoking the full Israeli military retaliation that often occurs when rockets are fired from the coastal enclave.   The balloons are easily constructed and require little set up to launch, compared to rockets which are expensive and time-consuming to produce. So far, the balloons rarely if ever cause injuries.  Tuesday's balloons were likely floated in response to the Israeli government's decision to allow a provocative right-wing flag march to proceed in Jerusalem.  The flag march is an annual parade where mostly nationalist Jewish groups walk through the Old City of Jerusalem carrying Israeli flags to celebrate Israel gaining control of the Western Wall during the 1967 Six-Day War. The march often sparks tensions with Palestinian residents of the Old City.  On Tuesday, 33 Palestinian protesters were injured, including by stun grenade, rubber bullets and live fire -- with six evacuated to hospital -- following clashes with Israeli security forces around east Jerusalem, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society said. In a statement on Tuesday, Hamas claimed victory, saying their tactics and Palestinian demonstrators in Jerusalem had forced Israeli officials to change the path of the flag parade and take other precautionary measures.  Where does Israel's new leader stand on balloons?   In the past, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett had pushed former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to take a tougher stance against Hamas and the launching of incendiary balloons, saying the Israeli military should respond to them in the same way as it responds to rockets directed at Israeli communities. After last month's 11-day conflict, Israeli officials indicated such acts like incendiary balloons would be met with greater force, something that appears to now be happening.  In 2018 while serving as education minister, Bennett said the military should ""shoot to kill"" anyone who sends such incendiary devices over the border fence.  This story has been updated.","{'neg': 0.197, 'neu': 0.803, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.4019}",32,116.0,0.0,0.964,0.036,0.1779,0.097,0.847,0.056,-0.9851,5.6928,9.576600000000004,147.0,0.06514693877551024
Israeli military launches airstrikes in Gaza in response to incendiary balloons launched from the coastal enclave,2021-06-16,"The Israeli military struck targets in Gaza overnight Wednesday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement, citing incendiary balloons launched from Gaza earlier in the day. According to reports in Israeli media, incendiary balloons launched from Gaza sparked multiple fires in southern Israel.  WAFA, the official Palestinian News Agency also reported the airstrikes in Khan Younis and said ""material"" damage occurred. The news agency also reported on another site south of Gaza City being targeted and said there were no casualties from both incidents. The airstrikes are the first in Gaza since a ceasefire went into effect nearly one month ago. The IDF said it struck Hamas military complexes and meeting places for the Khan Younis and Gaza brigades. The helium-filled balloons, which were affixed with incendiary devices, were floated into Israel on Wednesday both before and after the airstrikes. The IDF says the balloons were launched as a protest to the provocative flag march in Jerusalem, where thousands of Israelis marched through the Old City. Far-right Jewish extremists taking part in the parade chanted ""Death to Arabs"" and ""This is our home."" Israeli police in riot gear blocked surrounding streets, forcibly removing Palestinian protesters from the route.   Thirty-three Palestinian protesters were injured, including by stun grenade, rubber bullets and live fire, with six evacuated to hospital, following clashes with Israeli security forces around east Jerusalem, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society said. The march was seen as the first major test for Israel's new government, led by right-wing Prime Minister Naftali Bennett. In the past, Bennett had pushed former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to take a tougher stance against Hamas and the launching of incendiary balloons according to Israeli media. After the Israeli airstrikes, Hamas spokesperson Hazem Kassem said on Twitter, ""The Zionist bombing of the Gaza Strip is a failed attempt to stop our people's solidarity and resistance with the Holy City, and to cover up the unprecedented state of confusion for the Zionist establishment in organizing the so-called 'flag-march.' "" Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza did not immediately respond with rocket fire into Israel, but the situation along the Israel-Gaza border remains extremely tense, and the possibility of an imminent and serious escalation cannot be ruled out.  Eleven days of war Wednesday's airstrikes come a month after the worst violence in years between Israel and Hamas.  Over 11 days from May 10, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) carried out a devastating aerial bombardment of Gaza, while the Palestinian militant group Hamas fired thousands of rockets into Israel.  Israeli strikes during the recent conflict killed at least 248 Palestinians, including 66 children, according to Hamas health officials. At least 12 people in Israel, including two children, were killed by Palestinian militant fire from Gaza, according to Israel's military and the emergency service. A ceasefire was agreed on May 21 and followed a whirlwind of diplomatic attempts to push for an end to the hostilities.  The recent fighting between Israel and Hamas erupted after weeks of tension in Jerusalem, where a group of Palestinian families faced eviction from their homes in East Jerusalem in favor of Jewish nationalists. In addition, during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, there were a series of incidents which Palestinians saw as highly provocative, including the closing of a popular meeting place near the Old City, and the entrance of Israeli police into the Al Aqsa mosque on a number of occasions. There were regular clashes in and around the mosque compound during which police fired stun grenades and rubber coated bullets while Palestinians threw stones. Hundreds of Palestinians and some Israeli police officers were injured in the unrest.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.909, 'pos': 0.091, 'compound': 0.128}",24,117.0,0.0,0.939,0.061,0.1779,0.16,0.806,0.034,-0.9981,4.2696000000000005,15.600600000000005,137.0,0.11387299270072997
"What you need to know about Israel's new Prime Minister, Naftali Bennett",2021-06-14,"After four elections in two years, and with the country trapped in an agonizing parliamentary stalemate, Naftali Bennett appeared to be on the outside looking in, unable to reach the levers of power in Israeli politics.   Having failed to cross the electoral threshold in the first election in April 2019, his right-wing party had a mere seven seats following the latest election.   And yet Bennett is now Israel's Prime Minister.  The former tech entrepreneur who entered politics to serve then-opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu as chief of staff, ousted his old boss on Sunday, bringing an end to Netanyahu's run as the country's prime minister after more than 12 consecutive years in office, and starting a new -- if still uncertain -- era in Israel.  Bennett won a confidence vote with the narrowest of margins, just 60 votes to 59, and will lead the most diverse coalition Israel has ever seen, including the first Arab party to serve in the government. In his speech before the Knesset confidence vote, Bennett celebrated that diversity and warned of polarization within the country.  ""Twice in history, we have lost our national home precisely because the leaders of the generation were not able to sit with one and another and compromise. Each was right, yet with all their being right, they burnt the house down on top of us,"" Bennett said in a speech before his swearing in. ""I am proud of the ability to sit together with people with very different views from my own."" Few Israelis voted for Bennett's Yamina party in March's elections; he picked up just 7 seats, compared to Netanyahu's 30. But Bennett found himself wooed by both Netanyahu and centrist leader Yair Lapid in their efforts to form a parliamentary majority.   Now Bennett will hold the country's top job for two years, before handing over to Lapid.   The two men's partnership is an unlikely one, and Bennett will sit alongside politicians with completely opposing ideologies to his own in government. But as Lapid and Bennett sat next to each other in the government's first cabinet meeting late Sunday night, Lapid said it was based on mutual trust and friendship.  The two formed a political brotherhood in 2013, and it has re-emerged to lead the country into a new era of politics.  Bennett lies to the ideological right of Netanyahu in several crucial areas and carries into office a history of incendiary remarks about Palestinians and a well-documented ambition to annex part of the occupied West Bank.  How much of his agenda Bennett can achieve while constrained in an awkwardly assembled coalition remains to be seen. But the Yamina leader -- for so long a supporting character in Israel's high-stakes political spectacle -- is placed to become a major player on the world scene.  Staunch critic of two-state solution  Born in Haifa to immigrants from San Francisco, Bennett served in an elite unit of the Israel Defense Forces, before studying law at Hebrew University. He then became an entrepreneur, launching a tech start-up in 1999 which he later sold for $145 million.   He entered Israeli politics under Netanyahu's wing years later, though the two fell out after he was dismissed as chief of staff in 2008.   Bennett made his own name nationally in 2013 as the leader of the pro-settler party Jewish Home, making his desire to prevent the formation of a Palestinian state a central plank of his pitch to voters. After a merger with another party, he rebranded the party ""Yamina"" in 2019.  Bennett held several posts in Netanyahu's various governments, including as minister of defense, while continuing to outflank Netanyahu on issues relating to the Palestinian territories.  ""The old models of peace between Israel and the Palestinians are no longer relevant. The time has come to rethink the two-state solution,"" he wrote in a 2014 op-ed in the New York Times.  ""The era of these negotiations is over,"" he told CNN the same year. ""The approach that we've been trying for twenty years now clearly has reached its end.""  He has consistently held firm to his opposition to a two-state resolution since then, citing security and ideological concerns.  The international community, including the United States, is pushing for the renewal of a peace process between the Israelis and Palestinians, but this government is ill-equipped to handle such negotiations, since two of the parties are vocally opposed to the establishment of a Palestinian state.   In 2018, Bennett said that if he were defense minister, he would enact a ""shoot to kill"" policy on the border with Gaza. Asked if that would apply to children breaching the barrier, the Times of Israel reported that he replied: ""They are not children -- they are terrorists. We are fooling ourselves.""   During the most recent conflict between Israel and Hamas-led militants in Gaza, Bennett said the Palestinians could have turned Gaza ""into a paradise.""   ""They decided to turn it into a terrorist state,"" Bennett told CNN's Becky Anderson last month, before a ceasefire was agreed. ""The moment they decide that they don't want to annihilate us, this all ends.""  Unlikely bedfellows Bennett has railed against government regulation of the private sector and labor unions.   ""If there is one thing I would want to achieve over the next four years, it is to break up the monopolies here and to break the stranglehold the big unions have on the Israeli economy,"" he told the Guardian in 2013.   On a handful of other issues, he is considered comparatively liberal. Despite his religious background, during the most recent electoral campaign he said that gay people should ""fully have all the civil rights a straight person in Israel has,"" the Times of Israel reported -- though he also said that didn't mean he would take action to ensure legal equality.  Bennett has become a right-wing thorn in Netanyahu's side, fiercely criticizing his handling of the pandemic as well as the country's interminable political deadlock.  Bennett told CNN last month that, compared to his time in the tech sector and in the military, Israel's politics was ""quite a mess.""  Bennett's government will focus on domestic issues during his two years as prime minister, before he hands the reins to Lapid according to their coalition agreement.  These will include the relationship between religion and state, the cost of living, and quality of life issues. Israel also has not passed a budget since March 2018; the newly anointed government has three months to enact one or the Knesset will automatically dissolve and the country will once again head to an election.  He will be watched closely by a familiar foe. Netanyahu, once considered a ""magician"" of the country's political scene, warned during Sunday's swearing-in debate that he would remain a force in Parliament. ""We'll be back soon,"" he told lawmakers, after claiming that the new government would not stand up to Iran.  How much of his personal ideology Bennett can now enact as prime minister is an open question, but he has already made clear that compromise will form an important part of the government's ability to function.  ""The government that will be formed represents many of Israel's citizens: from Ofra to Tel Aviv, from Rahat to Kiryat Shmona. Precisely here lies the opportunity,"" Bennett said on Sunday. ""Our principle is: We will sit together, and we will forge forward on that which we agree -- and there is much we agree on, transport, education and so on -- and what separates us, we will leave to the side.""","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",48,118.0,0.05671428571428572,0.8862857142857142,0.057,0.026042857142857145,0.058,0.856,0.087,0.9866,1.250057142857143,-3.255942857142852,154.0,-0.021142486085343193
Controversial Jerusalem march poses first test for new Israeli government,2021-06-15,"Thousands of Israelis marched in a controversial flag-waving procession through east Jerusalem on Tuesday, risking a new round of tensions with Palestinians and posing the first test for Israel's new government.  The right-wing Jewish march was originally planned for last month as part of ""Jerusalem Day"" festivities, but was canceled minutes after starting when Hamas fired rockets toward Jerusalem on May 10, and the start of an 11-day cross-border conflict between Israel and Gaza's ruling Hamas militant group.  Crowds waving blue and white Israeli flags set off from Damascus Gate, the main entry to the Muslim Quarter of Jerusalem's Old City, dancing and chanting ""This is our home"" and ""Jerusalem is ours.""   Israeli police in riot gear blocked surrounding streets, forcibly removing Palestinian protesters from the route. Thirty-three Palestinian protesters were injured, including by stun grenade, rubber bullets and live fire, with six evacuated to hospital, following clashes with Israeli security forces, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society said.  The flag march is an annual parade where mostly nationalist Jewish groups celebrate Israel gaining control of the Western Wall during the 1967 Six-Day War and captured East Jerusalem, placing the entire city under Israeli control. In previous years, the march has been a flashpoint with Palestinian residents of the Old City.  It comes just days after Israel's new coalition government was approved in a confidence vote in Israeli Parliament, also known as the Knesset, squeaking through by just one vote. Naftali Bennett was sworn in as prime minister on Sunday, replacing Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's longest-serving leader.  The march underlines the stark divisions within the unlikely alliance of right-wing, left-wing, and Arab parties, which have little else in common aside from a shared goal of keeping Netanyahu out of power.  Bennet's name was plastered on some posters at Tuesday's march, along with the word: ""the liar.""  Israel's new foreign minister, Yair Lapid, who will take over from Bennett as prime minister in two years per the coalition agreement, denounced use of the chants of ""death to Arabs"" during the flag march. ""The fact that there are extremist elements for whom the Israeli flag represents hatred and racism is abominable and unforgivable,"" the leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party said on Twitter.  ""It is inconceivable how one can hold the Israeli flag in one hand and shout 'Death to the Arabs' at the same time. This is neither Judaism nor Israeliness, and that is certainly not what our flag symbolizes. These people are a disgrace to the people of Israel,"" he wrote in a tweet.  At one point, the crowd hoisted far-right Knesset member Itamar Ben-Gvir, a former activist with the now-outlawed movement that advocated for Israel to expel Arabs, onto their shoulders.  Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh condemned the march as a ""provocation,"" and Palestinian officials called for a ""Day of Rage"" in protest of the ""Israeli occupation.""

The real earthquake in Israeli politics,2021-06-15,"The new Israeli government sworn into power on Sunday is a motley coalition of political parties with no common ideology beyond ousting Benjamin Netanyahu and ending his 12-year rule. Skeptics rightly wonder how a government could survive that includes both an avid supporter of West Bank settlers like the new Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and Mansour Abbas, a man Bennett once labeled a ""supporter of terrorism"" and now calls ""a decent man.""   But 47-year-old Abbas, a dentist and leader of the United Arab List (Ra'am), a small Islamist party, was the kingmaker whose support allowed the new government to form and gain a majority in the Knesset. An even bigger irony of these strange bedfellows is that Ra'am -- the first Arab party included in a governing coalition -- might very well make Bennett's government a transformational one. If Abbas' gamble pans out -- among other guarantees, the $16 billion he secured for investment in the Arab sector during the coalition agreements will certainly help -- he could be the first of many Arab power brokers in a drastically more democratic Jewish state.   Living in Israel for 20 years as a graduate student and academic between 1995 and 2015, I experienced several election cycles and each time I was exhilarated by the dynamism of Israel's democracy -- for Jewish Israelis. Among Arab friends, all graduates of Israeli universities, I sensed a festering frustration, as if nothing would ever change, no matter who they voted for or what their party's platform said. Higher levels of unemployment than Jewish Israelis, a soaring crime rate in Israeli Arab towns, a housing crunch and discriminatory government spending in vital areas like education seemed as unchangeable as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the West Bank and Gaza. Many of my friends stopped voting, and others left the country altogether.  Battling inequality is difficult in all democracies; in Israel it can seem impossible because Jewish parties have refused to invite Arab parties to join their coalition governments. In Israel's coalition system, small Ultra-Orthodox parties, by contrast, have repeatedly joined coalitions in order to secure government spending on education, housing, and welfare. The voter turnout among Ultra-Orthodox, unsurprisingly, is the highest in the country.   I got my first glimpse into how this unwritten code of governance perpetuates inequality when I wrote a book with Ami Ayalon, the former head of the Shin Bet, Israel's internal security service. Ayalon, a retired admiral whose background is in the special forces and the Navy, was brought in to lead Shin Bet following the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995. Ayalon's brief was to fight a wave of Islamic terror plaguing Israeli cities, and to do so he had to make sure Arab citizens of Israel didn't collaborate with terrorist organizations in the West Bank and Gaza. This meant infiltrating Arab parties and social organizations. It also required him to get to know Arab society and culture in order to understand their complex identities.  He recalls how during his meetings with Arab leaders, he was quick to realize how Israeli policies, not ideology, were pushing Arabs into the arms of Israel's enemies. Before his murder, Rabin's coalition didn't include Arab parties, but he depended on votes by Arab members of the Knesset. Because of this, he treated Arabs as full citizens and dramatically increased spending in the Arab sector.  Once Netanyahu came to power in 1996, he turned off the spigot, and Arabs once again felt a pervasive, systemic discrimination robbing them of the hope of ever being accepted as equals. Their alienation imperiled not only Israeli democracy but also its security. Something had to change.  During cabinet meetings in 1996 and 1997, Ayalon warned then-Prime Minister Netanyahu of the danger of radicalization and pointed out that the government had yet even to discuss the sense of inequality Arabs felt. The prime minister nodded but did nothing, says Ayalon.   In 1996, in the months leading up to the 50th anniversary of a massacre that took place in the Arab village of Kafr Qasim, Ayalon proposed to Netanyahu that he begin the process of creating faith in Israeli democracy by attending the commemoration of the event in the village and apologizing for the Israeli police shooting that killed 48 villagers, including 23 children, for violating a military curfew. Netanyahu said he couldn't apologize for the massacre, and, says Ayalon, moved on to the next item on the daily agenda. Polling data reflects Israeli Arabs' increasing disillusionment with the democracy that should have been helping them. Between 1996 and 2006, Arab participation in national elections dropped from 79% to 56%. They remained locked out of power and influence through the Netanyahu years; their belief in Israeli democracy has continued to erode. In the last election this year, only 45% of Arabs voted.  I no longer live in Israel, so I didn't experience firsthand how pent-up frustration translated into an explosion of rioting and violence in mixed Arab-Jewish cities during the latest war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Successive Israeli governments had chosen a narrow, ethnic, definition of democracy -- that only Jewish votes really count -- over an inclusive democracy which would have brought Arab parties into the government, and the predictions Ayalon had made during his Shin Bet days were coming true.  The reason for locking Arabs out of power was also obvious: At about 21% of the population, Arabs who voted at the same rate as the Ultra-Orthodox -- about 13% of the population -- would be one of the most powerful voting blocs in the country and able to decide which Zionist party has power.   This is why Abbas is such a revolutionary. If the coalition survives the relentless attacks by Netanyahu -- he has vowed to topple the ""fraud government"" -- it will pour billions of dollars into the Arab sector. If past investments in the Ultra-Orthodox community are any guide, such a massive infusion of funds could result in rising employment rates, better education, housing and health care.  By the next election cycle, this means Arabs are likely to respond in precisely the same way the Ultra-Orthodox always have -- by voting. The greater the voter turnout, the more members Knesset Arab parties will have; and the greater the representation in the Knesset, the more indispensable they will be for future coalition governments. What Abbas has started may turn Israeli Arabs into the permanent kingmakers of Israeli democracy.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",39,120.0,0.08585714285714285,0.8661428571428571,0.047857142857142855,-0.23546666666666663,0.094,0.769,0.136,0.9929,-9.1832,14.527257142857149,163.0,0.08912427695004385
"Netanyahu's reign is over for now. He leaves behind a wealthier, more divided Israel and a stalled peace process",2021-06-13,"He's been dubbed King Bibi, the magician, the great survivor, and has held records as both the youngest and longest-serving prime minister of Israel.  But on Sunday, June 13, Benjamin Netanyahu was forced out as prime minister after a record 12-year consecutive term, his second in office.  To his supporters, he's the tireless protector of modern-day Israel who helped turn the small nation into an economic powerhouse with outsized influence on the world stage. To his critics, he's a divider who helped destroy the country's democratic institutions while enabling the rise of extremists.   Without question, Netanyahu has left an indelible mark on Israel, changing and molding its path. And though he may be leaving the highest office for now, his influence is far from over.  ""In some ways Israel is stronger after Netanyahu. Certainly Israel is economically much stronger and militarily ... In other ways he leaves Israel much weaker in particular in the internal divisions."" said Natan Sachs, Director of the Brookings Institution's Center for Middle East Policy. ""After 12 years, he deserves credit and fault.""  Deepening divisions  Despite his years of dominance, Netanyahu rarely garnered a huge amount of Israeli popular support.  He barely beat Shimon Peres in 1996 to become prime minister in one of the few direct elections for the position; in subsequent elections as the leader of Likud, his party never received more than 30% of the vote.   ""Bibi's genius is not so much how many votes he's brought Likud, it's how he's built his coalitions,"" said Anshel Pfeffer, a correspondent for The Economist and Haaretz who has written an extensive biography on Netanyahu titled ""Bibi: The Turbulent Life and Times of Benjamin Netanyahu.""  By fully embracing ultra-Orthodox parties and bringing them into the folds of Likud and other right-wing parties, Netanyahu ""created the situation where he's almost impossible to replace,"" Pfeffer said.  ""He created what he calls the natural allies of Likud, and these parties won't support anyone else partly because they know their voters ... vote for them to a large extent because they know they'll go with Bibi anyway,"" Pfeffer said.  Critics also say Netanyahu's courting and deals with far-right and religious political parties helped embolden them and bring them from the fringes into the mainstream in a way that incites divisions between left and right, religious and secular Jews, and Jews and Arabs.   Netanyahu also advocated for a controversial nation-state law in 2018, which downgraded the Arabic language, failed to mention minority rights, and declared that the Jewish people ""have an exclusive right to national self-determination"" in Israel. While much of the law was symbolic, it was criticized as the ""nail in the coffin"" of Israeli democracy.  But since 2019 Netanyahu has failed to bring about a functioning government -- election after election resulted in the same political deadlock. An investigation and eventual trial into allegations of corruption led to increasing attacks on Israel's judicial system.  ""For the last two years he'd subsumed the fate of the country to his personal fate has also exacerbated the divisions dramatically,"" Sachs said. ""He's attacked the judiciary simply because of his personal fate. And has deeply damaged trust in these institutions.""  Even successfully managing a massive Covid-19 vaccination campaign, which essentially brought the country back to normalcy well ahead of the rest of the world, was not enough for Netanyahu and his allies to fully gain control after the 2021 election.   A stalled peace process and claims of apartheid Any sort of progress on a Palestinian peace process fizzled in the past few years, as Netanyahu instead focused on normalization agreements with other Arab nations, while angering Palestinians by allowing a boom of Israeli settlements to be built in the West Bank.   Netanyahu's position on a future Palestinian state has shifted several times throughout his career. He came into his first term as a strong opponent of the Oslo Accords, which paved the way for a two-state solution. But then Netanyahu said he'd try to implement the accords as prime minister because they were law, angering some of his right-wing base with negotiations and agreements he made with the Palestinians, such as the Wye River Memorandum.   In 2009 he endorsed a two-state solution, so long as certain conditions were met. But before the 2015 Israeli elections he seemed to completely negate the idea, before softening once again. Little if any progress was made during the years of the Obama administration, which had said it would be a priority, though former US diplomat Martin Indyk, who served as Mideast peace envoy, said there was also intransigence from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.  When former US President Donald Trump came into office, the process nearly completely froze. Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and the Palestinian leadership cut ties with the White House in response. Trump also put forward his own peace plan -- spearheaded by his son-in-law Jared Kushner and supported by Netanyahu -- which discarded any conventional notion of two states for two peoples. It was immediately rejected by Palestinian leaders, who described Trump's so-called ""deal of the century"" as the ""slap of the century."" ""(Netanyahu) spent a lot of his time basically creating a situation where there is no solution,"" Sachs said. ""(He) created a situation where Israel and the West Bank are ever more entangled with one another, and the fundamental question of what borders Israel wants and what citizenry it wants, these are fundamental questions he leaves much more acute then when he came in."" His support of policies that promote Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Jewish sovereignty over a united Jerusalem have led to claims of apartheid from organizations like Human Rights Watch. ""The Israeli government has demonstrated an intent to maintain the domination of Jewish Israelis over Palestinians across Israel and the occupied Palestinians territory,"" Human Rights Watch said in a report in April. ""That intent has been coupled with systematic oppression of Palestinians and inhumane acts committed against them. When these three elements occur together, they amount to the crime of apartheid."" Netanyahu and other Israeli officials have vehemently denied the apartheid claim, with the Israeli Foreign Ministry calling Human Rights Watch's report ""fiction"" with a ""a long-standing anti-Israeli agenda."" Three bloody conflicts with Hamas-led militants in Gaza since 2009 and an increasingly divided Palestinian political situation has only further cemented the status quo, Sachs said, although Netanyahu has otherwise kept Israel out of major military conflict.  ""For 12 years he's been prime minister of the major power in this conflict and he's done exactly nothing to reshape it,"" Sachs said. ""On the contrary, he's done a lot to maintain the current state of affairs ... which is only getting worse."" Instead Netanyahu has focused on historic normalization agreements with Arab countries like UAE, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan, deals that were quietly in the works for years but greatly facilitated by Trump.  Pfeffer said such peace deals show how Netanyahu shifted the paradigm in the region away from the idea that peace with the Palestinians must come before Israel could enjoy relations with other Arab nations. ""Israel hasn't given anything else and despite it being under one of the most right-wing governments and having made no progress with Palestinians in so many years ... Sudan, UAE, Bahrain, Morocco all signed agreements,"" Pfeffer said.  For Netanyahu's supporters, those deals showed bold action and new thinking, especially as a way to confront the threat of a nuclear Iran -- a shared concern among many of these Arab countries and Israel. ""The deals with the UAE, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan exemplify the Netanyahu Doctrine of peace through strength and peace in exchange for peace -- as opposed to the tried and failed paradigm of unilateral Israeli territorial concessions for empty promises of peace,"" Netanyahu's strategic advisor Aaron Klein wrote in an Op-Ed for Newsweek this month.  Outsized international influence   Israel may have a population of less than 10 million, but its presence on the world stage has always loomed larger -- ballooning even further under Netanyahu. In his memoir, former President Barack Obama described Netanyahu as ""smart, canny, tough and a gifted communicator,"" who deployed his fluent English and deep knowledge of American politics to help sway policy in the US.   Netanyahu branded himself as the leader of the fight against anti-Semitism around the world and against a nuclear Iran as well as Tehran's regional proxies, like Hezbollah.    His campaign against the Iran nuclear deal further strained an already wobbly relationship with Obama. It came to a tipping point in 2015, when Netanyahu was invited to speak before a then-Republican-controlled Congress about the deal, infuriating the White House. Then came Trump, with a bromance that gave Netanyahu political gift after political gift, including recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and endorsing Israeli sovereignty in the Golan Heights.   Netanyahu never publicly criticized Trump and touted their close relationship in giant billboards during his election campaigns, even unveiling a settlement named after Trump in the Golan Heights.   But his handling of the Palestinian issue, and his closeness to Trump and other populist leaders around the world, helped erode longstanding bipartisan support for Israel in the US, Sachs and Pfeffer said.  ""Israel is more reviled on the American left than it has ever been,"" Sachs said.  Beyond the United States, Netanyahu has tried to boost Israel's diplomatic and economic ties in Latin America and Asia, while maintaining important strategic relationships with world powers like India and Russia.  ""(Netanyahu) was very good in capitalizing on the geopolitical developments,"" Pfeffer said, noting that ""he did not invent populism."" He's not done yet  Though he may no longer be prime minister, Netanyahu's political life is far from over. Friend or foe, many marvel at the 71-year-old's seemingly boundless energy.  He's expected to continue in parliament as a vocal opposition leader attempting to chip away at what will be a fragile government comprised of many disparate political parties who don't seem to agree on much other than their opposition to Netanyahu.  If the new government fails, new elections would be called, giving Netanyahu a way back into the prime minister's office. But Pfeffer noted Netanyahu may have a big motivation to leave his parliament: money. Netanyahu still faces an ongoing corruption trial, one that is expected to last several costly years.

The private Naftali Bennett is a different man,2021-06-14,"In 2015, I was a news producer for Al Jazeera America (AJAM). I was familiar with well-rehearsed politicians, whose attention spans were shorter than their one-liners -- and I thought then-Israeli Minister of Education Naftali Bennett would be no different. As an Israeli working for a Qatari news outlet, I also knew how quickly right-wing Israelis were ready to pigeonhole me.  But my surprising conversation with Bennett at that time revealed there was more common ground than resentment between Israel's political left and right. Now that Bennett has become Israel's new prime minister, that conversation has taken on new meaning -- and particularly in the wake of 12 consecutive years of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin ""Bibi"" Netanyahu's reign. Though Bennett, an Orthodox entrepreneur and leader of the small Yamina party, has positioned himself to the right of Netanyahu and as the would-be leader of religious Zionism, in recent weeks, he has revealed an even greater commitment -- to bring solace to Israeli people on all sides of the political spectrum.  In November 2015, I invited Bennett to appear on AJAM in the middle of a round of fighting between Israelis and Palestinians. A rare breed among Israeli politicians, he, like Netanyahu, spoke American English and possessed a keen understanding of the media. He was a zealous soldier defending Israel on the media battlefield and a shrewd politician building his brand on the international stage. Hence, when offered an opportunity to appear on camera, he didn't hesitate.  When Bennett and his entourage arrived at the marbled lobby of AJAM on 34th Street, I welcomed and escorted them to the green room, answered a few technical questions and chatted in Hebrew about their New York trip. Once Bennett was done with makeup, he looked up from his phone and asked, ""So, what's your story anyway?"" I'd been working as a segment producer for a decade by then, and no guest of any nationality has ever asked me that question. It was my job to tease out their talking points while working to break the ice. The icebreaker with most guests was my Israeli accent. ""What's an Israeli journalist doing working for Al Jazeera?"" was what every guest wanted to know.  ""Do they know you are Israeli?"" I was frequently asked, followed by, ""How can you work for a network that's funded by those who want to wipe your country off the map?"" and for the brave ones, ""Are you comfortable being part of the propaganda machine?""  While I wasn't getting any editorial instructions or directions from our Qatari headquarters, I was challenged by American pundits and politicians snubbing our interview requests. Every single sitting Israeli politician of any political party and affiliations screened my calls.  Everyone except Bennett. ""Well, um, I came to New York after I graduated from Tel Aviv Uni--"" I started with the banal detail, but he was amused, interjecting: ""Oh, a Tel Aviv University leftist, I get it..."" His trademark half smile appeared. I chuckled with confusion, but instantly felt at ease.   No point in hiding our differences, he signaled. I knew his positions well. Now, my sympathies were clear, too. And, in that moment, he went from being Minister Bennett to just Naftali. We talked about life away from home, missing family and choosing a career in journalism. I opened up about my personal life, how I met my partner-- ""an Israeli?"" he asked. ""Yes,"" I replied. ""In fact, he's a right-wing capitalist, who grew up Orthodox, served as a combat officer in the IDF and now works on Wall Street,"" I said, hinting at the similarities to his own resume.  I mentioned that now, six months after our first son was born, we considered moving back to Israel for the first time, despite our love for New York. We talked about the media and working for AJAM, and then he was called on set.  Once the lights were on Bennett, opposite anchor Antonio Mora, his congenial tone dissolved -- and the hawkish, settler-sympathizer came on.  Off-set, I rushed out to thank him and say goodbye to his crew. Bennett was walking fast, preparing for the next media appearance, but he was kind and admitted that the AJAM interview was tough, but fair.   Just before he disappeared behind the revolving glass door, his warmth and friendly voice returned: ""Left, right, doesn't matter,"" he exclaimed. ""Come back home.""   Finally, he and my mother agreed on something, I thought. And three years later I did come back home. On June 6, 2021, Bennett gave a dramatic and somber direct statement to Netanyahu: Don't leave ""scorched earth"" as you step down. After two years of deadlock, Israelis on the left, right and center of the political map were so fed up with Netanyahu's deceit and scandals that they were able to see in Bennett what I heard in that conversation -- a compassionate man who cares about his country and its people.   Naftali seems genuine. Let's just hope Prime Minister Bennett doesn't disappoint.

NATO President Joe Biden is in Brussels today to attend the 31st NATO Summit, his first as President. A lot is riding on the gathering -- including the US' commitment to NATO itself. Former President Donald Trump frequently rallied against the trade alliance, but Biden has reiterated his support of NATO and its goals of transatlantic security and collective defense. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the countries at today's summit will agree to the group's 2030 agenda, which is focused on strengthening collective defenses, strengthening resilience, sharpening their technological edges and working with likeminded partners. They'll also talk about ways to approach Russia -- a well-timed conversation since Biden is due to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday.  2. G7   ""America is back at the table."" That's what Biden said yesterday, on the last day of the G7 summit in the UK. During the summit, Biden aimed to show G7 allies that the US is recommitted to global concerns like climate change, which was a main talking point at the meeting. In addition to new commitments to climate change action, like halving emissions by 2030 from 2010 levels, leaders from the representative countries agreed to an additional 1 billion Covid-19 vaccines to poor or middle-income countries. They also issued a call for a new study into the origins of Covid-19 after an initial report was deemed lacking because Beijing had refused to cooperate. 3. Israel Naftali Bennett was sworn in as Israel's new prime minister yesterday, ending former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's 12 years in office. After four elections in two years, Bennett's incoming government breaks a long political deadlock and ushers in the most diverse coalition Israel has ever seen, including the first Arab party to serve in the government. Netanyahu, who commands a much larger political faction, is not taking the defeat lying down. In a debate ahead of the swearing-in, Netanyahu denounced the coalition that ousted him from office, calling it a ""weak"" and ""dangerous"" government and saying it wouldn't be able to stand up to global rivals like Iran. ""We'll be back soon,"" Netanyahu said, as a warning to both his internal rivals and outside enemies.  4. Coronavirus A dangerous Covid-19 variant is on the rise in the US, and could do serious damage in areas with low vaccination rates, a former FDA official says. The Delta variant currently accounts for about 10% of US Covid-19 infections, but but that proportion is doubling every two weeks and may become the dominant strain in the US. That may not mean a sharp uptick in infections across the country, which has administered more than 309 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine, but specific regions are at risk. Nationally, 64.4% of adults have received at least one dose of the vaccine, but some states, like Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Wyoming, are seeing significantly lower rates.  5. DOJ Leaders from CNN, The New York Times and The Washington Post will meet with US Attorney General Merrick Garland today to discuss the Trump administration's controversial leak investigation that involved seeking reporter records from all three media outlets. This comes after the revelation that Department of Justice officials took aggressive steps to obtain 2017 phone and email records of reporters at the three outlets. Democrats are demanding sworn testimony from Donald Trump's former attorneys general involved in the scandal. These revelations pile on to other recent subpoena news. Last week, it was revealed prosecutors in Trump's Justice Department subpoenaed Apple for data from the accounts of House Intelligence Committee Democrats. Former Trump White House counsel Don McGahn and his wife also reportedly received disclosures from Apple last month that their account records were sought by the Justice Department in February 2018.

Israel will remain Netanyahu's even though he is no longer prime minister,2021-05-31,"On May 31, Naftali Bennett, the right-wing politician who became Israel's new prime minister on Sunday, finally broke cover and lambasted his old boss and mentor Benjamin Netanyahu for trying to lead the state of Israel to his own ""personal Masada"" -- a reference to the Jewish zealots who committed mass suicide rather than become Roman slaves in the first century A.D. Bennett announced that he would be forming a national-unity government with Yair Lapid, the leader of the centrist Yesh Atid opposition party. The parties opposed to Netanyahu not only have a majority in Israel's parliament, the Knesset, but they are now actually working together. This seems to have spelled the end of Netanyahu's long period in power -- 12 years since he returned to office in 2009, 15 years in total. But it would be premature to pronounce the end of Israel's Netanyahu Era. For a start, Netanyahu may have lost any prospect of mustering a majority of his own, but he seems certain to continue exerting every ounce of pressure on wavering members of the opposition, including allowing proxies like his son Yair and his social media manager Topaz Luk to amplify the toxic social-media campaigns against Bennett and members of his Yamina party that have fueled angry protests outside their homes accusing them of being ""Leftist Traitors.""  Even if they succeed in keeping their coalition together, Netanyahu is going nowhere. He remains leader of Likud, Israel's largest party, and he's unlikely to give up that position. Although he's facing criminal charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust -- all of which he has denied -- his trial is expected to take years. And Israeli law would allow him to serve again as prime minister while the case is continuing. Nor is there any Likudnik on the horizon with anything coming close to his popularity, who can threaten to unseat him.   As the leader of the opposition, with a considerable hardcore of fanatical supporters still intact, Netanyahu is sure to be daily plotting another comeback, awaiting any slip-up of his successor and exploiting discord in the unwieldy new coalition of wildly diverse and disparate parties. Yet another election -- the fifth in two years -- could be just around the corner and Netanyahu remains a constant campaigner, even at 71. Those who expect Netanyahu's stature and ability to dominate Israel's agenda to be severely diminished if he's pushed out of office could end up sorely disappointed. For many Israelis, Netanyahu will remain the king-in-exile, for years to come. And even if he never makes it back into the prime minister's office, his stamp on Israel will last for decades. For a start, the incoming government is comprised to a large degree by politicians he molded. Bennett began his public career as Netanyahu's chief of staff and learned how to be a politician from him. Likewise, Netanyahu shaped many of the new government's senior members -- Avigdor Lieberman, Ayelet Shaked, Gideon Sa'ar, Zeev Elkin and others. They may have become his implacable rivals, but they were all his protégés unlikely ever to fully emerge from his shadow. It's not just Israel's political class that has been imprinted by Netanyahu. In pursuit and perpetuation of his power, he has exploited every divide, between Jews and Arabs, religious and secular, Ashkenazi and Mizrahi, stoking historic resentments and playing communities off each other. It will take years, probably decades, for Israeli society to heal.  Meanwhile he has done everything in his power to reverse any progress that was achieved by his predecessors on trying to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Netanyahu refused to countenance any concessions to the Palestinians, insisting that time is working on Israel's side. His approach worked under the supportive Donald Trump administration, when four Arab countries were prepared to ignore the Palestinian issue and make peace with Israel, but more recently, tensions have once again exploded into violence in the latest bloody clash with Hamas in Gaza and riots on the streets of Israel.  The new government is united only by the desire to replace Netanyahu. It's unlikely to be capable of agreeing of any policy going forward on resolving the conflict. Neither is the new government expected to make any radical changes to Israel's regional policy. It will continue to confront Iran's nuclear program and proxies, though it may be less vocal than Netanyahu was against the Iran nuclear deal if the Biden administration rejoins it.  Netanyahu's Israel is at war with itself and far from realizing any peace with its Palestinian neighbors. It will remain Netanyahu's Israel long after he is no longer its prime minister.

"Israel's new prime minister is sworn in, ending Netanyahu's 12-year grip on power",2021-06-13,"Naftali Bennett was sworn in as Israel's new prime minister on Sunday, after winning a confidence vote with the narrowest of margins, just 60 votes to 59. His victory ends a 12-year grip on power by former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the country's longest-serving leader.  After four elections in two years, Bennett's incoming government breaks a long political deadlock and ushers in the most diverse coalition Israel has ever seen, including the first Arab party to serve in the government.  In his speech before the Knesset confidence vote, Bennett celebrated the diversity and warned of polarization within the country. ""Twice in history, we have lost our national home precisely because the leaders of the generation were not able to sit with one and another and compromise. Each was right, yet with all their being right, they burnt the house down on top of us,"" Bennett said. ""I am proud of the ability to sit together with people with very different views from my own."" Bennett became the premier as the leader of Yamina, a right-wing party with only seven seats in Israel's parliament, the Knesset, making him the only prime minister in the country's history with such a small faction. By contrast, Netanyahu's Likud party won 30 seats in March's election. Once again, however, Netanyahu could not cobble together a governing coalition with a majority of the 120 members of Knesset. US President Joe Biden on Sunday congratulated Bennett in his first statement about the political situation in Israel, saying he looked forward to working with the new prime minister. Biden also spoke with Bennett on the phone, according to a readout of the call from the White House. ""The leaders agreed that they and their teams would consult closely on all matters related to regional security, including Iran,"" the White House said. ""The President also conveyed that his administration intends to work closely with the Israeli government on efforts to advance peace, security, and prosperity for Israelis and Palestinians."" A statement from Bennett's office said the two leaders ""emphasized the importance of the alliance between Israel and the United States, as well as their commitment to strengthening ties between the two countries, and maintaining the security of the State of Israel. During the call, Bennett also expressed appreciation for Biden's ""support for Israel during the recent operation in Gaza,"" according to the readout. 'We'll be back soon' During the debate ahead of the swearing-in, Netanyahu had assailed the coalition that ousted him from the Prime Minister's Office after a record 12 consecutive years, calling it a ""weak"" and ""dangerous"" government.  Long considered the ""magician"" of Israeli politics, Netanyahu had survived years of challenges to his power, outlasting and outmaneuvering his opponents. But on this night, he had too many opponents who wanted to see him gone. After touting his accomplishments throughout his years in office, Netanyahu assailed his rivals. ""You call yourself the guardians of democracy, but you are so afraid of democracy that you are ready to pass fascist laws against my candidacy -- the language of North Korea and Iran -- in order to maintain your regime,"" he said, referring to speculation that the new government would impose term limits or make it illegal for someone who has been indicted to be Prime Minister.  Warning that the new government would not stand up to Iran, Netanyahu warned his internal rivals and outside enemies, ""We'll be back soon."" Common ground Bennett's path to victory seemed all but lost during 11 days of fighting between Israel and Palestinian militants last month, when Netanyahu appeared to scuttle any chances of the opposition parties forming a government to replace him. But Yair Lapid, head of the centrist Yesh Atid party which holds 17 seats, forged the agreements between the different parties that led to the end of Netanyahu's grip on power. The arrangement places Bennett at the head of a coalition that includes right-wing, left-wing, and Arab parties, united largely by their desire to dethrone Netanyahu. These disparate interests will challenge the coalition to find common ground on key issues, such as what policy to pursue with the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank or how to manage the relationship with Gaza. The international community, including the United States, are pushing for the renewal of a peace process between the Israelis and Palestinians, but this government is ill-equipped to handle such negotiations, since two of the parties are vocally opposed to the establishment of a Palestinian state.   Instead, Bennett will focus on domestic issues during his two years as prime minister, before he hands the reins to Lapid according to their coalition agreement. These will include the relationship between religion and state, the cost of living, and quality of life issues. Israel also has not passed a budget since March 2018; the newly anointed government has three months to enact one or the Knesset will dissolve and the country will once again head to elections by law.  Yet the neophyte administration will have no choice but to deal with some of the thornier issues. In East Jerusalem, the eviction of several Palestinian families in the neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah is still awaiting a High Court decision. The final ruling was delayed in an attempt to avert tension and violence in Jerusalem last month, but it nevertheless sparked a chain of escalation that led to more than a week of conflict between Israel and Gaza, leaving hundreds dead, most of them Palestinians. Throughout his political career, Israel's new prime minister has served as the defense minister, economy minister, education minister and more. But it was always under Netanyahu, and Bennett began his political career as Netanyahu's chief of staff. In replacing his former boss, Bennett has already etched his name into the country's political history, especially after years of unprecedented political stalemate. Bennett's success and political survival ultimately depend on his ability to forge compromise between the different parties in the coalition, even if only on a narrow domestic agenda. If not, he risks ending his time as prime minister shortly after it begins.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",37,125.0,0.04881818181818182,0.8225454545454546,0.12863636363636363,0.3355125,0.058,0.838,0.104,0.9867,12.4139625,21.249596439393944,231.0,0.09198959497573136
Netanyahu battles to stay in power in potential last weekend as Israel's Prime Minister,2021-06-12,"On what may turn out to be his final weekend as Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu is engaged in one final fight to remain in power and extend his 12 consecutive years at Israel's helm. Over the past week, Netanyahu has accused the man set to replace him, Naftali Bennett, of carrying out ""the greatest election fraud in the history of the country"" and establishing a ""dangerous"" government, in language that echoed former President Donald Trump's baseless claims following the 2020 US election. Netanyahu's Likud party softened the false claims of election fraud on Thursday, but only slightly. Instead of saying there were miscounted votes or systemic fraud, the party posted on Twitter that ""Bennett hijacked votes from the right and shifted them to the left in direct contradiction to his [campaign] pledges. If this isn't fraud we don't know what is.""  In a Twitter thread that was shared by Netanyahu, the Likud said there would be a peaceful transition of power to a new government. ""There always has been a peaceful transfer of power in Israel and there will always be,"" the Likud wrote. The party blamed unnamed others for what it claims are the ways Netanyahu's words were ""distorted.""  But that doesn't mean Netanyahu is resigned to his defeat or leaving the Prime Minister's official residence on Balfour Street in Jerusalem quietly. Netanyahu has repeatedly portrayed himself as the only one who can keep Israel safe from enemies in Iran, Gaza and Lebanon. In Israel's 120-seat Parliament, known as the Knesset, Bennett has a razor-thin majority of 61 seats. Netanyahu and his allies have been working to pressure politicians from the right-wing Yamina and New Hope parties to vote against Bennett's new government in a crucial confidence vote scheduled for Sunday afternoon. In his final speech before the vote, Bennett promised unity as he faced a hail of abuse from allies of Benjamin Netanyahu. As Bennett walked to the podium to address the Knesset plenum, members of Netanyahu's Likud party, as well as the ultra Orthodox parties and the far right Religious Zionism party began yelling at Bennett, accusing him of lying and stealing votes from the right. Bennett said he would work to bring the country together, even with those who disagreed with him. ""Twice in our history, we lost our Jewish home exactly because leaders of the previous generation refused to sit one with another,"" Bennett said. ""I am proud to sit with people with different opinions.  At the decisive moment, we took responsibility."" Bennett was repeatedly interrupted and had to pause as the Speaker of the Knesset issued warnings to politicians who kept interrupting. Multiple lawmakers from Likud and from Religious Zionism were expelled from the debate ahead of the vote. Bennett thanked Netanyahu for his years of service, and expressed gratitude for the work he did on behalf of Israel's security, economy and more.  In what could be his final speech as Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu attacked the incoming government and promised his internal rivals and external enemies that he would soon be back.   ""In Iran, they are celebrating today because they understand that from today, there is a weak and feeble government that will follow the instructions of the international community,"" Netanyahu said. The 71-year-old leader is not out yet, but he seemed to accept the anticipated victory of the so-called ""change bloc"" set to oust him from power. If Bennett loses the vote, however, his effort to oust the man for whom he once worked will have failed, likely sending Israel to its fifth election in two-and-a-half years. The failure would leave Netanyahu as interim Prime Minister, a title he has held throughout most of Israel's recent political turmoil. As part of his ongoing tirade pressure campaign against Bennett, Netanyahu tweeted earlier this week, ""Whoever is right does not vote for a left-wing government, and whoever is for a left-wing government is not right.""   Bennett buttressed support for his coalition when a member of his own Yamina party, considered one of those most likely to defect and scuttle the nascent government, pledged his support on Tuesday. On Sunday, Bennett urged Israel's longtime leader to support an orderly transition of power and not to leave ""scorched earth"" behind him. ""This is not a catastrophe, this is not a disaster. It is a change of government. An ordinary and usual event in any democratic country,"" Bennett said at a press conference Sunday night at the Knesset. ""The system in the state of Israel is not monarchical. No one has a monopoly on power."" Netanyahu has not yet publicly conceded defeat to his former chief of staff, fully aware of the opportunities he still has to find rifts and fissures to exploit in Bennett's government. The coalition is set to be the most diverse in Israel's history, including right-wing, left-wing and Arab parties.  But the alliance of eight different parties, each with its own, disparate interests, may have little common ground to hold it together other than its desire to remove Netanyahu from office. The unity of Bennett's government is facing its first major test on Sunday afternoon, as the Knesset debates the coalition's priorities and policies before the swearing in vote. The debate is expected to last a few hours, during which Netanyahu and his allies will try to find pressure points to pull one party away from another. Only then will the speaker of the Knesset, a member of Netanyahu's Likud party, call the confidence vote. It will be a critical moment, one that not only decides the leader of the country, but also reveals whether Netanyahu, long considered the ""magician"" of Israeli politics, has one more trick to play.","{'neg': 0.167, 'neu': 0.833, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.3818}",41,126.0,0.1091,0.76075,0.13015000000000002,0.052575000000000004,0.117,0.752,0.131,0.9666,2.1555750000000002,11.623264772727278,204.0,0.05697678810160431
"Netanyahu is failing, but not exactly the way Trump did",2021-06-09,"On Sunday afternoon, Benjamin Netanyahu went full Donald Trump. Facing a new coalition, led by his former protégé Naftali Bennett, with the seats needed to replace him as Israel's prime minister, Netanyahu went on the attack. ""We are witnessing the greatest election fraud in the history of the country, in my opinion in the history of any democracy,"" he said in a meeting with his Likud faction. Sounds familiar? So does the next bit. ""We, my friends and I in Likud, we will vehemently oppose the establishment of this dangerous government of fraud and surrender,"" Netanyahu thundered.  But he was also prepared to accept at least temporary defeat. ""And if, God forbid, it is established, we will bring it down very quickly."" Given the similarity in Netanyahu and Trump's rhetoric, it's worth asking: Is Israel about to face its own January 6, with thousands of armed right-wing militia members storming the Knesset, the Israeli Parliament, before the new government is likely sworn-in on Sunday?  Probably not. However, Shin Bet, Israel's internal security agency, felt the need on Saturday night to issue a rare public warning against the toxic discourse and incitement to violence, especially on social media.  As of now, though, there are no signs of any widespread plan to physically obstruct the transfer of power this weekend. But even if Israel is saved the spectacle of a Capitol Hill-like insurrection, the resilience of its democracy has been sorely tested in the latter years of the Netanyahu era, and like in the US, its core institutions have had to fight back and safeguard basic principles. Of course, Netanyahu and his remaining allies will keep up the pressure on potential defectors from the new coalition, as they have been doing for weeks now. But the torrent of verbal abuse -- online and in protests outside politicians' homes -- coupled with discreet inducements to the wavering members of the new government is unlikely to escalate much further. And so far, at least, it seems to be failing.  It looks like Netanyahu, unless he persuades a surprise defector, will leave office next week, peacefully but without the semblance of grace. The sight of a second populist leader being forced to leave office following a hard-fought election (in Israel's case, following four consecutive elections) within the space of six months should be instructive.  What the current wave of populist leaders around the world share in common is their populist rhetoric of ""us"" -- the ""people"" versus ""the establishment"" -- the ""elitist traitors"" and their ""foreign"" supporters. They also share an instinctive capability to identify the phobias and the resentments of their base, and are adept at stoking them -- building angry coalitions of fear, of loss of privilege and disenfranchisement.  Beyond that, however, every populist is different.  Netanyahu, unlike Trump, is both a professional politician and an intellectual. That is how he succeeded in staging political comebacks -- despite earlier setbacks and defeats in his career, defying the pundits' predictions and the polls, and ultimately becoming Israel's longest-serving prime minister.  That's how he succeeded in shifting a diplomatic paradigm -- the assumption that Israel would never enjoy economic prosperity and have strong relations with countries both in the region and around the world, if it did not make the necessary concessions to solve its conflict with the Palestinians, has been proven false. The Israeli economy has grown and, with the assistance of the Trump administration, Netanyahu has made peace with several Arab and Muslim neighbors. For Netanyahu, populism is just a tool to be used for electoral purposes. Behind it, though, there's a sophisticated and deeply thought-out strategy.  But his strategy for perpetuating his hold on power has ultimately failed, as did Trump's populism, because it didn't take into account the resilience of Israel's democracy-guarding institutions -- the legal establishment, the media and the electoral system. He tried to subvert each of these and was only partially successful.  Netanyahu seemingly thought that by appointing a friendly attorney general and a convenient national police commissioner, he would be immune from investigation and prosecution. But in both cases, their professionalism -- and those of their teams -- won out. His alleged corruption came to light. Despite remaining in office until now, Netanyahu has been indicted and is on trial for bribery, fraud and breach of trust charges. (He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.)  He allegedly tried to bully both journalists and their publishers. He encouraged supportive tycoons, like the late Sheldon Adelson, to set up their own newspapers and stations in the hope of driving critical new organizations out of business. Some in the media sold out, but enough kept on going to provide the public with the full picture of events.  And he tried to impugn the electoral system, claiming that it was rife with fraud perpetrated by Arab citizens, but elections continued to be held transparently and with high public trust in their results. It finally yielded a majority that not only prevented Netanyahu from forming a new government of his own, but was capable of working together to replace him. In Israel and in the US, the institutions persevered, outlasted populist leaders and helped bring about their downfall. But the resilience of these institutions cannot be taken for granted -- they require strengthening now that the threat has passed, perhaps only temporarily.

Process to replace Netanyahu drags out as Israeli security chief warns violence could follow,2021-06-07,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his allies are dragging out the political process, seeking to undermine a new government set to remove him from power, as the head of the Israel Security Agency warned of incitement to violence in the charged environment. Using language reminiscent of former US President Donald Trump, Netanyahu falsely accused a newly-formed coalition of eight parties poised to unseat him within days of ""election fraud."" The Speaker of the Knesset, a close ally of Netanyahu, refused to announce a date for the swearing in of the new government. By law, he has up to a week, but the largely technical process has traditionally been carried out as quickly as possible once a new government is announced. The delay is ""in contradiction"" to the country's democratic traditions, said Yohanan Plesner, director of the Israel Democracy Institute. ""All of a sudden, we are all aware of the intricate aspects of this process and the ability of the speaker to stretch and extend this period in order to allow the Prime Minister to try to subvert the process."" But Netanyahu is determined not to go quietly. Unlike Trump, who baselessly spoke of stolen votes and miscounts, Netanyahu claimed that his rival right-wing parties defrauded voters by supporting a coalition with left-wing parties. ""We are witnessing the greatest election fraud in the history of the country, in my opinion in the history of any democracy,"" Netanyahu said Sunday to lawmakers from his right-wing Likud party. The unfounded claim came as Israel's domestic security chief issued a rare public warning that the increasingly extreme discourse could incite violence. On Sunday, a member of Netanyahu's Likud party compared Naftali Bennett, the man set to replace Netanyahu, to a ""suicide bomber."" After 12 years in office, Israel's longest serving prime minister faces being ousted by a diverse coalition of political parties united primarily by their shared desire to remove him.  In a last-ditch effort to hold onto power, Netanyahu has marshaled his supporters to pressure rival politicians to defect ahead of a parliamentary vote of confidence, the final stage in formalizing the new government.  The vote could be held as early as Wednesday, but is widely expected to be held next Monday, the latest possible day allowable by law. Counter protests took place Monday outside the home of Nir Orbach, a member of the Yamina party, who was seen as the politician most likely to vote against the new government. One protest urged Orbach to defect and possibly sink the coalition, while a separate protest encouraged him to support the coalition and oust Netanyahu.  Netanyahu has focused his ire on a broken campaign promise by Bennett, head of the small right-wing Yamina party. Bennett, who pledged not to join forces with centrist leader Yair Lapid, went on to form an improbable coalition with his Yesh Atid party and a series of other smaller parties from across the political spectrum following Israel's fourth election in two years. Under a ""rotation"" agreement, Bennett will serve as prime minister first, followed by Lapid. On Sunday, Bennett urged Israel's longtime leader to support an orderly transition of power and not to leave ""scorched earth"" behind him. ""This is not a catastrophe, this is not a disaster. It is a change of government. An ordinary and usual event in any democratic country,"" Bennett said at a press conference Sunday night at the 120-seat Parliament, known as the Knesset. ""The system in the state of Israel is not monarchical. No one has a monopoly on power."" Netanyahu's time in office has been overshadowed by a long-running corruption trial, in which he has denied wrongdoing. His critics have alternately accused him of exploiting the pandemic and an eruption of conflict with Gaza to maintain his grip on power and derail his criminal trial. The last few months in Israel have seen a series of events characterized by incitement and intolerance, including protests that turned violent and threats against politicians. Bennett said that members of his Yamina party and the New Hope party -- two right-wing parties taking part in the unity coalition -- have been the target of a campaign ""aimed at breaking them,"" including curses and threats, in order to collapse the new government. Last week, a member of the left-wing Meretz party, Tamar Zandberg, left her home because of explicit threats against both her and her toddler. Zandberg has called on Netanyahu to ""immediately stop the hatred machine that is responsible for threats and public figures receiving added security which can reach violence and even murder."" And at least two members of the Yamina party, including Bennett, have been given added security because of threats made against them. While calling for the swearing-in of the new government to take place on Wednesday, Bennett placed the blame at the feet of Netanyahu for the charged discourse. ""From here, I call on Mr. Netanyahu: Calm down. Free up the country and allow it to move on. It is allowed for people to vote for a government, even if you are not in charge of it,"" Bennett said. ""It's not 'us and them.' No one here is an enemy."" On Saturday, the head of Israel's Shin Bet internal security service, Nadav Argaman, warned in an unprecedented public statement that ""an intensifying and severe increase in the violent and inciting discourse,"" especially online, could lead to real-world violence.  ""It is our duty to come out with a clear and definitive call to stop the discourse of incitement and violence. The responsibility for calming the winds and restraining the discourse rests on all of our shoulders,"" Argaman said. But Netanyahu's supporters are showing no signs of trying to de-escalate tensions.   A member of Netanyahu's Likud party and one of the prime minister's key allies, May Golan, on Sunday compared the mission of Bennett and New Hope leader Gideon Saar of being ""suicide bombers"" and ""terrorists."" ""There is a world of difference, but they're like terrorists who no longer believe in anything, who go out on their suicide mission, and even if they know that it's a death sentence, it doesn't matter to them,"" Golan said, speaking on Knesset TV.  Pressed repeatedly by the anchors to retract or soften her rhetoric, Golan refused, insisting that she was not exaggerating. Responding to the Shin Bet's warning of incitement, Miri Regev, Likud transportation minister, said in a statement sent to media: ""We will continue protesting against the theft of right-wing votes in a respectful and democratic way without violence."" On Monday, Israeli police refused to grant permission for a nationalist ""flag march"" through the Muslim quarter of Jerusalem's Old City this Thursday. The provocative annual parade, which usually occurs on Jerusalem Day, was canceled one month ago because of concerns that it would inflame an already tense situation. Betzalel Smotrich, a Knesset member and one of the organizers of the parade, called the decision a ""shameful surrender to terrorism and Hamas threats."" Several other lawmakers said they would march regardless of the police decision.

Biden poised to announce first slate of ambassador nominees as he eyes first trip abroad,2021-06-05,"President Joe Biden has made final decisions on several high-profile ambassador posts around the world and is poised to announce the first slate of nominees in the coming days as he prepares to set off on his first overseas trip since taking office. The White House has started notifying countries of the President's choices, officials said, which is one of the final steps before the ambassador nominations are formally made. Extensive vetting, along with a desire to find a diverse roster of candidates, has caused repeated delays but officials said an announcement of the top diplomats could come next week.  ""We hope to have more soon,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday, adding that the notification process of officials in host countries was already underway. A White House official said Friday that it was the administration's goal to make the announcements before the President leaves next week for his first trip abroad. Yet the timeline has been repeatedly moved back, so the official declined to guarantee the goal would be reached. Top diplomats to China, Japan, Israel, India and several European countries are expected to be among those included in the first wave of ambassador nominees. The list includes several top donors, former senators and their spouses, people familiar with the selection tell CNN.  One of the biggest questions still hanging over the search for US ambassadors is for the Court of St. James, which is the prestigious post in the United Kingdom. It has been the subject of considerable discussion on both sides of the Atlantic, but several officials told CNN they weren't certain whom Biden had settled on or whether a final choice would even be made before Biden is set to visit next week on the first stop of his weeklong tour. Several candidates have turned the post down, which extended the selection process, a person familiar with the matter said.  Nicholas Burns, a career diplomat who has served presidents of both political parties, is expected to be nominated as ambassador to China. Rahm Emanuel, the former Chicago mayor, Illinois congressman and the first White House chief of staff in the Obama administration, is poised to be nominated as ambassador to Japan. Tom Nides, a former deputy secretary of state in the Obama administration and a longtime executive at Morgan Stanley, is expected to be tapped as ambassador to Israel. This post has taken on even greater significance in the wake of the ceasefire reached late last month between Israel and Gaza and the expected fall of longtime Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The nominees are subject to confirmation hearings in the closely divided Senate, which means none of the ambassadors are likely to be in their posts before late summer or early fall. The timing has put the Biden administration behind the pace set by his most recent predecessors and has led to frustration among some State Department officials and top donors, who have been in something of a holding pattern for months. Foreign diplomats in Washington have also privately raised questions about the delays. Vickie Kennedy, the wife of the late Sen. Edward Kennedy, is also a leading contender to serve as ambassador to Germany, people familiar with the process told CNN.  People tracking the process closely, including former ambassadors, donors and State Department officials also say Cindy McCain, wife of the late Sen. John McCain, is expected to be nominated as the US envoy to the United Nations Food Program in Rome. Denise Bauer, an ambassador to Belgium in the Obama administration and leader of Women for Biden, is poised to be tapped as ambassador to France. And Michael Adler, a Miami real estate developer who has a long friendship with Biden, is expected to be nominated for the post in Belgium. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, who served on Biden's vice presidential selection committee, is expected to be selected as ambassador to India. The President is also considering former Colorado Sen. Ken Salazar for ambassador to Mexico. Former Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill and former Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake are also being considered for other posts, people familiar with the matter say, as is Claire Lucas, a top Biden fundraiser and chair of the LGBTQ Victory Institute Board of Directors.   At least two high-level contenders were taken out of consideration in recent weeks, a personal familiar with the matter said, after the vetting of finances and statements on social media emerged as a potential challenge during the confirmation process. Above all, a senior administration official said, one of the biggest reasons for the delay is that the selection has become something of a game of musical chairs. Several donors or friends of Biden expressed interest in one position, but were offered second choices, given the overall list of nominees. ""Diversity among ambassadors is just as important to the President as diversity in his Cabinet,"" a White House official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to talk about the closed-door process. ""And that is a process."" Even since Biden has taken office, the political circumstances in several key countries has changed. Israel is the greatest example, with a deadly conflict last month giving way to a ceasefire and likely a new prime minister. The Biden administration's policy on the Middle East will be scrutinized during confirmation hearings, which are expected to be held later this summer. From Capitol Hill to the Middle East, the selection of Nides has been the subject of considerable discussion for weeks among close watchers of Israel. A longtime top Democratic donor, Nides served as chief operating officer at Morgan Stanley before stepping down in 2010 to work under Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

Few Israelis wanted a leader to the right of Netanyahu. Naftali Bennett is set to oust his old boss anyway.,2021-06-04,"After the 2019 elections, Naftali Bennett's right-wing party failed to cross the electoral threshold and had no seats in Israel's parliament.   Two years later, he's on the verge of becoming the country's next prime minister.  A former chief of staff to then-opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu, Bennett could now unseat his former boss, bringing an end to Netanyahu's run as the country's longest serving prime minister. Bennett has signed onto a historic coalition agreement with centrist leader Yair Lapid who brought together a wide swath of political parties as part of a change coalition to oust Netanyahu, including a far left party and even for the first time in Israeli history, an Arab-Israeli party. If Israel's parliament signs off on the deal in the coming days, Bennett will take the top job for the first two years of a four-year term, followed by Lapid. He will sit alongside politicians with completely opposing ideologies to his own.  Bennett lies to the right even of Netanyahu in several crucial areas. He would carry into office a history of incendiary remarks about Palestinians and a well-documented ambition to annex part of the occupied West Bank. Few Israelis voted for Bennett's Yamina party in March elections, picking up just 7 seats compared to Netanyahu's 30. But Bennett found himself the kingmaker, wooed by both Netanyahu and Lapid who needed his party's support in order to form a majority.  How much of his agenda Bennett can achieve while constrained in an awkwardly assembled coalition remains to be seen. But if the deal stands, the Yamina leader -- for so long a supporting character in Israel's high-stakes political spectacle -- could become a major player on the world scene. A staunch critic of the two-state solution Born in Haifa to immigrants from San Francisco, Bennett served in an elite unit of the Israel Defense Forces, before studying law at Hebrew University. He then became an entrepreneur, launching a tech start-up in 1999 which he later sold for $145 million.  He entered Israeli politics under Netanyahu's wing years later, though the two fell out after he was dismissed as chief of staff in 2008. Bennett made his own name nationally in 2013 as the leader of the pro-settler party Jewish Home, making his desire to prevent the formation of a Palestinian state a central plank of his pitch to voters.  After a merger with another party, he rebranded the party ""Yamina"" in 2019. Over the coming years Bennett held several posts in Netanyahu's various governments, including as minister of Defense, while continuing to outflank Netanyahu on issues relating to the Palestinian territories.  ""The old models of peace between Israel and the Palestinians are no longer relevant. The time has come to rethink the two-state solution,"" he wrote in a 2014 op-ed in the New York Times.  ""The era of these negotiations is over,"" he told CNN the same year. ""The approach that we've been trying for twenty years now clearly has reached its end.""  He has consistently held firm to his opposition to a two-state resolution since then, citing security and ideological concerns as his reasoning.  In 2018, he said that if he were defense minister, he would enact a ""shoot to kill"" policy on the border with Gaza. Asked if that would apply to children breaching the barrier, the Times of Israel reported that he replied: ""They are not children -- they are terrorists. We are fooling ourselves.""   During the most recent conflict between Israel and Hamas-led militants in Gaza, Bennett said the Palestinians could have turned Gaza ""into a paradise.""  ""They decided to turn it into a terrorist state,"" Bennett told CNN's Becky Anderson last month, before a ceasefire was agreed. ""The moment they decide that they don't want to annihilate us, this all ends."" Unlikely bedfellows Bennett has railed against government regulation of the private sector and labor unions.  ""If there is one thing I would want to achieve over the next four years, it is to break up the monopolies here and to break the stranglehold the big unions have on the Israeli economy,"" he told the Guardian in 2013.   On a handful of other issues, he is considered comparatively liberal. Despite his religious background, during the most recent electoral campaign he said that gay people should ""fully have all the civil rights a straight person in Israel has,"" the Times of Israel reported -- though he also said that didn't mean he would take action to ensure legal equality.  In recent months, Bennett has become a thorn in Netanyahu's side, fiercely criticizing his pandemic handling as well as the country's interminable political deadlock.  Four elections in two years have left the country in flux, with Netanyahu simultaneously appearing to be both stubbornly unmovable yet perpetually on the cusp of losing power.  Bennett told CNN last month that compared to his time in the tech sector and in the military, Israel's politics was ""quite a mess.""  ""After four elections and a further two months, it has been proven to all of us that there is simply no right-wing government possible that is headed by Netanyahu,"" Bennett said in a speech on Sunday, shortly before he reached a deal with Lapid, a man he now refers to as his ""friend.""  The two are unlikely bedfellows. A charismatic former TV anchor, Lapid has expressed support for a two-state solution with the Palestinians as well as moves to reduce the influence of religion in Israel, including by creating civil marriages.   How much of his personal ideology Bennett can enact, should he succeed in becoming prime minister, is an open question.  He has already hinted that the government would rely heavily on compromise to function. ""The left is making difficult compromises to allow me ... to become prime minister,"" he said Sunday. ""Everyone will have to postpone the realization of some of their dreams."" But in the coming days, Bennett will be focused on achieving a more immediate dream.  The coalition agreement must pass a vote of confidence in the Knesset, Israel's parliament, before a new government and Prime Minister are sworn in. According to Israeli law, the Knesset must also hold a vote of confidence within a week of being formally notified of a new government being formed. This step might not happen until Monday, which means the vote could be held as late as June 14. That means there's still time for Netanyahu and his allies to convince members of parliament to defect from the coalition, or somehow tie things up procedurally in parliament. A collapse of the ceasefire with the Hamas-led militants in Gaza or another outside event could also topple the burgeoning new government. But if Bennett and Lapid's coalition can hold firm, they would bring weeks (or years) of political maneuvering to a close -- and pull off a once improbable deal that would elevate Bennett to Israel's highest office.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",45,130.0,0.0637,0.8613,0.075,0.1292,0.063,0.846,0.091,0.9811,5.814,34.90120113636364,215.0,0.16233116807610995
"5 things to know for June 3: Coronavirus, cyberattacks, Israel, Capitol riots, Taliban",2021-06-03,"Add another unexpected pandemic effect to the list: According to a new study, lockdowns led to reduced crime in several global cities.  Here's what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.  (You can also get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Coronavirus President Joe Biden has announced a ""National Month of Action"" as part of a plan to get 70% of the US adult population at least partially vaccinated by July 4.  The White House initiative includes new outreach efforts to educate Americans about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines, new steps to make it easier to get the shot, and new vaccine incentives, like the possibility of free beer (really!). Biden has also finalized a long-awaited plan to distribute about 80 million coronavirus vaccines worldwide and is expected to release more details today or Friday. So far, the US has contributed about $2 billion to the World Health Organization vaccination effort, COVAX, and pledged another $2 billion between now and the end of 2022.  2. Cyberattacks JBS, the major meat supplier targeted by a cyberattack this week, is getting some of its North American and Australian plants up and running again. However, serious concerns remain about meat shortages and employee pay as well as the larger specter of similar attacks in the future. The White House says the ransomware attack likely originated from Russia, prompting Secretary of State Antony Blinken to say Russia has an obligation to curb hacking groups within the country. Biden will also discuss the attack with Russian President Vladimir Putin when the two meet later this month in Geneva. Yet another ransomware attack yesterday disrupted service for a Martha's Vineyard ferry in Cape Cod. The company says IT professionals are currently assessing the full impact of the attack. 3. Israel A coalition of Israeli political parties have agreed to a deal to form a new government, paving the way for the exit of Israel's longest serving prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. The coalition, which was fully organized just 38 minutes before a midnight deadline, marks a seismic event in recent Israeli political history. If the agreement holds, it would bring about the end of a long cycle of fruitless elections in the country, as well as the end of Netanyahu's 12 years in office. The coalition agreement must now pass a vote of confidence in the Knesset, Israel's parliament, before a new government and prime minister are sworn in. However, Netanyahu could still disrupt the process or convince some parties to defect from the bloc, since the only thing really holding them all together is the desire to oust Netanyahu and get a formal government on the books.  4. Capitol riots Renewed conversations among QAnon believers and supporters of former President Donald Trump are stoking fears of another event similar to January's Capitol riots. The social messaging platform Telegram has emerged as a particular source of concern among law enforcement officials, who say large groups of conspiracy theorists are entertaining false beliefs that Trump will somehow be reinstated as President in the coming months. Rhetoric from the Trump camp has reinforced these beliefs. Over the weekend, Michael Flynn, Trump's first national security adviser, appeared to endorse the idea of a Myanmar-style military coup in the US. A DC Metropolitan Police officer who was attacked during January's insurrection said comments like Flynn's could directly lead to more violence.   5. Taliban The United Nations Security Council is sounding the alarm over the threat posed by an emboldened Taliban in Afghanistan. With the last remaining US troops due to leave the country in the coming months, the UN Monitoring Team has concluded the Taliban remains close to al Qaeda, and could return to power in Afghanistan by force. As part of last year's agreement between the Trump administration and the Taliban, the militant Islamist organization promised to instruct its members ""not to cooperate with groups or individuals threatening the security of the United States and its allies"" in exchange for US troop withdrawal. That withdrawal is scheduled to be completed by September 11, but the UN Monitoring Team says there's no real indication the Taliban has kept its word.

"Israeli opposition parties strike coalition deal, paving the way for Netanyahu's exit",2021-06-02,"A coalition of Israeli political parties announced Wednesday night they had agreed ​to a deal to form a new government, paving the way for the exit of Israel's longest serving prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Yair Lapid, leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party, notified Israeli President Reuven Rivlin that he had managed to cobble together a coalition just 38 minutes before the midnight deadline. Though Lapid holds the mandate to form the government under the agreement, it is Naftali Bennett -- leader of the small right-wing party Yamina and the kingmaker in coalition talks -- who is set to become prime minister for the first two years of a four-year term. Lapid will serve as foreign minister until the two men swap roles halfway through the term. In a statement, Lapid said the ""government will work to serve all the citizens of Israel including those who aren't members of it, will respect those who oppose it, and do everything in its power to unite all parts of Israeli society."" The deal is a seismic event in recent Israeli political history as it could spell the final days of Netanyahu's 12 years in office.  The coalition agreement must now pass a vote of confidence in the Knesset, Israel's parliament, before a new government and prime minister are sworn in.  The new government ​consists of a number of parties from across the political spectrum, from the left-wing Meretz to Bennett's right-wing Yamina party.  In a historic moment, the small Islamist party United Arab List also decided to join the coalition, the first time an Arab-Israeli party has joined a coalition. The party is unlikely to have a minister in the government, but will have negotiated with the coalition on issues important to them.   Not much unites the parties other than their desire to oust Netanyahu, and the parties differ in their stances on some of the country's most pressing issues, especially relations with the Palestinians.  Bennett is the son of American immigrants and a former elite commando in the Israeli military who made millions in the Israeli tech industry. He previously served as defense, economy and education minister under Netanyahu, but is politically even more right-wing than the longtime Israeli leader on certain issues, especially pertaining to relations with Palestinians. But he's more moderate when it comes to social issues such as LGBTQ rights. Bennett once led a West Bank settler organization and has previously said he did not believe in a two-state solution that would establish a state for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. Israelis have gone to the polls four times over the past two years, as election after election failed to break the political deadlock. Bennett said in a speech on Sunday that he was willing to sit in a coalition with parties on the opposite end of the political spectrum in order to prevent a fifth round of elections and to pull Israel out of its ""tailspin."" After the March elections, the Israeli President had tasked Netanyahu to form a government after the vote with​in 28 days, per election law. But the Prime Minister was unable to command enough support to control a ​minimum of 61 seats in Israel's 120-seat parliament, the Knesset.  The President then tasked Lapid with forming a government. The talks appeared to fall apart two days into the latest conflict with Hamas-led militants in Gaza last month when Bennett announced he was suspending negotiations due to the violence. But a few days after the ceasefire was reached following 11 bloody days, Bennett and Lapid reignited negotiations.  According to Israeli law, the Knesset must hold a vote of confidence within a week of being formally notified of a new government being formed. This step might not happen until Monday, which means the vote could be held as late as June 14. That means there's still time for Netanyahu and his allies to convince people to defect from the bloc, or somehow tie things up procedurally in parliament. A collapse of the ceasefire with the Hamas-led militants in Gaza or another outside event could also topple the burgeoning new government.  In the meantime, Netanyahu remains prime minister until someone else is sworn in. Beyond losing his role as leader of Israel's government, Netanyahu faces perhaps an even greater threat: an ongoing trial on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust -- charges he denies.  If Netanyahu is ousted, it could put to an end any political attempts to circumvent the trial and possible jail time by appointing a new attorney general, or by influencing the appointment of certain judges who could affect his trial, experts said.  Netanyahu blasted Bennett on Sunday for committing what he called the ""fraud of the century,"" portraying him as a power-hungry politician who ""only cares about himself."" It was a statement that some Israeli political watchers found to be more than ironic, considering Netanyahu's past political maneuvers.","{'neg': 0.106, 'neu': 0.704, 'pos': 0.19, 'compound': 0.296}",30,132.0,0.05709090909090909,0.8667272727272728,0.07618181818181818,0.09914999999999999,0.065,0.842,0.094,0.8494,2.9744999999999995,53.29032916666667,201.0,0.2651260157545606
Midnight deadline approaches for Israeli coalition to unite and challenge Netanyahu,2021-06-02,"A coalition of Israeli opposition parties were approaching a midnight deadline on Wednesday to form a government, in the most serious challenge yet to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's rule.  The idea that Israel's longest-serving leader could be unseated became a reality on Sunday, when Naftali Bennett, leader of the small right-wing party Yamina, confirmed he was working toward a coalition agreement with Yair Lapid, leader of the centrist party Yesh Atid.  Under the country's election laws, the president can give a party leader 28 days to form a coalition. President Reuven Rivlin had tasked Netanyahu to form a government after the vote, but the Prime Minister was unable to command enough support to control Israel's parliament, the Knesset. ​ The president then tasked Lapid with forming a government, with the deadline of midnight Wednesday. Bennett and Lapid will try to form a coalition with at least eight political parties that run the political spectrum -- from the left wing Meretz, to Bennett's right wing Yamina party. They will also likely need the outside support of a small Islamist party called United Arab List in order to be able to reach the 61-seat threshold for a governing majority in the 120-seat parliament. If a deal is agreed, parliament will then have a week to vote on any coalition arrangements before a new government and prime minister is sworn in. If Bennet and Lapid fail to meet Wednesday's deadline, the mandate to form a government falls to parliament. If a government isn't formed within the following 21 days, Israel would be on course for a fifth election in just over two years. A source involved in coalition negotiations told CNN Wednesday that very significant progress had been made overnight and that nearly everything was done. One sticking point is who will sit on the judicial appointments committee. ​ Lapid's Yesh Atid came in second in inconclusive March 23 elections behind Netanyahu's right-wing Likud.  Bennett's party won only seven seats in the March vote, but the leader nonetheless finds himself in the powerful role of kingmaker. He had previously announced he was working with Lapid, but had backtracked two days into Israel's latest conflict with Hamas-led militants in Gaza. A few days after the ceasefire was announced, the pair were back at the negotiating table. The parties in the new coalition differ in their stances on some of the country's most pressing issues, especially on relations with Palestinians. But in his speech Sunday, Bennett said he was willing to sit with parties with opposing ideological views to prevent weary Israeli voters from going through another election. Netanyahu blasted Bennett on Sunday for committing what he called the ""fraud of the century,"" portraying him as a power hungry politician who ""only cares about himself.""  The political challenge comes as Netanyahu remains on trial, charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust, charges that Netanyahu denies.

The bad news about Iran's presidential candidates,2021-06-01,"The list of candidates for the June 18 Iranian presidential election is out, and it's worse than anyone hoping for a moderate leader could have imagined. The top candidate is the chief justice of Iran, Ebrahim Raisi, a thorough hard-liner and the favorite of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.     Khamenei, who oversees the Guardian Council that approves the candidate list, is not leaving this critical election to chance. Last time, the supreme leader's willingness to admit moderates -- at least in Iranian terms -- to the list of candidates led to Raisi's 2017 defeat at the hands of Hassan Rouhani, the two-term incumbent who is not eligible to stand for reelection. Now, there will be no viable moderate candidate on the ballot. Raisi seems to be a shoo-in.   What this likely means is a lower turnout as calls to boycott the polls gain ground. There's no need to fix the actual balloting since there doesn't seem to be anyone on the list that most of the electorate really wants to vote for. Still, the leadership will go through the motions -- three nationally televised presidential debates with all seven candidates on the stage and full-bore campaigning until two days before the election.   Alongside Raisi will be other figures that are either little known or hardly beloved by most of the electorate -- former Revolutionary Guards chief Mohsen Rezaei, former chief nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili, deputy parliament speaker Amir Hossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi, former vice president Mohsen Mehralizadeh, central bank governor Abdolnaser Hemmati, and a member of parliament, Alireza Zakani. A host of others -- 600 are reported to have thrown their hats in the ring -- including a number of moderates and well-known figures, especially former parliament speaker Ali Larijani and the incumbent vice president, avowed reformist Eshaq Jahangiri. The former two-term president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was also excluded, which led him to announce he'd be boycotting the vote.    Raisi's hard-line credentials are impeccable. He has had ties with the supreme leader since his student days in the holy city of Qom and was a member of the so-called ""Death Commission,"" which presided over the summary execution of thousands of political prisoners after the Iran-Iraq war ended in 1988. His 2019 appointment by Khamenei to lead Iran's judiciary drew fire from human rights groups and the US State Department.    Most importantly, Raisi is said to share with Khamenei a deep dislike for the 2015 multinational Iran nuclear agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and a reluctance to renew it, certainly not in any form that would resemble what negotiators in Vienna have been considering for weeks. Agreement from Tehran is essential if Iran is to return to compliance on its nuclear program and the West, especially the United States, is to ease sanctions in turn for Iranian assurances of good faith.     This is the highest single stake in the Iranian elections. Western negotiators are clearly aware that if they don't reach an agreement on a renewed pact before the pro-accord Rouhani leaves office, it is possible that no viable agreement will be reached at all.    Some tense and ominous signals already abound. Two Iranian naval vessels -- a frigate and the massive Makran, an oil tanker converted to a forward staging platform -- have been spotted headed down the east coast of Africa and may be bound for Venezuela, another oil-producing nation and nascent Iranian ally. Both nations are in the grip of American sanctions for their activities. According to Politico, officials in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas have been told that welcoming these ships would be a mistake, but the two vessels continued steaming forward.   At the same time, Israel seems on track to replace Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with a new coalition government led by several of his determined foes. Since Naftali Bennett, the most likely new prime minister if Netanyahu is forced out, is an ultranationalist who once advocated prolonged airstrikes against Gaza and more recently espoused an ""Octopus"" doctrine advocating that Iran, rather than its proxies, should be targeted on a broad range of activities, it is not clear what that would mean for any shift in the Israeli position on the Iran nuclear agreement. Bennett has been an especially vocal opponent of the deal, proclaiming after its announcement that ""a terrorist nuclear superpower is born, and it will go down as one of the darkest days in world history.""   Of course, had former President Donald Trump not withdrawn precipitously from the agreement the year after he was inaugurated, many of these issues would be moot. If there is no new agreement in Vienna and a new Iranian government walks out of the Vienna talks, Trump and Netanyahu will have won. Both of these leaders found the agreement one-sided, arguing that it gave Iran free rein to support terrorism and inch its way toward a deliverable nuclear weapon. Netanyahu had actually suggested he would have been prepared to mount an armed attack on Iran's nuclear works.    Now, President Joe Biden's desire to return to the pact could become more difficult, if not impossible, if Iran and Israel both shift even further to the right.     Iran wants an immediate end to all sanctions before it begins any return to compliance with the old agreement. Israel wants sanctions to force Iran to its knees. Neither remotely approaches a workable formula.    So, this is by most standards simply the ""Worst of Times."" All that can be hoped is that a calm, reasonable position from Biden and his accomplished Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who have expressed willingness to lift some sanctions in return for an expanded agreement, will find a way of helping both sides appreciate the bad hand the losers will be holding.","{'neg': 0.368, 'neu': 0.632, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.5423}",35,134.0,0.1,0.78825,0.11224999999999999,-0.001125000000000001,0.09,0.793,0.118,0.9699,-0.039375000000000035,32.69969166666667,168.0,0.19464102182539686
"5 things to know for June 1: White House, Covid-19, voting laws, Israel, climate",2021-06-01,"Rabbit, rabbit! It's a new month, which means a brand new chance to make your own luck. Why do we say rabbit rabbit, anyway?  Here's what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.  (You can also get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. White House The White House is cranking up pressure as talks drag on with Republicans over President Biden's ambitious yet divisive infrastructure plans. The administration had hoped for a deal on the proposal, originally tagged at $2.2 trillion, by Memorial Day. However, there's still a $700 billion gap between Biden's original proposal and the GOP's counterproposals. There are fears among the President's allies that this ongoing inertia could lead to a ""summer slump"" that often happens in the first year of a presidency, when unanticipated challenges at home and abroad slow down the early months of a president's legislative momentum.   2. Coronavirus Half the US population is now at least partially vaccinated, which means health experts are less concerned about the crowds that gathered at beaches, bars and other venues over the holiday weekend. Still, they warn that those who aren't vaccinated remain at great risk of serious illness from Covid-19. The next goal? Biden wants to get 70% of the population at least partially vaccinated by July 4. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization has assigned new labels to key coronavirus variants so the public can refer to them by letters of the Greek alphabet instead of where the variant was first detected. For instance, the UK variant that made its way around the US is now variant Alpha, and the one responsible for India's most recent deadly surge is Delta. 3. Voting laws Texas has become the next battleground in the voting rights fight after state Democrats successfully derailed a restrictive voting bill. Legislators walked off the state House floor late Sunday night, leaving majority Republicans without the quorum they needed to approve the bill before a midnight deadline. The bill would make mail-in voting more difficult, ban early voting on Sunday mornings and prohibit local elections officials from sending out absentee ballot applications to anyone who has not requested one. The measure may be dead for now, but Gov. Greg Abbott made it clear the issue will be top of mind during the next legislative session. States like Georgia and Florida have already passed similarly restrictive voting measures based on falsehoods promoted by former President Trump that the outcome of the 2020 election was somehow fraudulent.  4. Israel Benjamin Netanyahu's 12-year tenure as Israeli Prime Minister could be coming to an end after two political rivals announced they are working toward forming a new government in the Knesset, the country's parliament. Naftali Bennett, leader of the small right-wing party Yamina, said he is working toward a coalition deal with centrist party leader Yair Lapid to avoid a fifth round of elections, the prior of which have failed to produce a new government. If successful, Netanyahu -- who faces an ongoing trial on bribery and fraud charges -- will be ousted as Israel's longest-serving PM. Lapid now needs to reach and sign formal coalition agreements with the eight parties involved. Parliament then has a week to vote on the coalition arrangements before the new government -- and a new Israeli prime minister -- could be sworn in.   5. Weather Today marks the start of the Atlantic hurricane season, but the first named storm is already in the books. Subtropical Storm Ana formed in the Atlantic 10 days ago, marking the seventh year in a row when at least one named storm formed prior to the official start of the season. Hurricanes are getting deadlier and deadlier as oceans and the air around them heat up due to the climate crisis. Rising sea levels also raise the risk of destructive storm surges. As we gear up for another potentially dangerous season, Amazon and the Red Cross are partnering on a new disaster hub that will allow for a faster response to locations hit by hurricanes and other natural disasters.

"Is it finally the end for Benjamin Netanyahu, the great survivor of Israeli politics?",2021-05-31,"A quarter of a century ago, Israelis were stunned when Benjamin Netanyahu narrowly beat Shimon Peres to become Israel's youngest-ever Prime Minister.  On Sunday, the anniversary of that first win in 1996, Netanyahu addressed the country as he faced the possibility of the end of his political career after his former lieutenant, Naftali Bennett, announced he would work with opposition leader Yair Lapid to form a new government.  Blasting Bennett, leader of the small right-wing party Yamina, for committing what he called the ""fraud of the century,"" Netanyahu portrayed him as a power hungry politician who ""only cares about himself."" It was a statement that some Israeli political watchers found to be more than ironic considering Netanyahu's past political maneuvers. The announcement came after Bennett had already once announced he was working with Lapid, only to backtrack two days into Israel's latest conflict with Hamas-led militants in Gaza. But a few days after the ceasefire was announced, Bennett was back at the negotiating table with Lapid.  Bennett and Lapid, who heads the centrist party Yesh Atid, will try to form a coalition with at least eight political parties that run the political spectrum; from the left wing Meretz, to Bennett's right wing Yamina party. They will also likely need the outside support of a small Islamist party called United Arab List in order to be able to have a governing majority in Israel's parliament, the Knesset. The new coalition will not see eye-to-eye on many of the most pressing issues facing Israel, especially on Israeli relations with Palestinians. But in his speech Sunday, Bennett said he's willing to sit with parties with opposing ideological views as his in order to prevent Israel from going through a fifth round of elections in just over two years.  It is widely believed that as part of the deal, Bennett will serve first as prime minister, followed by Lapid.  Now Lapid needs to formally sign coalition agreements with the various parties before presenting his new government to Israeli President Reuven Rivlin. Then the Knesset needs to vote and approve the new government before it can be formally sworn in.   Beyond losing his role as leader of Israel's government, Netanyahu faces perhaps an even greater threat if the new government is sworn in: an ongoing trial on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust.  Netanyahu has denied all the charges, describing them as a media-fueled witch hunt against him. He insists he wants the case to run its course, confident it will crumble.  But political analysts say that by staying in power, Netanyahu could avoid prosecution and possible jail time by appointing a new attorney general, or by influencing the appointment of certain judges who could affect his trial. Other critics of the Israeli leader say he wants to pass a new immunity law that would protect a sitting prime minister from being indicted. While it appears that Bennett and Lapid have enough support to be able to form a new government and oust Netanyahu after 12 consecutive years in power, their new government is still several steps away.  And if Israeli political history is a guide, things can change quickly and dramatically. The new government is sitting on a thin margin, just a few defections could topple their chances. A collapse of the ceasefire with Hamas-led militants in Gaza, or a terrorist attack could also completely change the calculations.  As The Times of Israel's editor David Horovitz observed on the news outlet's podcast on Sunday, Netanyahu has been written off so many times before, only to survive.  ""The time to say it's for real will only be when that vote is cast and the votes have been counted and Netanyahu is no longer leading the coalition,"" Horovitz said. ""We're not there yet, we're apparently very close to it but we're not there yet."" ​","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.645, 'pos': 0.355, 'compound': 0.765}",26,136.0,0.11580000000000001,0.8314,0.052700000000000004,-0.16243333333333335,0.089,0.821,0.09,-0.3898,-4.223266666666667,-13.572041666666665,158.0,-0.08589899789029536
"Benjamin Netanyahu, the longest-running Israeli prime minister, could be ousted in days after rivals agree to work on unity government",2021-05-30,"Benjamin Netanyahu's run as the longest-serving Israeli prime minister may be coming to an end.  Naftali Bennett, leader of the small right-wing party Yamina, announced Sunday evening he is working toward a coalition agreement with Yair Lapid, leader of the centrist party Yesh Atid, to join a new government.  It's a seismic event in Israeli politics, and if the coalition is sworn in, it would bring an end to Netanyahu's 12 years as prime minister.  In a prime-time address Sunday, Bennett told Israelis he is joining the new government to prevent a fifth round of elections and ""rescue the country from spin."" ""After four elections and a further two months, it has been proven to all of us that there is simply no right-wing government possible that is headed by Netanyahu. It is either a fifth election or a unity government,"" Bennett said. He dismissed suggestions that the coalition, which would include a wide swath of parties, would be a left-wing government, instead paying tribute to the readiness of potential partners in the coalition to allow him to become Israel's leader. ""The left is making difficult compromises to allow me ... to become prime minister,"" he said, adding, ""This government will not do disengagement nor will it hand over territories, nor will it be afraid to launch a military operation if required."" A short while after Bennett spoke, Netanyahu made a statement of his own in which he denounced the Yamina party leader as a man who cared about nothing other than becoming prime minister. Reminding Israelis that before the March election Bennett had said he would not sit in a government led by Lapid, Netanyahu said his right-wing rival's principles did not have the weight of a feather. Bennett was trying to pull off the ""deception of the century,"" Netanyahu said. It is widely expected that any unity agreement would see the position of prime minister rotate with Bennett going first and Lapid second. It's an unusual arrangement, one made unique by the fact that Bennett's party won only seven seats in the last election. But his party became one of the kingmakers in Israeli politics, as both Netanyahu and the pro-""change"" bloc tried to woo Bennett, needing his seven seats to get them closer to the 61-seat majority needed to form a government in the Knesset, the Israeli parliament. The ""change"" coalition will likely be made up of parties from the right to the left of Israeli politics, but it would still almost certainly need some sort of outside support to reach the 61-seat threshold. That support may come from outside the government, such as one of the Arab parties, most likely the Islamist United Arab List, led by Mansour Abbas. And there may not be much uniting such a wide range of parties other than in their desire to oust Netanyahu. With pressing issues such as how to keep the ceasefire holding with Hamas-led militants in Gaza and rising tensions in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, this could be a fragile government easily broken apart by ideological divisions. Lapid now needs to reach and sign formal coalition agreements with all of the parties before announcing his coalition, first to Israel's President and then the speaker of the Knesset. Parliament then has a week to vote on the coalition arrangements before the new government, and a new Israeli prime minister, could be sworn in.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.884, 'pos': 0.116, 'compound': 0.3612}",20,137.0,0.03375,0.8974999999999999,0.06875,0.28418,0.025,0.853,0.122,0.9936,5.6836,-10.862941666666666,148.0,-0.0733982545045045
Israel's political stalemate is unmoved by the conflict with Hamas,2021-05-26,"Hours before the first rockets were fired toward Jerusalem two weeks ago, the bloc of political parties trying to oust long-term Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from power was cautiously optimistic. The group, led by former TV anchor Yair Lapid of the centrist Yesh Atid party, would be able to form a government within a week or two, or so they thought. But then just after 6 p.m. on May 10, Hamas militants fired a barrage of rockets from Gaza into Israel, setting off air raid sirens not heard in Jerusalem for years. Soon after, Israel launched airstrikes against what it said were militant targets in Gaza. A bloody 11-day conflict was set in motion and the landscape of Israeli politics shifted.  Two days later, Naftali Bennett, the leader of the small right wing party Yamina, announced he could no longer negotiate with Lapid's ""change"" coalition, because it would rely on the participation of a small Islamist party called Ra'am. Without Bennett, Lapid's bloc would be short of the numbers needed to form a government. ""If it were not for the eruption of violence, then probably today we would have a different government in place,"" said Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute. If Lapid isn't able to form a government by June 2, Israeli President Reuven Rivlin will send the mandate to the Knesset, the Israeli parliament where a member would need the backing of at least 61 members to form a government.   If the parliament is unable to nominate someone who can successfully form a government, then the country will head to yet another election later this year -- the fifth since April 2019. It would also mean that Israel will remain in the same political state it is in now, ruled by a dysfunctional unity government led by Netanyahu, until a new government is successfully formed. Netanyahu, who hosted US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday, has been on trial since last May on bribery, fraud and breach of trust charges, all of which he denies. Yet the Israeli political situation is so atrophied that public opinion appears to have been barely moved by the conflict with Hamas or the eruption of intercommunal violence in mixed Arab and Jewish cities across the country. Plesner said that in times of conflict, Israelis tend to rally behind the Israel Defense Forces and political leaders, expecting politicians to refrain from infighting. But such situations also radicalize public opinion, he added. ""People are less likely to accept solutions of compromise. Emotions of fear, distrust, and vengeance are becoming dominant and obviously that has a political effect of strengthening not voices of moderation, but rather radical voices generally on both ends of the spectrum,"" Plesner said. Two polls released just three days after the ceasefire was announced on May 20 suggest that the long-running political stalemate remains even after the conflict, and that Netanyahu and his Likud party got little or no political bounce out of the conflict with Hamas.  The polls by two of Israel's leading news channels 12 and 13, also suggest about half of Israelis believe neither side won the conflict, with 54% of Channel 13 respondents and 50% of Channel 12 respondents choosing that option. Similarly, just under half of respondents in both polls (48% for Channel 13 and 47% for Channel 12) opposed the ceasefire and said the operation should have continued. Jason Pearlman, a media adviser who has worked both with Israel's president and a number of Israeli political figures including Bennett, said the events of the past few weeks would not dramatically alter the results of an election if it were to be repeated, only bringing ""the problems into sharper focus."" ""In other words, if [a 'change' government] was possible before, it still is. If it was impossible before, it still is. We're just now even more painfully aware of why,"" he said.","{'neg': 0.204, 'neu': 0.796, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.3182}",23,138.0,0.11325,0.7934999999999999,0.09325,-0.05799999999999997,0.108,0.83,0.062,-0.9908,-1.3339999999999992,-12.753441666666665,151.0,-0.08445987858719646
"US will make 'significant contributions' to rebuilding Gaza, Blinken says",2021-05-25,"The United States will make ""significant contributions"" to rebuild Gaza and reopen its consulate in Jerusalem following the recent conflict between Israel and Hamas, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on the first day of his first official visit to the region. Blinken, speaking alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem, said the US would ""work to ensure that Hamas does not benefit"" from the aid  Blinken's meeting with Netanyahu and other senior Israeli officials marked the first stop on a trip to the Middle East. HIs visit comes on the heels of the worst violence in years between Israel and Hamas. Israeli strikes during the recent conflict killed at least 248 Palestinians, including 66 children, according to Hamas health officials. At least 12 people in Israel, including two children, were killed by Palestinian militant fire from Gaza, according to Israel's military and the emergency service. Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire on Friday, after 11 days of conflict. Speaking on Tuesday, Blinken said the losses on both sides in the conflict between Israel and Hamas were ""profound."" ""Casualties are often reduced to numbers. But behind every number is a human being -- a daughter, a son, a father, a mother, a grandparent, a best friend. And as the Talmud teaches, to lose a life is to lose the whole world, whether that life is Palestinian or Israeli,"" Blinken said.  Blinken said he and Netanyahu had a detailed discussion about Israel's security needs, including re-supplying the Iron Dome aerial defense system with rocket interceptors. Blinken also spoke about the right of Israelis and Palestinians, who he said ""equally deserve to live safely and securely, to enjoy equal measures of freedom, opportunity and democracy, to be treated with dignity,"" but he did not specifically mention the two-state solution or suggest that comprehensive peace negotiations were imminent. Netanyahu used the meeting to urge the US not to return to the Iran nuclear deal known as the JCPOA. He said the deal would allow Iran to develop nuclear weapons, and said Israel reserved the right to defend itself. In response, Blinken said only that Washington would ""continue to consult"" with Israel as indirect talks between Iran and the US continue in Vienna, Austria. Biden administration to reopen US consulate in Jerusalem Blinken also met with the Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah later on Tuesday.  Following that meeting, Blinken announced that the Biden administration will be reopening the US consulate in Jerusalem and providing $5.5 million in immediate disaster assistance to Gaza as well as additional new assistance to the Palestinian people. Blinken said that opening the consulate, which was closed during the Trump administration and serves as the primary diplomatic post for US-Palestinian relations, is an important way for the US to ""engage with and provide support to the Palestinian people."" ""I am here to underscore the commitment of the US to rebuilding a relationship to the Palestinian Authority and with the Palestinian people,"" the top US diplomat said. ""A relationship built on mutual respect and also a shared conviction that Palestinians and Israelis alike deserve equal measures of freedom, security, opportunity and dignity."" The US is working with the UN, the international community, the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli government to assist in recovery and relief efforts in Gaza. Blinken said these efforts are ""urgent."" Blinken said the US will work with partners to be sure that Hamas does not benefit from these reconstruction efforts.  ""Asking all of us to help rebuild Gaza only makes sense if there is confidence that what is rebuilt is not lost again because Hamas decides to launch more rocket attacks in the future,"" he added.  Abbas could be heard saying ""yes"" when he made that statement.  In addition to the immediate disaster relief, the Biden administration is providing $75 million in development and economic assistance to the Palestinians this year and $32 million for UNRWA's emergency humanitarian appeal. The Trump administration shut off economic assistance to the Palestinian Authority and to UNRWA and the Biden administration already pledged to resume that support.  Ceasefire 'not enough' Blinken also said the US welcomes the ceasefire holding but said that is ""not enough."" He said the last round of violence was symptomatic of a ""larger set of issues that we have to address if we are going to prevent its occurrence."" He also conveyed the ""deep condolences"" of the US to the families of those who lost loved ones in recent violence. ""I say this as a father, no child whether Israeli or Palestinian or American is a statistic. We know the human consequences when violence takes the upper hand and we are determined that that not be the case. The loss of any child is a universe of loss and in some ways incomprehensible except to those who suffered the loss,"" Blinken said. Abbas thanked the Biden administration for the resumption of assistance to UNRWA, for its commitment to a two-state solution and for its position on the expansion of settlements. He also said the Palestinian government stands ready to work on the reconstruction of Gaza and to establish a national unity government.

Blinken: 'There has to be' a prospect for a peaceful political solution between Israel and Palestinians,2021-05-23,"Secretary of State Antony Blinken insisted Sunday that there will eventually be a prospect for a peaceful political solution between Israel and the Palestinians, saying one must come following a ""critical"" ceasefire declared in the region last week.   ""I think there has to be. I think both sides are reminded that we have to find a way to break the cycle, because if we don't it will repeat itself at great cost,"" Blinken told CNN's Fareed Zakaria on ""GPS"" when asked if he thinks there is a prospect of some kind of movement toward a genuine political solution.  In a separate interview Sunday with ABC News, Blinken credited the Biden administration's ""relentless, determined, but quiet diplomacy"" in the region, saying it's ""what got us to where we needed to be.""  The comments come several days after Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas agreed to a ceasefire following more than a week of conflict that left hundreds dead, most of them Palestinians. Blinken, who told ABC that the ceasefire was ""critical,"" said the US is now pivoting to ""dealing with the grave humanitarian situation in Gaza.""  ""Then reconstruction, rebuilding what's been lost, and critically, engaging both sides in trying to start to make real improvements ... so that Israelis and Palestinians can live with equal measures of security of peace and of dignity,"" he told the network.  Blinken also refused to say whether the Biden administration would pursue the proposed peace deal brokered under then-President Donald Trump and spearheaded by his son-in-law and former White House senior adviser Jared Kushner.  ""I don't think we're at the -- in a place where the getting to some kind of negotiation for what ultimately I think has to be the result, which is a two-state solution, is the first order of business,"" he said. ""We have to start building back in concrete ways and offering some genuine hope, prospects, opportunities in the lives of people.""  Pressed on whether the US still endorses the plan, Blinken again wouldn't answer directly, saying: ""We're going to look at everything that has been done before, learn from that just as we have in other areas, and see what makes sense and what doesn't.""  When he proposed the plan, Trump claimed it was a ""realistic two-state solution,"" but the plan caters to nearly every major Israeli demand and was immediately rejected by Palestinians. Blinken was also critical of Hamas, saying the group had brought ""nothing but ruin to the Palestinian people,"" and asserted that President Joe Biden has been ""clear we're committed to giving Israel the means to defend itself, especially when it comes to these indiscriminate rocket attacks against civilians.""  The secretary plans to travel to the Middle East to meet with ""Israeli, Palestinian, and regional counterparts in the coming days to discuss recovery efforts and working together to build better futures for Israelis and Palestinians,"" State Department spokesperson Ned Price said Thursday in a readout of a call between Blinken and Israeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi.  Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders also weighed in on the issue on Sunday, telling CBS News that he thinks the US needs to develop an ""even-handed approach"" to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and expressed hope that Biden is on the same page. When asked whether he thinks the Biden administration is being an apologist for the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Sanders pointed to the ""incredible suffering"" in Gaza in the wake of the recent violent conflict and said, ""We have to be pro-Israel, but we have to be pro-Palestinian."" Sanders introduced a resolution last week disapproving of the US sale of $735 million in precision-guided weapons to Israel and said that he would ""absolutely"" like to see the same conditions placed on aid from the US to Palestinians to ensure Hamas does not receive American support.

He couldn't take Trump's lies anymore,2021-05-23,"Stephen Richer tried to stay out of it.

Richer is a Republican who won his post on an unlikely platform: to make the ""Maricopa County Recorder's Office Boring Again,"" he wrote. But after the county's 2020 votes were checked and rechecked, confirming Joe Biden's victory, Arizona Senate Republicans launched a questionable ""audit"" of the ballots by a cybersecurity company. Conspiracy theorists supporting former President Donald Trump's baseless vote fraud narrative cooked up bizarre claims -- of ""fake ballots flown in from South Korea"" and of a deleted election database.  When Trump himself piled on with a statement repeating the lie about the missing database, Richer decided he had had enough -- and tweeted, ""this is unhinged."" ""It was time to loudly speak up to defend my name, my team's name and the county's name. It was also time to loudly speak the truth,"" he wrote.  ""The truth is that there is no solid evidence of significant fraud in Maricopa County's November 3 election. There is no solid evidence that the election in Maricopa County was stolen from former President Trump.

But the future chairman of the People's Republic of China also declared, ""Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.""   With his vicious, take-no-prisoners view of politics, Mao might not be surprised at the findings of a new study conducted in the battleground state of North Carolina, where researchers reported Thursday that ""exposure to a stressful political election, such as the 2016 US presidential election, was associated with a 77% increase in the risk of cardiac arrhythmia in people with underlying cardiovascular disease."" That election, they wrote, ""stands out as a historic event because of the unprecedented levels of anxiety, animosity, and partisan rhetoric throughout the campaign and the polarized reactions to the unexpected election results.""  But 2016 turned out to be only a prelude to the even more traumatic events that followed the 2020 election -- and more than four months after the January 6 invasion of the US Capitol by former President Donald Trump's supporters, Congress still hasn't decided how to investigate it.  This week, the Republican leaders of the House and Senate declared their opposition to creating a commission to investigate the riot, in which police were beaten, lawmakers cowered in fear for their lives and five people died.   ""The continuing effort to throw sand in the eyes of history -- to gaslight the American people about what happened that day -- is a thundering alarm about the future of America's democracy,"" wrote Frida Ghitis. ""When a country has just lived through a coup attempt, it should urgently, honestly, examine what occurred ... Trump and many of his backers maliciously insist the election was stolen. If they have their way, the next coup attempt may not fail.""  Fareed Zakaria observed that ""the modern Republican Party has its roots in rebellion -- rebellion against the main currents of change in modern American society: the growth of the welfare state, the secularization of life and the increasing diversity of American society."" Most Americans ""don't agree with that protest,"" but GOP leaders are left ""riding the back of a tiger and they can't get off"" since leaders like Trump ""whip up their followers into a froth of hysteria."" The result, in Zakaria's view: the party becomes ""a band of ideological warriors with apocalyptic vision that fears the ends of days, sees opponents as devils and traitors and believes that all methods are sanctioned in its battle to save civilization and itself.""  The party's former national chairman, Richard N. Bond, wrote that Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy is performing ""a political high-wire act worthy of the legendary Flying Wallendas,"" as he seeks ""to retain the loyalty of millions of Republican voters still wedded to former President Donald Trump. On the other hand, McCarthy needs to avoid going down the surreal and dangerous rabbit hole created by Trump and his 'Big Lie' of a stolen election.""

A ceasefire halted the 11-day conflict between Israel and Hamas. The big question is what happens now -- not only in the Middle East, but also in the US, where the politics of support for Israel have changed.  ""There are no winners in the current battle between Hamas and Israel,"" Dean Obeidallah wrote a week ago. ""If history serves as a guide ... after a ceasefire is reached, the conflict will slowly fade from the headlines, the world will go back to its business and the Palestinians will largely be forgotten -- yet again. For those who sincerely want to see a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, this time must be different. The world, and especially the Biden administration, cannot look away but must engage on the question of Palestine. It's 2021 -- a homeland for Palestinian Christians and Muslims is long overdue, as is safety and equality for Palestinians.""  The hostilities put a spotlight on the ""Abraham Accords,"" negotiated by Trump's senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner. ""Kushner's plan was predicated on a fantasy,"" wrote Peter Bergen, ""that peace would be achieved by negotiating without the Palestinians and instead by creating warmer relations between the Arab states and Israel. In Kushner's analysis, the road to peace in Israel ran not through Gaza, Jerusalem and the West Bank, but through the United Arab Emirates."" Bergen added, ""Trump's Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin claimed that investments in the West Bank and Gaza were 'going to be like a hot I.P.O.,' evoking the Wall Street phrase for an initial public offering of stock. Instead of a hot I.P.O., there is now a hot war."" Samuel G. Freedman noted that ""the accords reinforced the notion on the right-wing in both Israel and America that somehow the century-long Palestinian national movement had all but disappeared."" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's embrace of Trump helped erode support for Israel among American Jews, Freedman wrote. ""By aligning Israel with both the Republican Party and the Christian right, Netanyahu tacitly associated it with a series of positions on American domestic issues that are anathema to the preponderance of American Jews who reliably vote Democratic -- outlawing abortion, rolling back gay rights, eradicating Obamacare, suppressing voting, and, of course, attempting to seize power through insurrection."" In The New York Times, Thomas Friedman argued that there's a symbiotic relationship between Netanyahu, whose nickname is Bibi, and the leaders of Hamas. Israel's prime minister ""and Hamas each exploited or nurtured their own mobs to prevent an unprecedented national unity government from emerging in Israel -- a cabinet that for the first time would have included Israeli Jews and Israeli Arab Muslims together ... No, Hamas and Bibi don't talk. They don't need to. They each understand what the other needs to stay in power and consciously or unconsciously behave in ways to ensure that they deliver it.""

Biden weathers his first foreign crisis after months focusing on domestic troubles,2021-05-22,"It was before 8 a.m. ET on Wednesday and President Joe Biden was on the phone with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the fourth time in a week. Outside, Biden's helicopter was idling as he ran behind schedule. Amid the flurry of 80 calls between Washington and the Middle East, this one had not been planned in advance, according to a person familiar with the matter. Awaking early at the White House to reports of intensified airstrikes against targets in Gaza, Biden had a distinctly sharper message for Netanyahu than what he had relayed previously. After seven days of holding off public comment, officials said the President's patience was wearing thin. The conversation was described by people familiar with the matter as ""candid,"" ""direct"" and ""firm"" -- all the diplomatic bywords for tense. Previously, Biden had pressed Netanyahu for his objectives and endgame in bombing Gaza, questions officials say did not yield clear answers. This time, he expressed more conviction that he expected the bombing to conclude. More than a day later, Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire. Even after Netanyahu called Biden back to inform him of the development, the President and his aides remained skeptical. It would take another phone call from the Prime Minister later that afternoon -- their sixth in 11 days -- to convince Biden the truce was real. ""One of the reasons why we were able to do the ceasefire in 11 days is I didn't do what other people have done. I don't talk about what I tell people in private. I don't talk about what we negotiate in private,"" Biden said on Friday as the ceasefire entered its second day, taking credit for a strategy he suggested eluded his predecessors -- including former President Barack Obama -- during previous Middle East fighting. The conflict amounted to the first major foreign crisis of a presidency focused overwhelmingly on domestic matters. It marked a critical juncture for American Democrats, whose calls on Biden to deliver a more forceful response to Israel's actions were mostly rebuffed. For the President, it created an inflection point in an up-and-down relationship with Netanyahu that goes back more than 40 years. Yet for all its significance, officials signaled the burst of fighting was unlikely to prompt Biden to realign his priorities back to the Middle East, a region of murky and intractable battles he'd sought to avoid as president.  ""We think there are some opportunities here, but we have to be very realistic,"" said Brett McGurk, the Middle East and North Africa coordinator on Biden's National Security Council. ""We do not want to set unachievable objectives and waste time pursuing those."" Biden prepares to set his sights overseas  The bloody conflict, furious behind-the-scenes diplomacy and carefully calibrated public response acted as a precursor to an intensive stretch for Biden on the world stage. He is expected to nominate his first slate of high-profile ambassadors at some point in the coming days, according to people familiar with the matter. The announcement, which is likely to include an ambassador nominee to Israel, had been delayed as the White House compiles a diverse list of names, mindful the first batch of ambassadorships ""could not be dominated by a group of rich, white donors,"" an official familiar with the search told CNN. He will depart in early June for his first trip abroad, seeking to reassure world leaders at the Group of 7 and NATO of his commitment to traditional American alliances. He is expected to meet afterward with Vladimir Putin, perhaps in Switzerland, for a high-stakes summit he has made clear to officials will look very different from the last time the Russian President met his American counterpart. And in the coming months, Biden will begin a robust vaccine sharing program with other countries meant to bolster global inoculations while also asserting American leadership in an area of diplomacy that so far has been dominated by Russia and China. That the kickoff to Biden's most concerted stretch of diplomacy was an unplanned crisis in the Middle East made for an ironic twist. Biden has sought to realign American interests elsewhere, including China. Some of his aides viewed the fighting between Israel and Hamas as a distraction. As the tenuous ceasefire took effect, Biden immediately turned his attention to Asia on Friday, meeting with the South Korean president at the White House. Biden confident in his foreign policy plans  Until now, Biden has been focused almost exclusively on navigating the country from the ongoing coronavirus pandemic -- an effort he's framed in global terms. ""We've gotten to a point where I think our economic competence has a gigantic impact on our international influence and capacity,"" he told New York Times columnist David Brooks this week. The 11-day crisis between Israel and Hamas isn't likely to change Biden's outlook, though his top diplomat will travel to the region next week and Biden has pledged to support international humanitarian efforts in Gaza.  ""The priority is still domestic. He is not looking for heavy foreign policy entanglements,"" Richard Haas, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, told CNN. ""I think there's no strong case to get seriously involved in the Israeli-Palestinian issue because the pieces are not present, not even close to being present, that any diplomat -- no matter how talented -- could realize progress."" Still, though the Middle East conflict was unwelcome, Biden approached it with a level of confidence developed over a career spent cultivating world leaders and honing his policy instincts. His initial conversations with Netanyahu were friendly, people familiar with the matter said, and the White House did not publicly mention the word ""ceasefire"" until this week. The destruction last Saturday of a Gaza high-rise housing offices for the Associated Press and other media outlets caused heightened alarm in the White House, officials said, and prompted another phone call between Biden and Netanyahu. American officials made clear to the Israelis that the US did not plan to publicly defend the country's decision to level the building, even after Israel shared intelligence it said proved Hamas was operating there, saying instead it was up to them to justify the strike.  Through it all, however, Biden showed little willingness to reevaluate his approach, even when questioned harshly by members of his own party. While his tone with Netanyahu gradually sharpened behind-the-scenes, he made no public statements about the situation for days until the ceasefire was announced on Thursday. Even then, Biden spoke for only three minutes. ""Bibi, the prime minister, knows my views,"" Biden said at a news conference on Friday. ""The commitment that was given was immediately kept from the very beginning. I told him what our objective was, that there needed to be a ceasefire, and he in fact kept his commitment in the time frame in which he said he would do it."" Several administration officials privately dismissed vocal pushes by progressives to get Biden to come down harder on Netanyahu, arguing it would alienate him and possibly extend the violence. Officials say Biden has little patience when challenged on foreign matters, an area that aides describe as his ""first love."" He often expounds at length on his views of the world and its leaders -- including the autocrats in charge of Russia and China -- but has sometimes shut down conversations if he finds those views challenged. Waging a private pressure campaign rather than issuing public statements left Biden feeling vindicated in his strategy after a ceasefire was announced, according to people who spoke with him. Biden felt if he ""hugged Israel close,"" while closely engaging with them behind the scenes, he would be able to ""end the violence faster,"" the person who spoke with the President told CNN.  The tactic partly derived from the experience of the Obama administration, when public pressure on Israel failed to prevent a prolonged war in Gaza in 2014, according to another person familiar with White House thinking. ""This war had every indication that this was going to go on for many weeks, if not months, and it was a patient, quiet diplomacy led by the President that got it into place to end after 11 days,"" said McGurk in an interview on CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper."" ""Now we have to work just as hard in the aftermath to make sure we reduce the risks of another event triggering such a conflict."" How much Biden actually influenced the situation on the ground is an open question. American officials -- including McGurk and Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan -- played critical roles as go-betweens for the various parties, including Egypt. But US assessments of the conflict suggested Israel was close to running out of fixed targets in Gaza by Wednesday, according to an official closely tracking the situation on the ground. And because the US does not formally engage with Hamas, which it labels a terror group, Biden relied on leaders like Egypt's Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi to wield their influence. ""I think this ceasefire largely came about, and I don't mean this to be critical, less because of what the United States said or did, but really because both Hamas and the government of Israel concluded that continued warfare wasn't serving their interests,"" Haas said. Ambassador process causes consternation  As the cross-border conflict intensified between Israel and Gaza, the still-vacant post of the US ambassador to Jerusalem became the subject of sharp criticism, with pointed questions about why the position had yet to be filled. The President is poised to announce a wave of roughly 10 high-profile ambassador nominations soon, a senior administration official said, including Israel.  The timing has put the Biden administration behind the pace set by his most recent predecessors and has led to frustration among some State Department officials and top donors, who have been in something of a holding pattern for months. The President has signed off on several key positions, but White House officials have delayed any announcements until a full list is complete. At least two high-level contenders were taken out of consideration in recent weeks, a person familiar with the matter said, after the vetting of finances and statements on social media emerged as a potential challenge during the confirmation process. Above all, a senior administration official said, one of the biggest reasons for the delay is that the selection has become something of a game of musical chairs. Several donors or friends of Biden expressed interest in one position, but were offered second choices, given the overall list of nominees. ""Diversity among ambassadors is just as important to the President as diversity in his Cabinet,"" a White House official said, speaking on the cond","{'neg': 0.415, 'neu': 0.585, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.7964}",67,142.0,0.07344444444444445,0.8945555555555555,0.032,-0.23192857142857143,0.087,0.836,0.076,-0.9805,-15.539214285714285,-8.20091428571428,213.0,-0.038501945003353424
Kidney from Jew killed in mob violence goes to Arab woman,2021-05-22,"Randa Aweis, 58, waited nine years for the organ donation that would change her life. An Arab Christian, born in the Old City of Jerusalem, she was relying on regular dialysis sessions as her kidneys failed. Then the call came: A donor kidney was available. Aweis had surgery Monday at Jerusalem's famed Hadassah University Hospital Ein Kerem.  When she went under the anaesthetic, she did not know who the donor was. Only afterwards did she find out that it was Yigal Yehoshua, a Jewish Israeli man who died in the wave of violence between Jews and Arabs in the Israeli town of Lod.  ""I said, 'What? How can that be? How did I get the kidney?'"" Aweis told CNN from her hospital bed. ""They told me I got a present. It is a kidney that was a present from Yigal. I said, 'Good.' I was moved. In a war a Jew gave a kidney to an Arab."" Yehoshua, 56, was critically injured on May 11 after being attacked by a group of young Arab Israeli men in Lod. He fought for his life for nearly a week before dying on Monday and being buried on Tuesday. For many here, the explosion of violence between Israeli Arabs and Jews who had lived in mixed communities for years was one of the most shocking results of the conflict between Israel and Palestinian militants.  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the attacks as ""unacceptable,"" saying in a statement: ""Nothing justifies the lynching of Jews by Arabs and nothing justifies the lynching of Arabs by Jews.""  Yehoshua's brother Efi, spoke at his funeral, saying his brother ""believed in coexistence."" ""You said to me it would not happen. You believed if you put your head out everything will be fine: 'They know Yigal.' And the worst thing happened,"" he said. He kept vigil at his brother's hospital bed for six days.  ""I waited for you to wake up. Day after day. A finger, an arm, a leg, a word. You never did anything wrong. You paid with your life. You have given life to others. You will be blessed,"" Efi Yehoshua said. Calls for peaceful coexistence Aweis, who received Yehoshua's kidney, now wrestles with the same questions Efi faced at the funeral. ""The poor man, what did he do?"" she asked from her hospital bed after surgery. ""What did he do to them? Why did they kill him? What is his wife going to do with his kids?""  Aweis said she grew up in a mixed Arab-Jewish community in Jerusalem herself. ""There was no racism. Not from the Jews, not from the Arabs,"" she said. ""I grew up with the Jews. Our kids grew up with Jews."" Her surgeon, Dr. Abed Khalaeileh -- a Palestinian born in Jerusalem -- said he and his colleagues simply treat everyone as human beings. ""We deal with everyone equally. There is no black and no white. Everyone is equal in the medical attention they receive,"" he said.  In his line of work, as head of Hadassah Ein Kerem's transplant unit, the sorrow of death brings new life ""The world of transplant is the world of humanity and it is important to remember this,"" he said. ""People are born anew."" He is inspired, he said, by the spirit of Yehoshua's family.  ""I turn to the family and feel part of their pain and say thank you for everything you have done. It cannot be taken for granted that a person will stand up and donate an organ during this time,"" he said.  Aweis hopes to be able to try and help ease some of the family's pain. She said she has already spoken to Yehoshua's family, but that one of her first visits when she gets out of the hospital will be to Yehoshua's family to thank them and give them strength. ""I will tell Yigal's family thank you. They should not feel any more suffering. Yigal is going to heaven where it is better than here,"" she said.   And she has a message for the Jews and Arabs of the region: ""We should live together. We should have peace. We should be happy.""","{'neg': 0.489, 'neu': 0.511, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.8625}",59,143.0,0.177,0.823,0.0,-0.7003,0.079,0.86,0.061,-0.8057,-41.3177,-48.18461428571428,249.0,-0.1935125071715433

Jared Kushner's Middle East fantasy explodes,2021-05-20,"President Donald Trump's shadow secretary of state, Jared Kushner, had a sole diplomatic achievement, grandiosely termed the ""Abraham Accords."" The accords would purportedly start the process of bringing peace to the Middle East by normalizing relations between Israel and a number of Arab states.   Two months ago, Kushner took to the pages of The Wall Street Journal to congratulate himself on the supposed ""geopolitical earthquake"" that was engendered by the Abraham Accords, while dismissing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as ""nothing more than a real-estate dispute.""    But now a genuine geopolitical earthquake precipitated by this mere real estate dispute has erupted into a shooting war between Israel and the Palestinians, a conflict that is in its eleventh day.   Kushner's plan was predicated on a fantasy; that peace would be achieved by negotiating without the Palestinians and instead by creating warmer relations between the Arab states and Israel. In Kushner's analysis, the road to peace in Israel ran not through Gaza, Jerusalem and the West Bank, but through the United Arab Emirates.   Of course, there was nothing wrong with trying to foster better relations between the Arab states and Israel, relations that were already warming because of their common enemy: Iran.   But the fantasy elements in Kushner's plan were that the Palestinians would essentially forget about their legitimate grievances because of large scale investments that Kushner would help secure for the Gaza and the West Bank, while the Arab states would put pressure on the Palestinians to make a lasting peace with Israel. The Arab nations would then, in turn, have more leverage on Israel to moderate its stance on the Palestinian issue.    But none of this happened.   Kushner's plan to corral $50 billion for Palestinian projects sputtered because the Palestinians boycotted an investment conference that he hosted in Bahrain in 2019. At the conference, President Donald Trump's Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin claimed that investments in the West Bank and Gaza were ""going to be like a hot I.P.O.,"" evoking the Wall Street phrase for an initial public offering of stock.    Instead of a hot I.P.O., there is now a hot war.    As the conflict has raged between Israel and the Palestinians, the Saudi government, which was not a party to the Abraham Accords, issued a statement ""categorically"" rejecting ""Israeli violations against Palestinians,"" while Morocco, which was a party to the accords, said it was watching the war ""with deep concern.""     Turns out that the Arabs actually do care about this ""real estate dispute,"" not least because the third holiest site in Islam is the Al-Aqsa Mosque in East Jerusalem, the site from which Muslims believe that the Prophet Muhammad ascended into heaven.   The match that first lit the fire of the current conflict was an ill-judged Israeli police raid on April 11 at the Al-Aqsa Mosque on the first day of Ramadan. The police operation was mounted to turn off loudspeakers broadcasting prayers so that the president of Israel could deliver a speech nearby without any possible interruption, according to The New York Times.   Almost a month later, Israel police raided the mosque again using stun grenades, charging that Palestinian protesters had provoked the move by throwing stones.   Another accelerant for the conflict was the possible eviction of several Palestinian families in East Jerusalem, which they saw as part of a far larger pattern of the persistent encroachment on Palestinian lands by the Israelis, a process that, in fairness, began long before the Trump administration.  But the eviction of Palestinians from their land by the Israelis accelerated during Trump's tenure, according to analyses by The Associated Press. David Friedman, Trump's ambassador to Israel, said that he did not believe Israeli settlement activity was illegal and that the Trump administration could support Israel even if it annexed parts of the West Bank.    Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu who has long pushed for more Israeli settlements, was so close to Kushner's family that he had once slept in Kushner's childhood bedroom in New Jersey, while Jared moved to the basement for the night.    Acting as if it were an arm of the Netanyahu government, the Trump administration implemented punitive measures against the Palestinians, such as withdrawing US support for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which educates hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinian children in countries around the Middle East.  The Trump administration also closed the Palestinian mission in Washington, DC, and moved the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which previous US administrations had avoided doing as it was deemed provocative to the Palestinians who lay claim to parts of East Jerusalem.      In short, the Trump administration went out of its way to sabotage any chance of a real peace settlement in Israel, which any fair-minded observer knows must be some kind of two-state solution.   The Biden team has inherited this Trumpian mess. President Joe Biden had a reportedly stern discussion with Netanyahu on Wednesday, saying ""that he expected a significant de-escalation today on the path to a ceasefire."" This is a good start -- the era of giving a blank check to Netanyahu must end. And on Thursday evening President Biden announced that a cease-fire would go into effect between the Israelis and Hamas.  Kushner has famously said that he had read 25 books about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which he seemed to think equipped him to solve the issue.  I wonder if in the course of doing his homework Kushner ever had a chance to watch ""The Gatekeepers."" According to six former leaders of Shin Bet, Israel's internal security service, who spoke frankly in this remarkable 2013 documentary, Israel wins pretty much every battle, but it will still lose the overall war if it doesn't find a way to peace through a two-state solution.

Israeli forces in violent confrontations with Palestinians outside Jerusalem's Al Aqsa mosque after Gaza ceasefire,2021-05-21,"Israeli security forces used stun grenades and rubber bullets against Palestinians outside the Al Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, where thousands of worshipers had been attending Friday prayers, puncturing a half-day of calm brought on by a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. A CNN journalist at the mosque compound said dozens of Israeli officers hit journalists with batons and tried to point rifles at them, calling them ""liars"" when they showed them their press cards. The officers moved on to the compound as thousands of worshipers chanted in solidarity with Gaza and with Palestinian residents of the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah, where some Palestinian families are facing eviction. The Palestinian Authority strongly condemned what it is describing as an ""incursion"" by Israeli police at the mosque compound, the official Palestinian News Agency, WAFA, reported Friday. ""The Israeli government, by continuing its policy of provocation, attacks and incursions, is challenging international efforts that have been made to reach a calm and stop the violence and escalation in Jerusalem and the occupied Palestinian territories, and to stop the aggression on Gaza,"" the  statement said. An Israeli police spokesperson said the officers were responding to a riot by hundreds of young Palestinians that included the throwing of stones at police forces. CNN witnessed people, including screaming children, fleeing the scene to the sound of stun grenade blasts. The Palestinian Red Crescent said it treated 20 injuries following clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police at the compound. Two people were taken to hospital, while the rest were treated in the field, the aid group said. The mosque and evictions have been flashpoints in the recent conflict between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which according to the Hamas-run health ministry, left 248 Palestinians in Gaza dead, including 66 children, and 12 in Israel -- including two children -- who died from militant fire, according to the IDF and Israel's emergency service. A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas at 2 a.m. and the streets of Jerusalem and Gaza had been peaceful, albeit lively, for hours, with Palestinians and Arab citizens of Israel celebrating the end of the worst conflict in years. UN human rights experts called on all parties in the conflict to respect the ceasefire on Friday, while also calling for an investigation by the International Criminal Court (ICC) ""into the attacks on civilian populations and other gross violations of human rights,"" according to a statement. They pointed to the ""forced evictions of Palestinian families living in Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan in Occupied East Jerusalem as the spark that set off a full-blown war."" The experts urged the ICC to investigate acts by all parties which violate the Rome Statute, especially war crimes, including targeting of civilians.   Crowds in Gaza waved Palestinian flags and shot fireworks, also celebrating Eid al Fitr belatedly as the conflict with Israel forced Muslims to delay their celebrations marking the end of Ramadan. Hundreds of people drove around historically Arab east Jerusalem honking their car horns in celebration, and video footage from social media and television showed similar scenes in other cities, including Umm al-Fahm in Israel and Ramallah in the West Bank.  The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) carried out a massive aerial bombardment of Gaza, while Hamas fired thousands of rockets into Israel during the 11 days of violence. Hamas' infrastructure was pummelled by the Israeli Air Force, which took out huge sections of its tunnel network and buildings that the IDF said housed Hamas commanders or were used to store weapons. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed the Israeli operation in Gaza was a success, saying in a televised address Friday that ""Hamas can't hide any more."" ""We hit Hamas more than their leaders ever could have imagined. We changed the rules of the game with this operation,"" Netanyahu said. The political leader of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, also sought to declare victory in a speech on Friday afternoon, saying ""the resistance is much stronger today."" ""Gaza victory is for the sake of Jerusalem, Al-Aqsa Mosque, Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood, and the West Bank,"" Haniya said. ""All the blood that was shed in this battle and the battles that preceded it is the resistance on the road to Jerusalem."" Haniyeh also thanked Iran, ""which has given money and weapons to the valiant resistance,"" and Egypt, which he said was following the battle closely and had exercised its ""historical role to curb the aggression."" Rebuilding Gaza US President Joe Biden welcomed the truce overnight after facing a barrage of criticism from within his own party that he was not doing enough to persuade Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to end the country's airstrikes in Gaza. ""I believe the Palestinians and Israelis equally deserve to live safely and securely, and enjoy equal measures of freedom, prosperity and democracy,"" Biden said. ""My administration will continue our quiet, relentless diplomacy toward that end."" Biden, who has had a working relationship with Netanyahu over four decades, sought to deflect criticism that his administration had not been active enough in what has become the President's biggest foreign policy challenge since he took office in January. ""We've held intensive high-level discussions, hour-by-hour, literally, (with) Egypt, the Palestinian Authority and other Middle Eastern countries with an aim of avoiding the sort of prolonged conflict we've seen in previous years when the hostilities have broken out,"" Biden said in evening remarks on Thursday. Now the US' attention will turn to the enormous task of rebuilding Gaza, where many civilians, their homes and services were caught up in strikes aimed at Hamas. In northern Gaza's Beit Hanoun, residents from a blown-out building were seen sorting through the rubble, using heavy machinery to clear the worst of the debris, as a boy stood amid the destruction, his hands covering his face in disbelief. Personal items, including a wheelchair and a child's bed, poked through the mounds of concrete. Biden said he was ready ""to work with the United Nations and other international stakeholders to provide rapid humanitarian assistance and to marshal international support for the people of Gaza and the Gaza reconstruction efforts."" ""We will do this in full partnership with the Palestinian Authority, not Hamas, the Authority, in a manner that does not permit Hamas to simply restock its military arsenal,"" Biden said. But the US President knows the Palestinian Authority holds limited sway in Gaza, and signs are the latest round of fighting has weakened its position outside the coastal enclave as well. Israeli Foreign Minister, Gabi Ashkenazi, spoke with his Egyptian counterpart, Sameh Shoukry, on Friday night, to discuss measures to rebuild areas that had been destroyed in Gaza. According to a statement released by Egypt's Foreign Ministery, the two ""discussed measures to facilitate the reconstruction of Gaza"" and stressed the importance of working in coordination between the two countries, the Palestinian Authority and international partners."" A video filmed overnight at the Al Aqsa mosque showed crowds chanting ""the people demand the overthrow of the president,"" in reference to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. It's just one of the indications that Hamas -- a rival of the Fatah movement led by Abbas -- appears to have gained popular support during the conflict with Israel. The Palestinian political situation is in itself complicated. Abbas in April delayed the first parliamentary elections in 15 years, extending a long-running rivalry where his Fatah movement governs the West Bank, while Gaza is run by Hamas. The Islamic Jihad militant group is also active in Gaza.","{'neg': 0.33, 'neu': 0.67, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.7506}",43,146.0,0.04625,0.8694999999999999,0.08399999999999999,0.11376666666666668,0.086,0.848,0.066,-0.9835,4.891966666666668,-36.47011428571428,204.0,-0.17877507002801118
"Biden, staring down first Mideast crisis, touts ceasefire",2021-05-20,"President Joe Biden -- having weathered the first major foreign crisis of his presidency that tested the bounds of his decades-long friendship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu -- touted Thursday a ceasefire deal that appears to end the bloody 11-day conflict between Israel and Hamas. In hastily arranged remarks from the White House delivered one hour before the truce was due to take effect, Biden credited his administration's own ""quiet and relentless diplomacy,"" along with efforts by Egypt, in arriving at the agreement. ""We've held intensive high-level discussions, hour-by-hour, literally, (with) Egypt, the Palestinian Authority and other Middle Eastern countries with an aim of avoiding the sort of prolonged conflict we've seen in previous years when the hostilities have broken out,"" Biden said. The conflict and subsequent ceasefire provided an early glimpse at how Biden -- a president more versed in US foreign policy than any of his recent predecessors -- will handle rapidly evolving foreign crises. His approach emphasized private diplomacy over proactive public statements, even as he came under sustained criticism from fellow Democrats for not speaking out more forcefully. Afterward, people who spoke to the President said Biden voiced confidence his behind-the-scenes approach with Netanyahu was successful, and said he believed it had played a critical role in ending the violence faster.  Biden did not become more combative with his Israeli counterpart until recent days, when he bluntly told Netanyahu the violence needed to stop. But he did so privately, and hardly addressed the situation in person during the 11 days it raged on.  Biden felt if he ""hugged Israel close,"" while closely engaging with them behind the scenes, he would be able to ""end the violence faster,"" the person who spoke with Biden told CNN.  Moments before emerging in the Cross Hall, Biden spoke again to Netanyahu, the second time they'd conferred Thursday and the sixth phone call between the two men in the past 11 days. In a conversation on Wednesday, Biden had delivered a blunt message of impatience as Israel's bombing campaign continued in Gaza. Biden, who's been viewed as a firm supporter of Israel for his entire political career, had come under pressure from members of his own party to speak out more forcefully against Israel's actions over the past week. He chose instead to remain mostly silent on the matter in public. His remarks Thursday were his first public statement about the crisis in eight days. The violence had exposed a rapidly shifting dynamic in the Democratic Party, where progressive members feel free to openly criticize Israel and even those who have typically supported Israel's right to defend itself called for a ceasefire. In remarks that were designed to strike a careful balance, Biden reiterated Israel's right to defend itself from Hamas rocket attacks, and committed to helping the country replenish its Iron Dome missile defense system. But he also made a nod to improving conditions for the Palestinians without specifically criticizing Israel's actions in the lead-up to the fighting, including the planned eviction of Palestinian families from a neighborhood in East Jerusalem. ""I believe the Palestinians and Israelis equally deserve to live safely and securely, and enjoy equal measures of freedom, prosperity and democracy,"" Biden said. ""My administration will continue our quiet, relentless diplomacy toward that end."" Israel and Hamas independently announced Thursday they had agreed to an Egyptian initiative for a mutual ceasefire. The Israelis said the deal would go into effect at a time to be agreed upon later, but a senior Hamas leader told CNN it would go into effect at 7 p.m. ET Thursday. The news came after Biden placed a telephone call to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi on Thursday as part of his effort to lean on regional leaders to help broker an end to the violence. It was his first conversation with el-Sisi since becoming president. The US does not engage formally with Hamas, which it has labeled a terror organization, and must rely on countries like Egypt and Qatar to wield influence on the group.  Entering office, Biden had not prioritized the Middle East in his list of foreign policies and has yet to name an ambassador to Israel or a special envoy. The conflict posed an early test for the Biden-Netanyahu relationship, which has developed over four decades of intersecting political careers.  Biden had become increasingly impatient with Netanyahu, and adopted a more ""direct, frank and candid"" tone during a Wednesday call than during any of their previous conversations since the President took office, according to a senior administration official.  The White House used progressively more urgent language to describe each conversation between the two leaders, even as officials described a diplomatic effort focused more on behind-the-scenes pressure than public cajoling. In their conversation early Wednesday, Biden wanted Netanyahu to take his stern warning seriously, given he had quietly waited days to deliver it, several people familiar with the matter said. Part of Biden's calculus in remaining quiet publicly had been a worry Netanyahu would ignore public demands to de-escalate. After the White House said Biden told Netanyahu ""he expected a significant de-escalation today on the path to a ceasefire,"" the Prime Minister emerged from a visit to an Israel Defense Forces command center to proclaim he was ""determined to continue this operation."" And on Wednesday and Thursday, dozens of Israeli warplanes launched a series of airstrikes on several Hamas targets. Biden made clear to Netanyahu on the call that international pressure would increase if the military campaign continued. And he's informed Netanyahu of the new politics in the Democratic Party surrounding Israel.  But he wasn't left with any assurances from the Israeli Prime Minister that his entreaties would be heeded. Netanyahu offered Biden no specific pledge to wind down the violence.  A day later, however, Netanyahu's office said his security cabinet had accepted Egypt's ceasefire proposal, though only after what the country's defense minister described as military achievements ""unprecedented in their power, precision and strategic significance, in the struggle against terror organizations in the Gaza strip."" This story has been updated with additional developments on Thursday.","{'neg': 0.464, 'neu': 0.536, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.6369}",38,147.0,0.13438461538461538,0.7893076923076923,0.07630769230769231,-0.16905,0.107,0.777,0.116,0.3401,-6.423900000000001,-27.354799999999997,175.0,-0.15631314285714284
Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas agree to a ceasefire,2021-05-20,"Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas have agreed to a ceasefire, after more than a week of conflict left hundreds dead, most of them Palestinians. The truce signals an end to the immediate bloodshed, but will likely leave both sides further apart than ever.  Over 11 days, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) carried out a devastating aerial bombardment of Gaza, while the Palestinian militant group Hamas fired thousands of rockets into Israel, in violence that has underscored how elusive a longer term peace agreement has become. Israeli airstrikes killed 232 Palestinians, including 65 children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry there. At least 12 people in Israel, including two children, have been killed by Palestinian militant fire from Gaza, according to the IDF and Israel's emergency service. A senior Hamas leader told CNN that the truce, under terms brokered by Egypt, would commence at 2am local time on Friday.  ""The Security Cabinet convened this evening. And accepted unanimously the recommendation of all security elements -- the Chief of Staff, the head of the Shin Bet, the Head of the Mossad, and the head of the National Security Council -- to accept the Egyptian initiative for a mutual unconditional ceasefire that will go into effect at an hour to be agreed upon later,"" read the statement from the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  Celebrations of the truce could be seen in Gaza and Tel Aviv following the announcement. In the early hours of Friday morning, a CNN reporter could see cars honking in the streets in joy, while a voice broadcast from a nearby mosque praised God. In Tel Aviv, the news drew a mix of reactions, from relief to skepticism.  ""I think its good the ceasefire is good for humanitarian reasons to let civilians relax a little bit on both sides. I am skeptical though that it will really be kept for a while,"" said 22-year-old Tzvika Geft to Reuters.  ""I don't think Israel has achieved much. I mean there no ... no agreements about the future, nothing. But I guess good to have a bit of break."" Eleven days of war News of the ceasefire came with a flurry of parting shots; just moments after the ceasefire was announced and before it formally began, sirens warning of rocket attacks sounded yet again in towns and villages in Israel close to Gaza. Since the conflict began, Palestinian militants have fired more than 4,000 rockets into Israel, according to the IDF. Many have been intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome defense system. The longest lull in rocket fire from Gaza -- of more than eight hours -- took place overnight into Thursday, while Israeli military action continued. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) meanwhile have carried out a devastating aerial bombardment of Gaza, targeting Hamas' vast tunnel network and other infrastructure. Some 72,000 Gazans have been displaced, UNICEF said Wednesday.The Israeli Prime Minister's Office made clear Thursday that its military will be instructed to re-start its campaign against militant groups in Gaza if they are deemed to be failing to keep their side of the agreement. ""The political leadership emphasizes that the reality on the ground will determine any decision to resume the military campaign,"" the statement said. The truce follows a whirlwind of diplomatic attempts to push for a ceasefire. US President Joe Biden and his administration had dialed up messaging on Israel over the past few days, including in Biden's fourth call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday. In hastily arranged remarks from the White House delivered one hour before the truce was due to take effect, the US President credited his administration's own ""quiet and relentless diplomacy,"" along with efforts by Egypt, in arriving at the agreement. ""We've held intensive high-level discussions, hour-by-hour, literally, (with) Egypt, the Palestinian Authority and other Middle Eastern countries with an aim of avoiding the sort of prolonged conflict we've seen in previous years when the hostilities have broken out,"" Biden said. Biden did not become more combative with his Israeli counterpart until recent days, when he bluntly told Netanyahu the violence needed to stop. But he did so privately, and hardly addressed the situation in person during the 11 days it raged on.  UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres also welcomed the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, but said more remained to be done. Guterres told reporters he wants a return to negotiations between Israel and Palestinians, and called for robust humanitarian aid distribution to residents in Gaza. ""I stress that Israeli and Palestinian leaders have a responsibility beyond the restoration of calm to start a serious dialogue to address the root causes of the conflict. Gaza is an integral part of the future Palestinian state and no effort should be spared to bring about real national reconciliation that ends the division,"" he said. The Secretary General had earlier called for an immediate ceasefire in a impassioned speech in New York.  ""If there is a hell on Earth, it is the lives of children in Gaza today,"" he said, according to a transcript of his remarks.  Hostilities between Israel and Hamas erupted after weeks of tension in Jerusalem, where a group of Palestinian families faced eviction from their homes in East Jerusalem in favor of Jewish nationalists.  In addition, during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, there were a series of incidents which Palestinians saw as highly provocative, including the closing of a popular meeting place near the Old City, and the entrance of Israeli police into the Al Aqsa mosque on a number of occasions. There were regular clashes in and around the mosque compound during which police fired stun grenades and rubber coated bullets while Palestinians threw stones. Hundreds of Palestinians and some Israeli police officers were injured in the unrest.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.762, 'pos': 0.238, 'compound': 0.3612}",39,148.0,0.077,0.8713333333333333,0.051666666666666666,0.059750000000000025,0.134,0.773,0.093,-0.9952,2.330250000000001,16.293150000000008,155.0,0.1051170967741936
New hopes of ceasefire deal as calls to end Israel-Palestinian conflict intensify,2021-05-20,"Cautious optimism was growing that a ceasefire between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza could soon put a halt to days of bloody conflict, but fresh airstrikes and rocket fire Thursday signaled that the violence wasn't over yet. Hamas officials told CNN Wednesday that a halt to the clashes could be ""imminent, possibly within 24 hours,"" as the White House and Europe dialed up pressure on both sides to end the fighting. Israel, however, has not commented on the possibility of a ceasefire deal. US President Joe Biden has ramped up pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to end the fighting with Hamas, giving the Israeli leader a deadline in a call on Wednesday for ""a significant de-escalation today on the path to a ceasefire."" European leaders were also stepping up their push to put an end to the turmoil.  German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas flew to Israel on Thursday for talks with senior Israeli and Palestinian officials, backing international efforts for a ceasefire and calling for violence to end as soon as possible, though his remarks that ""Israel must defend itself against Hamas' rocket terror"" prompted a rebuke from the Palestinian militant group.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel made similar remarks in a phone call with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, with both supporting a ceasefire, according to her spokesman Steffen Seibert. ""The Chancellor emphasized Israel's right of self-defense against the missile strikes form the Gaza-Strip,"" he said.  France has drafted a UN Security Council resolution seeking a cessation in hostilities and humanitarian access to Gaza, but it has been blocked by the United States, which says it could undermine the Biden administration's efforts to de-escalate.  The diplomatic push comes amid mounting concerns over the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza, where 230 people, including more than 60 children, have been killed in Israeli airstrikes, according to the Hamas-run health ministry there. At least 12 people in Israel, including two children, have been killed by Palestinian militant fire from Gaza during the current round of violence. The aid group Doctors Without Borders (MSF) says its staff were being denied permission to cross from Israel into Gaza. Ely Sok, MSF Head of Mission in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, said that ""humanitarian needs are mounting, with more than 1,400 people injured and tens of thousands of people displaced."" Sok added in a statement that the health system in Gaza was ""out of key materials to treat the injured such as blood bags."" ""We still don't know when our team will be able to cross into Gaza to join our colleagues who are already there. The crossing points need to be reopened immediately and safe passage must be facilitated for humanitarian staff and supplies to avert a greater catastrophe,"" he said. Israel stopped shipments entering Gaza after the Erez crossing was attacked with mortars on Tuesday. Those attacks were claimed by the military wing of Islamic Jihad. 'Even wars have rules,' says UN chief UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres added his voice to calls for an immediate ceasefire in a impassioned speech in New York. ""If there is a hell on Earth, it is the lives of children in Gaza today,"" he said, according to a transcript of his remarks.  He said he intended to launch a full humanitarian appeal for funding for the people of Gaza and was working to free up emergency funds. ""Access for humanitarian goods is paramount. Attacks by militant groups on areas surrounding crossing points are unacceptable,"" he said. ""Even wars have rules. First and foremost, civilians must be protected.""  Israel on Thursday saw its longest lull in rocket fire from Gaza -- more than eight hours -- since the conflict broke out on May 10.  But by Thursday morning, sirens were sounding again in southern Israel, warning of an incoming barrage of rockets. Meanwhile, Israeli warplanes continued to pound targets in Gaza overnight. Speaking after visiting an Israel Defense Forces command center on Wednesday, Netanyahu said he was ""determined to continue this operation until its objective is achieved: to restore quiet and security to you, citizens of Israel."" Netanyahu has not clarified whether Israel would support a ceasefire, nor has he commented on Biden's calls for one. In a tweet after his conversation with Biden on Wednesday, he said: ""I especially appreciate the support of our friend @POTUS Joe Biden, for the State of Israel's right to self-defense."" Biden has grown increasingly eager for the fighting to end, according to officials, but has been wary of publicly applying pressure on Netanyahu, believing the tactic would backfire. But Netanyahu's comments that he plans to continue the operation in Gaza until Hamas targets are taken out have strained US patience, according to officials. Biden made clear to Netanyahu on the call that international pressure would increase if the military campaign continues. Still, Hamas officials tell CNN that ceasefire agreement will most likely be reached within days. A Hamas leader on Wednesday said there was a ""positive atmosphere"" around the talks to reach an agreement with Israel, ""thanks to the support of our Egyptian and Qatari brothers,"" who proposed different solutions.  Hamas said Israeli warplanes had carried out 1,810 airstrikes on Gaza as of Wednesday, inflicting more than $323 million of damage and destroying at least 1,335 homes. Some 66 schools and primary healthcare clinics have also been damaged; 184 residential towers and office buildings have been razed to the ground; and 33 media institutions have been totally destroyed, according to the Hamas-run ministry of information Some 72,000 Palestinians in Gaza have also been displaced by Israeli strikes as a result of the UNICEF said Wednesday in a statement, half of which are children. Of those 72,000, UNICEF said, more than 52,000 are ""reportedly now sheltering in 48 schools across the Gaza Strip."" According to the UN Children's Emergency Fund, one in three children in Gaza was in need of psychological support prior to the recent escalation in the conflict. The number of children with symptoms of psychosocial distress is now expected to have increased.  The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) has launched a $38 million ""flash appeal"" in aid of what they have described as ""the most urgent humanitarian needs"" in Gaza and the West Bank.","{'neg': 0.152, 'neu': 0.662, 'pos': 0.185, 'compound': 0.128}",41,149.0,0.08066666666666666,0.7983333333333333,0.12133333333333333,0.07705,0.147,0.748,0.106,-0.9962,3.1590499999999997,19.45220000000001,192.0,0.10131354166666671
The Trump-Netanyahu bromance deepened American Jews' divide on Israel,2021-05-18,"A few weeks shy of 54 years ago, as Arab armies massed on its borders vowing extermination, Israel launched the preemptive attack that set off the Six-Day War. In that sudden transformation from looming genocide to military triumph, American Jews rallied behind the Jewish state as never before -- with unprecedented cash donations and public demonstrations.  The spectacle of the Diaspora's largest Jewish community mobilizing around the Jewish nation set a model to be repeated during the 1973 war and the suicide bombings of the second intifada in the early 2000s. When Israel was in trouble, American Jews spoke in a single voice. Measured by that benchmark, the response of American Jewry to Israel during its current battle with Hamas represents a striking departure. Two of the Jewish people serving in the US Senate -- Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Jon Ossoff of Georgia -- have taken leading roles in calling for evenhanded American policy on the Israeli-Palestinian issue and for an immediate cease fire, respectively. And the liberal Jewish lobbying group, J Street, has provided important political support for politicians, whether Jewish or not, to criticize Israel's relentless bombing of Gaza in response to Hamas' rocket attacks on Israel without the risk of being smeared as being anti-Israel or even anti-Semitic. At the level of daily Jewish life in America, experts sense a distinctly muted mood. ""There's a fairly dramatic lack of urgency,"" Dr. Kenneth Wald, an emeritus professor of American Jewish culture and society at the University of Florida in Gainesville, told me in a telephone interview. ""I've been on our local Jewish Federation board for 20-something years and nobody has jumped up and said, 'We've got to run an emergency campaign for Israel.' It struck me that there's an absence of calls for mobilization. And in shul last Shabbat, our rabbi, who does not normally talk about current affairs, gave a very nuanced talk -- the need for us to stop thinking about the other as the other."" It would be a historical mistake to view the American Jewish stance during this war as an anomaly. Despite the surges of mass grassroots advocacy for Israel during times of existential threat, the seeds of dissent took root during what might be described as volitional conflicts like the invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and the first intifada in the late 1980s. Americans for Peace Now, one of the earliest hubs of American Jewish dissidence on Israeli militarism, took both its name and inspiration from the Israeli organization that led the outcry there against the Lebanon war. Then, the revelation of secret peace talks between Israeli and Palestinian delegations in the Oslo process of the early 1990s gave American Jews permission to voice support for a two-state solution without being disparaged as disloyal. And, as early as 2001, the scholar Steven T. Rosenthal was warning of the ""waning of the American Jewish love affair with Israel.""  And this trend is started to reflect in the polling of American Jews. A newly-released survey of American Jewry by the Pew Research Center found that, as of 2020, about one in five American Jews say the US is too supportive of Israel. Meanwhile, those who say the US is not sufficiently supportive of Israel declined to 19% -- down 12 points since 2013.  There can be no doubt, however, that the relative estrangement accelerated due to the flagrantly divisive roles played by former President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  A year before Trump won the election, Netanyahu defied the second term American President, Barack Obama, by taking an invitation from Republican leaders to denounce Obama's proposed nuclear deal with Iran before a joint session of Congress.  Once in the White House, Trump essentially gave Netanyahu everything for nothing. He moved the American embassy to Jerusalem, recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, reduced American diplomatic engagement with the Palestinian Authority -- all without asking the Israeli prime minister to make genuine concessions to the Palestinians. Then the so-called Abraham Accords brokered by Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner brought Israel diplomatic relations with four Muslim nations -- Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, Sudan and Morocco -- in return for the meager promise to pause new annexation in the West Bank. More treacherously still, the accords reinforced the notion on the right-wing in both Israel and America that somehow the century-long Palestinian national movement had all but disappeared.  We now know how self-deluding that fantasy was. For all of Trump's seeming courtship of American Jews based on his ""bromance"" with Netanyahu, he won only about 30% of the Jewish vote in 2020 -- a proportion well within the norms for Republican presidential candidates over the past 50 years. And the Pew survey found only a minority of those polled approved of Netanyahu's performance (40%) and considered Trump friendly to American Jews (31%).  Which, actually, should come as no surprise. For both Trump and Netanyahu, the moderate and liberal majority of American Jews were never their real audience. Rather, it was evangelical Christians. Ron Dermer, formerly Netanyahu's ambassador to the United States, recently was caught saying the quiet part out loud at a conference hosted by the Israeli newspaper Makor Rishon: ""People have to understand that the backbone of Israel's support in the United States is the evangelical Christians. It's true because of numbers and also because of their passionate and unequivocal support for Israel."" As for American Jews, not only are their numbers much smaller, he said, but they are overrepresented among Israel's critics.  By aligning Israel with both the Republican Party and the Christian right, Netanyahu tacitly associated it with a series of positions on American domestic issues that are anathema to the preponderance of American Jews who reliably vote Democratic -- outlawing abortion, rolling back gay rights, eradicating Obamacare, suppressing voting, and, of course, attempting to seize power through insurrection.  By turning Israel into a partisan wedge issue, and alienating many American Jews in the process, those cynical siblings -- Trump and Netanyahu -- ensured that when the time came for Israel to need bipartisan support and a united front of American Jews neither would be readily available anymore.

Sanders will introduce resolution disapproving $735 million US arms sale to Israel,2021-05-20,"Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders will introduce a resolution on Thursday disapproving of the US sale of $735 million in precision-guided weapons to Israel, according to a draft obtained by CNN.  The sale of the precision-guided weapons was approved by the Biden administration before the latest outbreak of violence between Hamas and the Israeli government. Sanders is the first member of the Senate Democratic caucus to take the extra step to formally disapprove of the sale. Others like Sen. Brian Schatz have expressed concerns about the arms deal, but Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Menendez told reporters earlier this week he was inclined to back it. The Washington Post was the first to report that Sanders would introduce the legislation. Israel has been the largest recipient of US foreign assistance since World War II and this sale is one small part of overall US military support. The US pledged to provide $38 billion in military aid to Israel from 2019 to 2028 in an agreement between the two countries in 2016. Sanders' resolution comes a day after a group of House progressives Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Mark Pocan and Rashida Tlaib unveiled a resolution in the House to block the sale. The effort is likely more symbolic than something that would result in the blocking of the deal but is the latest example of progressives putting pressure on the Biden administration to take a stronger position in the Middle East conflict. The $735 million weapons sale to Israel is unlikely to be stopped by Congress, according to a source familiar with the matter told CNN Wednesday. That's because this sale is going through an expedited congressional review process, which gives Congress a 15-day window to take action to stop the sale. The review process ended Wednesday and as there is a requirement for the committees of jurisdiction to act to block the bill, there's no chance of that happening. The window has basically closed, the source said. There are also expedited review processes for arms sales to NATO, Japan, South Korea, Israel, Australia and New Zealand, the source said. The growing number of civilian deaths in Gaza is causing worry inside the White House as officials work the phones with partners in the region, but President Joe Biden has not called for a ceasefire, despite the Democrats' push for him to do so. In recent days, the President and officials on his national security team have routinely said that Israel has the right to defend itself. Biden on Wednesday dramatically escalated his public pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to end the fighting with Hamas that has stretched into a 11th day. The White House said Biden told Netanyahu ""that he expected a significant de-escalation today on the path to a ceasefire"" in the raging violence.

"5 things to know for May 20: Capitol riot, Covid-19, Gaza, policing, South China Sea",2021-05-20,"It's World Bee Day! Did you know bees ""dance?"" And can use tools? There are lots of fascinating things to discover about these petite pollinators.  Here's what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.  (You can also get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Congress The House voted yesterday to set up an independent, bipartisan commission to investigate the January 6 riot. And even though Republican leadership was against it, 35 Republicans voted for the legislation. That chunk of GOP vote, while comparatively small, represents a revolt of sorts against their leader, Rep. Kevin McCarthy, who pushed strongly for the bill's defeat. It also sets up a tougher battle in the evenly divided Senate, where Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has also voiced his opposition. A Republican vote against the commission is generally seen as an indication of loyalty to former President Trump, or at least the political landscape he shaped. A US Capitol Police officer anonymously sent a letter excoriating Republicans who voted against the commission, expressing ""profound disappointment.""  2. Coronavirus A Covid-19 booster shot will likely be needed within a year of initial vaccination to keep up immunity, Dr. Anthony Fauci says. He added that variant-specific boosters may not be needed. That's yet another reason to get even more Americans vaccinated, which is a top priority as initial demand and enthusiasm flags. In Europe, the EU has agreed to allow entry to vaccinated travelers from countries with low infection rates, easing longstanding travel restrictions in the bloc. An approved list of ""safe"" destinations should be coming this week, but it's not clear when these changes will be in place. 3. Mideast violence A ceasefire in the bloody Israeli-Palestinian conflict could be ""imminent,"" according to Hamas leaders. The deadly exchange of attacks is past the 10-day mark, and world leaders have been increasing calls for an end to the violence. France is pushing for a resolution at the UN Security Council, and President Biden has been communicating with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Hamas leaders say Egypt and Qatar have proposed solutions for a truce. Despite an apparent uptick in ceasefire efforts, Israel has not publicly signaled much eagerness to pause the conflict. More than 220 Palestinians and 12 people in Israel have died in the fighting. 4. Policing The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department says it will release within 30 days of an incident the names of deputies who shoot a suspect. That's a reversal of past procedures, as the department sometimes concealed deputies' names for months during investigations. LA County is one of several police departments mulling its standards of transparency and accountability in recent months. In Louisiana, new bodycam video released by the Associated Press shows a Black man named Ronald Greene being tased, kicked and punched by officers before his death in 2019. The video, along with AP reporting on footage not publicly shown, appears to conflict with initial police reports, which did not mention troopers using force or arresting Greene. The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division is investigating, along with the FBI. 5. South China Sea Biden had tough words about conflicts in the South China Sea during his graduation address to the United States Coast Guard Academy. The President singled out maritime competition with Russia and China, and said the US has to protect critical international waterways to keep such powers from gaining undue influence. Just hours later, a US Navy warship sailed near disputed Beijing-controlled islands in the South China Sea, performing what the Navy calls a ""freedom of navigation"" operation. Beijing, which claims almost the entire body of water as its territory, balked at the move and said the warship violated its sovereignty.

Hamas predicts Mideast ceasefire is 'imminent' amid growing global pressure,2021-05-19,"A ceasefire in the bloody Israeli-Palestinian conflict could be ""imminent, possibly within 24 hours,"" Hamas officials told CNN Wednesday, as world leaders dialed up pressure on both sides to end the fighting. Israel, however, has not commented on the possibility of a ceasefire deal. Concerns have been growing over the worsening humanitarian situation, as the conflict raged for a 10th day Wednesday, pushing the Palestinian death toll to more than 220 people -- including more than 60 children -- and 12 people in Israel, including two children.   The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) said Tuesday that 11 children in Gaza between the ages of 5 and 15 had been participating in its trauma treatment program before Israeli airstrikes killed them in their homes.  NRC Secretary General Jan Egeland expressed outrage at what he called a ""maddening, crazy exchange of rockets and missiles,"" and said both Israeli politicians and generals, as well as Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants in Gaza, should be held accountable. ""What they're doing is killing children,"" he told CNN's Zain Asher.  Karl Schembri, NRC's regional media adviser, told CNN Wednesday that the organization has dealt with children ""who had absolutely terrifying, violent nightmares, that make them unable to function."" ""The violence, there's no escape from it. This is not like going to some frontline, which you can avoid. This is the frontline coming to your bedroom,"" Schembri said. Calls for a truce A Hamas leader on Wednesday described a ""positive atmosphere"" around talks to reach a ceasefire agreement with Israel, ""thanks to the support of our Egyptian and Qatari brothers,"" who proposed different solutions.  But Israel has not publicly signaled much eagerness to pause the conflict. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said earlier Wednesday that he was ""determined to continue this operation until its objective is achieved: to restore quiet and security to you, citizens of Israel."" The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) earlier said strikes would likely continue for days to come. ""I especially appreciate the support of our friend US President Joe Biden, for the State of Israel's right to self-defense,"" Netanyahu said. US President Joe Biden had told Netanyahu ""that he expected a significant de-escalation today on the path to a ceasefire,"" according to the White House. France circulated a motion for a resolution for the UN Security Council to approve, providing momentum to spur an end to the turmoil. The Council, however, has been unable to approve a legally non-binding statement on the issue, blocked by the United States, which told the Council any UN action is not timely and won't help de-escalate fighting. ""We are calling for a ceasefire, which is what we sent to the UN Security Council. There are very active discussions with the Americans on this subject in particular,"" French government spokesman Gabriel Attal said at a news conference in Paris. Israel has conducted more than 1,800 air strikes on Gaza since violence erupted over a week ago, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Information. The ministry estimates that the Israeli air campaign has inflicted more than $323 million dollars of damage to the Palestinian enclave. On Wednesday, dozens of Israeli warplanes launched a series of airstrikes on several Hamas targets, including ""a weapons depot"" located in offices belonging to Hamas' internal security headquarters in Khan Yunis, and ""a command and control center"" in Rafah, the Israeli Air Force (IAF) said. The 25-minute-long attack destroyed ""about 40 underground targets,"" the IAF said in a tweet, adding that about 3,750 rockets had been fired from Gaza as of Wednesday morning, of which 550 had failed and fallen within Gaza. It's unclear how many of those rockets were intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome defense system. The IDF has said previously that the system intercepts more than 90% of the rockets targeted. The IDF has also twice tried to target the leader of Hamas' military wing, Mohammed Deif, over the past 10 days, a military source in Israel confirmed to CNN on Wednesday. On each occasion, he escaped, the source said. No details about the dates or location of the attempts to kill Deif were provided. Deif leads the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades and has been an influential planner of attacks for more than 20 years. He has long been an IDF target, suffering multiple injuries during previous attempts on his life, including the loss of both legs in 2006, according to Israeli media reports.  The official also gave the most detailed Israeli explanation yet of why it destroyed a building housing international media outlets Al Jazeera and the Associated Press, among others, over the weekend.  The official said the Al-Jala'a building contained the electronic department of the military wing of Hamas, which was researching and developing high-end capabilities for attacks on Israel. The Israeli military has not provided evidence of Hamas's presence in the building, and CNN has not been able to verify the claim. Demolishing the building, rather than a more targeted strike, has drawn intense criticism.  Reporters Without Borders, an NGO that works to protect journalists around the world, said it was calling on the International Criminal Court to investigate whether deliberately targeting media outlets constitutes a war crime.   But Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of ""deliberately"" operating near buildings like hospitals and schools, thereby endangering civilians who risk becoming human shields. In Gaza, more than 72,000 people are considered internally displaced, many of them finding shelter in dozens of schools, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Four Palestinians, including a local journalist, were killed and 10 others wounded in overnight Israeli raids on Gaza Wednesday, according to the official Palestinian news agency WAFA.  The journalist, Yusef Abu Hussein, was a broadcaster with Gaza radio station Al Aqsa Radio. He was killed in an Israeli strike targeting a house near the Sheikh Radwan cemetery, north of Gaza City, the WAFA report said. In another development, four rockets were launched from Lebanon into Israeli territory on Wednesday afternoon, the IDF  said. Israel responded with artillery fire.  A high ranking Lebanese security source told CNN that the rockets were fired from the area of Seddiqine, in south Lebanon. The source did not say the extent of the damage caused by the Israeli artillery response, but added that the  Lebanese Army and United Nations peacekeeping force intensified their patrols last week in the area in an effort to prevent further launches from Lebanon.","{'neg': 0.185, 'neu': 0.672, 'pos': 0.143, 'compound': -0.128}",45,153.0,0.0,0.7996666666666666,0.20033333333333334,0.5890333333333333,0.149,0.776,0.075,-0.9984,26.5065,50.352564285714294,189.0,0.26641568405139837
Biden dramatically scales up the pressure on Netanyahu as decades-long relationship faces its most consequential moment,2021-05-19,"President Joe Biden on Wednesday dramatically escalated his public pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to end the fighting with Hamas that has stretched into a 10th day, as their decades-long relationship faces a stern test. The White House said Biden told Netanyahu ""that he expected a significant de-escalation today on the path to a ceasefire"" in the raging violence. The statement was a signal Biden is losing patience with Netanyahu, a leader he has known for four decades. The description of the call -- the fourth between President and Prime Minister over the past week -- reflected growing concern in the White House over the conflict. Previously, administration officials said their objective was to keep pressure on Israel limited to private conversations. But that appeared to shift after the White House revealed publicly that Biden had set a short deadline for tamping down the violence. The White House did not specify what would constitute a ""significant de-escalation."" And Netanyahu, speaking after visiting an Israel Defense Forces command center Wednesday, said he was ""determined to continue this operation until its objective is achieved: to restore quiet and security to you, citizens of Israel."" ""With every passing day we are striking at more of the terrorist organizations' capabilities, targeting more senior commanders, toppling more terrorist buildings and hitting more weaponry stockpiles,"" he said in a video posted to Twitter standing outside the IDF's command center. He added he ""especially appreciate(s) the support of our friend US President Joe Biden,"" without mentioning Biden's new deadline. On the call, which occurred early Wednesday morning, the President adopted a direct and firm tone, according to a person briefed on the matter. In response, Netanyahu offered Biden no specific pledge to wind down the violence. Biden has grown increasingly eager for the fighting to end, according to officials, but has been wary of publicly applying pressure on the Prime Minister, believing the tactic would backfire. But Netanyahu's comments that he plans to continue the operation in Gaza until Hamas targets are taken out have strained US patience, according to officials. Biden made clear to Netanyahu on the call that international pressure would increase if the military campaign continues.  The current US assessment is that Israel is close to running out of fixed targets in Gaza, according to a US official who is tracking the situation closely. At this point, the US roughly calculates that Hamas likely still has thousands of rockets in their inventory, the official said. ""Our focus has not changed. We are working toward a de-escalation to a sustainable calm,"" deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters aboard Air Force One after Biden's call. ""The way that our approach is to make sure that we do this quietly, intensively, in a diplomatic way."" Wednesday's call was the latest in a steady racheting-up of pressure on Israel to end the violence. After a phone conversation Monday, the White House said for the first time that Biden expressed support for a ceasefire, a subtle but clear signal to Israel that the President was feeling pressure as scores are killed in the campaign against Hamas.  Before the Monday call, Biden had not been expected to publicly mention a ceasefire, according to people familiar with the discussions. Aides advised him to stick with the behind-the-scenes approach. But the call was much firmer in tone than the White House revealed publicly, according to people familiar with the matter. A White House official told CNN Biden that is ""always direct and straight forward"" during talks with world leaders, including Netanyahu. ""The role the United States is going to continue to play is maintaining a quiet and intensive channel for diplomacy, not providing a public analysis of the global and domestic reaction to the violence on the ground,"" the official said.  Long relationship put to the test The developments are the latest chapter in a long history between Biden and Netanyahu, who have regularly put forward public shows of solidarity even when the mood is tense behind the scenes. Dispatched to Israel in 2010 by then-President Barack Obama to reassure skeptical leaders, Biden was touched to learn Netanyahu -- a man he'd known for almost 30 years -- had planted a circle of trees in honor of his mother at a forest in Jerusalem. ""My love for your country was watered by this Irish lady, who was proudest of me when I was working with and for the security of Israel,"" a grinning Biden told Netanyahu at his official residence. ""That's a great honor."" A second surprise a few hours later was decidedly less welcome.  With Biden still in the country, Israel announced the approval of 1,600 new homes in Ramat Shlomo in East Jerusalem -- considered an illegal settlement under international law -- infuriating the United States and undermining Biden, who'd just stood alongside the country's leader to declare ""our friendship is real."" Netanyahu later claimed to have known nothing about the timing for the settlement plans. But the move caused already-apparent rifts to deepen with the Obama administration and left Biden enraged, according to a person familiar with his reaction. ""He was humiliated,"" recalled Bruce Jentleson, who at the time was serving as a policy planning aide at the State Department. ""It was really in-your-face."" Eleven years later, as the worst violence in years flares between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza, Biden is again testing his friendship with Netanyahu. The two men have spoken four times in the past week, with each subsequent call described by the White House using progressively more urgent language to characterize Biden's message. As Israel has faced international blowback over its strike last weekend on a high-rise building in Gaza that housed the Associated Press and Al-Jazeera, US officials have privately been pushing Israel to publicly disclose, without jeopardizing sources and methods, the information they had that justified the air strike. Israeli officials have publicly said they shared evidence with the US that Hamas had a presence in the now-destroyed building, leaving some in the administration frustrated with what they see as Israel's attempt to drag the US into the back-and-forth over whether the attack was justified.  Finding the right tone  As Biden and top officials take a firmer line with their Israeli counterparts, they have picked up some signals that the Israeli campaign may start to wind down in the coming days, according to one person familiar with the discussions. While the person did not elaborate or provide a specific timeline, the conversations have served to bolster the belief inside the administration that the path of ""quiet but intensive"" diplomacy, which they've pursued and relentlessly messaged publicly, is the right course of action. The person described the strategy of pursuing the conversations behind the scenes as a calculation that Israelis would recoil at public pressure -- a lesson other officials said was gleaned from the experience of the Obama administration, when relations with Netanyahu reached new lows. ""Biden is an old hand in these kinds of situations and I think he understands very well that jamming an ally in public is not going to get the results that you want,"" said Ambassador Martin Indyk, the former Obama administration Mideast peace envoy who is now a distinguished fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""He's engaging in very deft diplomacy in which first of all he makes clear that he's in Israel's corner, he's got Netanyahu's back, Israel has a right to defend itself,"" Indyk said. ""He establishes his credentials as sympathetic to Israel and supportive of Israel and its right to defend itself so that when it comes time to turn to Netanyahu and say, you know, 'It's time to wrap it up,' he has credibility. And when he does that, he'll do it in private."" How to strike the right tone has been subject of internal debate, people familiar with the matter said. ""There has been some jockeying up to this point between how firm Biden has wanted to be with Israel, versus what his (national security) team has wanted, which is to go further,"" said a former national security official familiar with the deliberations.  The official pointed to a call earlier in the renewed conflict between national security adviser Jake Sullivan and his Israeli counterpart Meir Ben-Shabbat, in which Sullivan ""reiterated the United States' serious concerns about the potential evictions of Palestinian families."" The call provoked a minor diplomatic dust-up, with Israel subsequently urging the US to stay out of the conflict in Jerusalem. After, the call readouts turned more moderate in tone. Even as Biden and administration officials have lately become tougher in their private calls, the White House has suggested that making those entreaties publicly would not be constructive. ""The best way to end an international conflict is typically not to debate it in public,"" press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters aboard Air Force One on Tuesday. A decades-old relationship under the microscope For Biden, the current Middle East crisis is the latest and most consequential chapter in a long relationship with a leader he first met during their days as young, ascendent politicians. They first met when Netanyahu was posted at the Israeli embassy in Washington. In the subsequent decades, as Biden rose to become chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Netanyahu made a habit of calling him at his home to discuss foreign policy, a person familiar with the call said. Even after the settlement debacle, the two men eventually reconciled. ""Bibi, I don't agree with a damn thing you say,"" Biden once claimed to have told Netanyahu, ""but I love you."" The quip, which Biden made during remarks to a group of Jewish Americans in 2014, neatly summed up his relationship with a leader whose actions during the Obama administration caused barely veiled contempt from American officials.  Aside from the settlement episode in 2010 -- which prompted a furious Biden, hours after dining with Netanyahu and his wife, to issue a statement condemning ""the substance and timing of the announcement"" -- Netanyahu enraged Obama administration officials with his attempts to scuttle talks with Iran over its nuclear program, including during an address to Congress in 2015 that neither Republican leaders who invited Netanyahu nor the Israelis ran past the White House.  ""There's this sort of bond between Israeli politicians and American politicians,"" said Aaron David Miller, a longtime former Middle East negotiator who served in Republican and Democratic administrations. ""Biden's views began to change,"" Miller said, after the embarrassment of the 2010 settlement episode followed by Netan","{'neg': 0.128, 'neu': 0.872, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.296}",64,154.0,0.08600000000000001,0.8259000000000001,0.08825000000000001,-0.00407058823529412,0.089,0.814,0.096,0.7357,-0.2605176470588237,46.93299663865547,212.0,0.22138205961629936
Israeli jets pound Gaza as rocket fire resumes and Palestinians hit streets to protest,2021-05-18,"Israeli warplanes continued to pound Gaza on Tuesday and rocket fire into Israel resumed after a brief lull, as Palestinian protesters hit the streets in cities across the West Bank and elsewhere. Thousands gathered in various towns in the West Bank, including Ramallah and Hebron, on Tuesday after a number of Palestinian groups, including Hamas militants in Gaza and Fatah in the West Bank, called for mass strikes. ""The first priority for the Palestinian political leadership now is to have Israel stop its crimes and massacres against our people in Gaza,"" Wasel Abu Yousef, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization's (PLO) Executive Committee in Ramallah, told CNN on Tuesday. Israel imposed a partial closure on the West Bank on Tuesday, an Israeli security source told CNN, with only men older than 45 and Palestinian construction workers with work permits allowed to enter Israel. Israeli airstrikes continued through the night into Tuesday. The Israel Defense Forces said warplanes had struck nine rocket launch sites in Gaza on Tuesday in addition to targeting a tunnel system in northern Gaza, several residences of Hamas commanders and an anti-tank squad in Gaza City. The Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health said 217 people, including 63 children, had been killed and 1,500 others injured in the current round of violence. More than 58,000 people are considered internally displaced, many of them finding shelter in dozens of schools, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Israel briefly allowed trucks carrying international aid into Gaza for the first time since the conflict began last week, but Israeli authorities halted the entrance of aid trucks in response to mortar fire at two border cross crossings. Monday night and early Tuesday morning had brought a brief respite in southern Israel from militants' rockets. The Israel Defense Forces did not report any warning sirens overnight, the first time in a week Israel went a night without rocket fire from Gaza. The attacks resumed later Tuesday, with one mortar killing two civilians at an agricultural packaging factory on the Israeli side of the Gaza border, bringing the total number of dead in Israel to 12 since violence erupted just over a week ago. Sirens also sounded once again Tuesday in Ashkelon and other towns, sending residents fleeing again into shelters. Now into its second week, this is the deadliest Israeli-Palestinian confrontation since the two sides fought a war in 2014. Speaking Tuesday following a visit to the Israeli air force base at Hatzerim, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said operations would continue ""as necessary to restore peace to the citizens of Israel."" Referring to Israel's attacks on Hamas and Islamic Jihad, Netanyahu said: ""I have no doubt that we took them back many years."" ""I'm sure all our enemies around see what price we're charging for the aggression against us, and I'm sure they'll learn the lesson too,"" he added. Around dawn, the IDF destroyed an office building near Gaza. An advance warning was given that the tower would be targeted, witnesses said, and there were no reports of casualties. Israel has not commented on the incident. The destroyed building was among several pieces of infrastructure used by civilians that have been targeted by the IDF. Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of ""deliberately"" operating near buildings like hospitals and schools, thereby endangering civilians who risk becoming human shields. Over the weekend, Israeli forces destroyed a building housing offices for international media outlets Al Jazeera and The Associated Press, claiming it contained Hamas military intelligence assets. Hamas has denied that allegation. Dozens of Israeli jets bombed more than 9 miles (14 km) of Hamas' tunnel system in Gaza Sunday night into Monday morning and targeted 14 residences Monday that the Israeli military said belonged to commanders from the Palestinian militant group. Hamas authorities and video from the ground showed a health clinic in Gaza City damaged by an Israeli airstrike on a nearby target, its windows blown out. The Ministry of Health in Gaza said the clinic was one of its main coronavirus testing centers. The ministry earlier warned the destruction of medical facilities could lead to a surge of Covid-19 cases because those fleeing to shelters would be ""exposed to the spread of infectious diseases, especially the danger of spread of the coronavirus."" A spokesperson for the IDF told CNN on Tuesday that it targeted the main operations center of the Hamas internal security forces in the Rimal neighborhood, and that the building was close to the clinic. As Israel continued to trade airstrikes with rockets fired from Gaza on Tuesday, protests took place in a number of cities. Thousands raised the Palestinian flag and chanted in support of Gaza at a rally in the West Bank city of Ramallah. Some of the protesters burned tires and there were some clashes with Israeli forces near a checkpoint, said Dr. Mustafa Barghouti, president of ​the Palestinian National Initiative, who attended the demonstration. Thousands of women and children also took part in a demonstration in Al-Bireh, north of Ramallah. Some protesters were heard chanting, ""One hand is planting collaborators, another hand is planting freedom, cover the martyrs with flags, no peace, and no surrender."" One 30-year-old protester in Al-Bireh told CNN they would take ""to the streets until we can put an end to the humiliation and indignity that we have to live through."" At another protest in east Jerusalem, George Zeidan, co-founder of Right to Movement Palestine, complained about the restrictions ""on our movement as we're crossing and going between family, going to school, going to work, going for a run, going for a party."" ""Whatever we're doing we're always faced by oppression by the Israeli army,"" he added. ""Just like in apartheid South Africa, this has to end,"" demonstrator Tawfeek Haddad told CNN. ""Palestinians will not be second-class citizens or kicked out of their place."" Israel's government has previously rejected that comparison. In April, the country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs described a report by Human Rights Watch as ""preposterous and false"" after it accused the Israeli government of committing crimes of apartheid. A 25-year-old Palestinian was killed, and two Israeli soldiers were wounded in an altercation in Ramallah, according to health authorities in the West Bank and the IDF. The IDF said it responded to incoming live rounds at its position which resulted in two soldiers getting wounded in the legs. Calls for ceasefire Attempts to negotiate a truce between Israel and militants in Gaza has so far proven difficult. German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke with Jordanian King Abdullah II on Tuesday; both leaders supported efforts to reach a ceasefire, according to Merkel's spokesperson. US President Joe Biden voiced support for a ceasefire Monday during a telephone call with Netanyahu and ""discussed US engagement with Egypt and other partners towards that end,"" a White House description of the call read. Egypt and Qatar's efforts to broker a truce have stalled over two main points, a senior Hamas leader with direct knowledge of mediation efforts told CNN on Sunday. One stumbling block is Israel's insistence that Hamas must initiate the ceasefire, at least three hours before Israel, at which point Israel would follow. Hamas flatly rejected this proposal, the Hamas leader said. The Hamas source said the other hurdle is Hamas' insistence that any ceasefire must include the ending of Israel's ""provocations"" at the Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem -- the third holiest site in Islam -- and a resolution of the situation in Sheikh Jarrah, an East Jerusalem neighborhood where several Palestinian families face eviction. A pro-Jewish settler organization called Nahalat Shimon is using a 1970 law to argue the owners of the land in question before 1948 were Jewish families, and so the current Palestinian landowners should be evicted and their properties given to Israeli Jews. Palestinians say restitution laws in Israel are unfair because they have no legal means to reclaim property they lost to Jewish families in the late 1940s in what became the state of Israel.","{'neg': 0.268, 'neu': 0.732, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.5267}",51,155.0,0.144,0.7716666666666666,0.08433333333333333,-0.16523333333333337,0.128,0.814,0.058,-0.9988,-8.426900000000002,22.378482352941184,224.0,0.09990393907563029
Top Democrat reverses plan to send letter on Israel arms sale at urging of Biden administration,2021-05-18,"Rep. Gregory Meeks, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, is no longer expected to send a letter to the Biden administration calling for the $735 million arms deal between the US and Israel to be delayed despite plans to do so as of last night, three sources familiar with the situation told CNN on Tuesday. Meeks' decision -- a reversal of his plans from last night -- came after there was further engagement between members of the committee and senior administration officials late Monday on how the administration is approaching the ongoing of violence between the Israeli government and Hamas.  Biden administration officials urged Meeks not to send the letter and agreed to brief members of his committee on its Israel policy, two of the sources said.  Meeks acknowledged that he decided against sending the letter when asked about the move Tuesday.  ""The purpose of the letter initially was to make sure that there's dialogue, conversation. We're going to have a meeting with the administration tomorrow where the issues and the questions that one may have will be able to be asked and that was the purpose of considering the letter,"" he told reporters. But Meeks' move not to urge Biden administration officials to halt the arms sale to Israel has frustrated some progressives in his own party who are against the arms sale and are pressuring the administration to call for a cease-fire, two of the sources said.  ""This is what we should have expected in electing Meeks,"" one progressive House aide told CNN. ""He sent us a little flash bulb of progressive hope last night. We genuinely feel dumb believing it was real."" The letter was meant, in part, to put pressure on the administration to call for a ceasefire and for the Israelis to agree to one. President Joe Biden said he would support a ceasefire during a call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday, but he has not called for one.  However, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi did call for a ceasefire on Tuesday, saying in a statement: ""Now, after more than a week of hostilities, it has become even more apparent that a ceasefire is necessary. There must be a serious effort on the part of both parties to end the violence and respect the rights of both the Israeli and Palestinian people.""  A 'pretty shocking' about-face ""The goal was not to get a briefing from the administration here the goal was to get a ceasefire to stop the violence,"" said a congressional aide, describing the about-face as ""pretty shocking."" Asked Tuesday if Meeks was going to send a letter requesting the weapons sale to Israel be delayed given the continued violence and progressive Democrats' pressure, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said Meeks is in conversations with the Biden administration. ""I think Chairman Meeks has indicated that he's going to pursue discussions with the administration on this."" Hoyer said Meeks is not planning to send a letter asking the Biden administration to delay the sale because it was his understanding that ""the administration has agreed to have some discussions with the members of the Foreign Affairs Committee."" Hoyer said in his opinion, ""I'm not for placing conditionality on the consummation of that transaction."" Asked for comment about the move by Meeks, the National Security Council referred CNN to the chairman's office.  The Biden administration's proposed $735 million weapons sale to Israel includes precision-guided bombs that can be used to hit smaller targets and are intended to decrease the potential for collateral damage, according to two sources familiar with the arms deal notification sent to Congress earlier this month. The bombs, known as GBU-39 small-diameter munitions, were included in the weapons package notification along with Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs), the sources said. The Washington Post previous reported that JDAMs were part of the proposed sale. But one of the sources told CNN that the GBU-39 small-diameter munitions are arguably more relevant to Israel's potential bombing of small targets, including soft structures, vehicles and gatherings of people, than JDAMs even though the actual shipments of those weapons are not yet off production lines and ready for export. Ongoing violence Now into its eighth day, this is the deadliest Israeli-Palestinian confrontation since the two sides fought a war in 2014, and Netanyahu vowed Monday that Israel would ""continue to strike at the targets of terrorism."" Israeli airstrikes continued through the night into Tuesday. The Israel Defense Forces said warplanes had struck nine rocket launch sites in Gaza on Tuesday in addition to targeting a tunnel system in northern Gaza, several residences of Hamas commanders and an anti-tank squad in Gaza City. The Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health said 213 people, including 61 children, had been killed and 1,400 others injured in the current round of violence. More than 2,500 Palestinians are now without homes and more than 38,000 are considered internally displaced, according to the United Nations. After a brief lull Hamas rocket attacks resumed on Tuesday one mortar killing two civilians at an agricultural packaging factory on the Israeli side of the Gaza border, bringing the total number of dead in Israel to 12.  Details about the proposed sale emerged as a number of congressional Democrats were ramping up pressure on the Biden administration to more forcefully engage on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as violence in the region intensifies, revealing a delicate shift in the way Democrats have talked about Israel for decades and a small crack in the party on foreign policy. The change in tone -- subtle but noteworthy -- comes as there is still disagreement within the party about how far to push. Those on the progressive fringes are trying to block a $735 million arms deal made with Israel, but there's little chance of that happening in Congress given the timeline on Capitol Hill. ""It would be appalling for the Biden Administration to go through with $735 million in precision-guided weaponry to Netanyahu without any strings attached in the wake of escalating violence and attacks on civilians,"" Rep. Ilhan Omar, a progressive Democrat from Minnesota, said in a statement Monday. ""If this goes through this will be seen as a green light for continued escalation and will undercut any attempts at brokering a ceasefire.""","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.893, 'pos': 0.107, 'compound': 0.2023}",34,156.0,0.17833333333333334,0.7976666666666667,0.023999999999999997,-0.5305666666666666,0.14,0.803,0.057,-0.9987,-18.039266666666666,15.759815686274518,241.0,0.06539342608412663
Biden mostly sticks to touting green energy and infrastructure during trip complicated by Middle East violence,2021-05-18,"President Joe Biden used his Tuesday visit to the critical battleground state of Michigan to tout his green energy and infrastructure plans, and largely shied away from weighing in on the recent eruption of violence in the Middle East. Biden tourned and delivered remarks at a Ford plant in Dearborn, Michigan -- home to one of the largest Arab American populations in the United States -- to highlight the new F-150 electric truck on Tuesday. He made only a passing mention of the unrest in the Middle East between Hamas and Israel, telling a Michigan congresswoman who has family in the West Bank that he would do ""everything"" he could to keep them safe. Upon his arrival at the Detroit Metropolitan Airport, Biden spoke with Michigan Democratic Reps. Debbie Dingell and Rashida Tlaib -- the first Palestinian American woman to serve in Congress -- for several minutes. Tlaib has been harshly critical of Biden's stance on Israel and told MSNBC on Monday that the administration was ""finally"" engaging with her after four months of outreach on her behalf.  Asked what had been discussed on the tarmac, Dingell said ""a lot of things"" and added that they don't negotiate in public. The President made a passing mention of the ongoing violence in the Middle East toward the top of his remarks at the plant, telling Talib that he will do everything he can do to see that her family in the West Bank remains safe.  ""I want to say to you that I admire your intellect, I admire your compassion and I admire your concern for so many other people. And it's from my heart, I pray that your grandmom and family are well. I promise you I'm going to do everything to see that they are, on the West Bank,"" Biden said.  Over the weekend, Dearborn was among a slew of cities across the world where demonstrations in support of Palestinians in Gaza took place. Hundreds of protesters turned out for the event, according to local media reports and across social media, where a direct warning was given to Biden. ""Tuesday, he will be here,"" one speaker at the Dearborn demonstration said. ""We have heard from him. He will hear from us."" Protesters also organized two demonstrations on Tuesday near Biden's tour, but the President was not expected to catch a glimpse of the protesters on his tour or routes in and out of the area.  Biden visited the Ford River Rouge Complex, where the new F-150 Lightning is being built. This is Ford's answer to the electric vehicle, aims to turn America's best-selling pickup truck into an electric option, built by union workers. The President got a sneak peek at the truck, which will be formally unveiled Wednesday from Ford World Headquarters. The truck is scheduled to launch next year. The Michigan trip comes amid the administration's push to promote Biden's economic agenda and garner public support for the President's multitrillion-dollar infrastructure proposals. The White House has said Biden wants to see real progress by Congress on the infrastructure proposal by Memorial Day, which is less than two weeks away. During remarks at the plant, Biden pitched his American Jobs Plan and criticized what he saw as the Trump administration's ""shortsighted rollback"" of vehicle emissions and efficiency standards.  ""They announced infrastructure week, and they announced it and announced it and announced it -- every week for four years and didn't do a damn thing!"" Biden said of the Trump White House ""Didn't get the job done. Folks, the rest of the world is moving fast. They're moving ahead. They're not waiting for the United States of America. Government, labor and industry working together have to step up and we have a playbook that'll work.""  The Biden administration faces increased pressure over its response to escalating violence between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, which has led to a growing number of civilian deaths.  Since the outbreak of hostilities eight days ago, about 3,150 rockets have been fired from the Gaza Strip at Israeli territory, according to the Israel Defense Forces. The Israel Defense Forces said about 460 of those rockets fell inside Gaza itself.  As of Monday, 10 Israelis have been killed as a result of rocket fire from Hamas' military wing, according to the Israel Defense Forces. In Gaza, the death toll has risen to 212 and includes 61 children, the Hamas-run Palestinian Health Ministry of Gaza said. A top Biden ally in Michigan told CNN ahead of the trip that no meetings were scheduled between the President and local leaders who are demanding an end to violence against Palestinians and urging Biden to increase pressure on Israel. ""The timing of the trip couldn't be worse, but this is not why he's coming,"" a top Democrat in Michigan said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the feelings among Palestinian-Americans in Dearborn. ""The anger toward President Biden is very real."" The uptick in civilian casualties is causing worry inside the White House as officials work the phones with partners in the region.  Biden -- long a supporter of Israel and one of its vocal defenders during his time in the US Senate -- has continued to hold the position that Israel has a right to defend itself against Hamas' rocket attacks. The White House has also resisted calls from Democratic lawmakers to publicly pressure Israel into a ceasefire, even as Israel has indicated that the violence will continue.  But during a call with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday, Biden ""expressed his support for a ceasefire and discussed US engagement with Egypt and other partners towards that end,"" the White House said in a carefully worded statement. Netanyahu also indicated in a video released earlier Monday that ""the directive is to continue to strike at the targets of terrorism."" The Biden administration is placing enormous stock in efforts by Egypt and Qatar to broker an end to the violence, according to officials.  In recent calls with Netanyahu and Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, the White House said Biden raised the issue of civilian casualties. And the White House has signaled increased concern in its public messaging about the conflict.  ""We recognize and agree that watching the lives lost of Palestinian children, of these families, the fear you see in the eyes of the Israeli people, it is heartbreaking. It is heartbreaking,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said during a press briefing on Monday.  Psaki also said the White House is working through ""quiet and intensive"" diplomacy to bring violence to an end in the Middle East amid calls from Democrats and foreign allies to speak out more forcefully on the matter. The Dearborn trip was Biden's second visit to Michigan since taking office. He visited the Pfizer plant in Portage in February. Michigan was among the states across the upper Midwest that Biden turned from red to blue last November, defeating former President Donald Trump by nearly 3 percentage points.","{'neg': 0.278, 'neu': 0.622, 'pos': 0.1, 'compound': -0.5719}",51,157.0,0.023333333333333334,0.888,0.08866666666666667,0.26703333333333334,0.094,0.83,0.076,-0.9924,13.6187,13.398515686274516,245.0,0.05468781912765108
Why Biden is not diving into Middle East peace brokering,2021-05-18,"Another tragic Middle East conflict is offering fresh insight into Joe Biden's sometimes ruthless calculations about the purpose of his presidency and his view of America's global role. The violence between Israel and the militant Palestinian group Hamas is the latest crisis that failed to distract Biden from what he sees as his core task -- ending the pandemic and rescuing the economy.  Biden declined Monday to publicly condemn Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Gaza raids in reprisal for Hamas' rocket attacks, a move consistent with a record of strong support for Israel that is longer than that of many previous presidents. Domestic and international heat for Biden is escalating, however, amid rising Palestinian civilian casualties -- including the deaths of children in Gaza -- and the Israeli destruction of a building in the enclave used by the Associated Press and other media groups. Other presidents might have felt the need to appear on camera to call for calm or to at least offer public condolences for the deaths of civilians. Some administrations would have launched a Middle East peace shuttle by now. But in a region where the ""peace process"" long ago expired -- a region with complications that Biden had hoped to avoid, if possible -- there's no easy payoff for spending limited US political or diplomatic capital. ""We've made clear that we are prepared to lend our support and good offices to the parties should they seek a ceasefire,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in Denmark, in remarks emblematic of a low wattage US diplomatic push and reluctance to urge Israel to stop before it is ready. Biden's only public event on Monday focused on the pandemic response and expanding vaccine deliveries abroad. The White House stagecraft sent a clear and obvious message about the Middle East. ""I think the President frankly wants this thing to go away,"" said former Middle East peace negotiator and CNN Global Affairs analyst Aaron David Miller. ""He is shackled with the greatest challenge of national recovery since Franklin Roosevelt. He is picking his foreign policy spots carefully."" Biden's undiminished focus on the pandemic, and the clear desire to keep his public appearances limited to the matter at hand, recalls his refusal to be drawn into a narrative of crisis as thousands of child migrants poured over the border during his first 100 days in office and set conservative media on fire. Biden has also kept his eye on refashioning the economy to help workers rather than running down a liberal wish list that includes expanding the Supreme Court. Behind-the-scenes diplomacy   Characteristically, Biden kept his work on the conflict on Monday private, speaking to Netanyahu over the phone while Blinken made multiple calls to regional foreign ministers. Egypt, a key interlocutor with Hamas, is a key target of US diplomacy.   Biden told reporters he'd talk about the chat with the Israeli leader afterward but his team called a travel photo lid (meaning there would be no further public events for Biden on Monday) at 1:48 p.m. ET, before the conversation took place. A statement about the call released by the White House caused a flurry of attention with a line saying that ""the President expressed his support for a ceasefire."" The comment did send a subtle signal that Biden's patience is not infinite with Netanyahu, who has indicated he is not yet ready to halt operations against Hamas' facilities and underground tunnels. Yet it also lacked a time frame by which point the political collateral damage on the President will become a hinderance to his support. In a region as treacherous as the Middle East, coded messages in an unsigned White House news release rarely move the needle. The statement and recent blind quotes from nameless officials about rising ""concern"" came across more as spin to relieve pressure on Biden from left-wing Democrats as a real attempt to change the dynamics of a violent confrontation. 'Too many lives have been lost'  But criticism of Israel is rising -- at least within Biden's own party. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat who has strong pro-Israeli credentials and underscored its right to defend itself, offered a striking call for a ceasefire. ""I want to see a ceasefire reach quickly and mourn the loss of life,"" Schumer told reporters, saying he agreed with a statement from Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut and GOP Sen. Todd Young of Indiana that stated, ""As a result of Hamas' rocket attacks and Israel's response, both sides must recognize that too many lives have been lost and must not escalate the conflict further."" Those comments may reflect pressure on Schumer himself from within the Democratic Party, not least from fellow New Yorker Rep Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has been scathing of Israel, which she called an ""apartheid"" state. Another senior Democrat, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Jack Reed, is one of 28 senators in the President's party to publicly call on Biden to secure a ceasefire.  ""Hamas is a terrorist group. They operate under the principle of terror. And Israel, as a nation-state, has a higher burden of proof to show that these are necessary military raids,"" Reed told CNN's Jake Tapper. The Democratic opposition is more a danger sign to Israel than Biden, as it threatens to weaken the Israelis' position on Capitol Hill. Several prominent Democrats are, for instance, calling for the administration to attach conditions to a $735 million shipment of precision-guided weaponry for Israel, a package that is currently on a fast-track approval process through Congress. Israel's operation is causing further stress in the delicate balance between progressives in the Democratic Party — like Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota -- and older, down-the-line pro-Israel party leaders like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California. That will mean hard work to come for Israeli diplomats here. Biden shields Netanyahu   Conservative media has blamed Biden for the violence, citing his efforts to revive a nuclear deal with Iran, which funds Hamas. But it's hard to see how the President could have given Netanyahu more cover.  He has not criticized Israel over clashes between its police and Palestinians inside the compound of the Al Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem or over possible evictions of Palestinians in a neighborhood of East Jerusalem, the part of the city they see as the future capital of their prospective state. Progressives in Washington blame those incidents for setting off the tinderbox that has been building between Israelis and Palestinians for months. In an earlier sign of Biden's shielding of Netanyahu, two diplomats told CNN that the US blocked public statements from the United Nations Security Council on the conflict. Even so, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, laid a political trap for the President should the White House harden its line against the Israelis. ""President Biden must remain strong against the growing voices within his own party that create false equivalence between terrorist aggressors and a responsible state defending itself,"" McConnell said. No upside to coming down hard on Israeli PM  Biden knows the downside of publicly feuding with Netanyahu.  President Barack Obama's pressure on the Israeli Prime Minister, and Netanyahu's willingness to play politics in Washington behind his back, scarred the administration in which Biden served as vice president. Given Biden's antipathy to a Middle East peace push, there's little reason to make an enemy of the Israeli Prime Minister. Still, Biden's position is not without risks. Rapidly rising civilian casualties would pose questions about why he was not more aggressive in trying to stop the fighting. A possible upside of recent days is that Netanyahu could come out of any ceasefire agreement in Biden's debt. How the President might choose to use such chits is unclear. Possibly he could prevail on the Israeli leader -- if he can stay prime minister amid his country's political uncertainty after yet another inconclusive election -- to avoid provocations like the most controversial settlement projects. In the event of a deal with Tehran that could see the US return to the international nuclear deal, Biden may try to ease Netanyahu's public opposition. The Israeli Prime Minister is, however, so adamantly against the idea that Biden would soon burn off any accrued political capital. The President's strategy has also underscored the narrow focus of a foreign policy mostly notable for his cementing of a more adversarial posture to China. He is signaling that in the post ""America First"" era, there will be no return to the days when Washington invested huge efforts to broker Middle East peace deals. The most that might be expected from this limited effort is support for a ceasefire. That in itself is a recognition that the structures that permitted US-sponsored ""peace processes"" and efforts to consecrate a Palestinian state no longer exist. An Israeli political move to the right and the Palestinian divide between Hamas in Gaza and aging, ineffective leaders on the West Bank mean this is a moment without promise. In fact, the current conflict is likely to further diminish Biden's incentives for getting involved.","{'neg': 0.096, 'neu': 0.629, 'pos': 0.275, 'compound': 0.507}",58,158.0,0.1301,0.7956000000000001,0.0743,-0.09946000000000002,0.127,0.749,0.124,-0.105,-5.768680000000002,-18.876664313725485,258.0,-0.07316536555707552
Rift grows within Democratic Party over Israeli-Palestinian conflict as violence intensifies,2021-05-18,"A number of congressional Democrats are ramping up pressure on the Biden administration to more forcefully engage on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as violence in the region intensifies, revealing a delicate shift in the way Democrats have talked about Israel for decades and a small crack in the party on foreign policy. The change in tone -- subtle but noteworthy -- comes as there is still disagreement within the party about how far to push. Those on the progressive fringes are trying to block a $735 million arms deal made with Israel, but there's little chance of that happening in Congress given the timeline on Capitol Hill. ""It would be appalling for the Biden Administration to go through with $735 million in precision-guided weaponry to Netanyahu without any strings attached in the wake of escalating violence and attacks on civilians,"" Rep. Ilhan Omar, a progressive Democrat from Minnesota, said in a statement Monday. ""If this goes through this will be seen as a green light for continued escalation and will undercut any attempts at brokering a ceasefire."" Sen. Brian Schatz, a Democrat from Hawaii, said of the deal and whether Congress should block it, ""I am not ruling anything in or out, but I think given the events of the last three or four days that has to be part of the conversation too."" Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Menendez said he hadn't seen the details of the arms deal but that he was likely to support the deal moving forward: ""I think it preexisted the present conflict. We have a long history of supporting Israel as a security ally and in its own defense. So I would say yes."" Democrats on the House Foreign Affairs Committee met Monday to discuss the situation in Israel and the proposed weapons sale. Sources familiar with the meeting told CNN that there was a spirited discussion of the situation. Members expressed a range of views. One cohort of lawmakers aggressively homed in on the arms sale issue, while another insisted that Israel deserves the right to defend itself, one source said. Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, along with fellow Democrats on the committee, is expected to send a letter and statement to the White House on Tuesday calling for the arms deal to be delayed, according to two sources familiar with the plan. Meeks is unable to put a formal ""hold"" on the deal at this late point in the formal review process, but the letter could be used as a pressure point to work toward a ceasefire, one of the sources told CNN. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, declined to say whether he backed the deal when asked by reporters Monday. However, he did say that he hoped for a ceasefire. ""I want to see a ceasefire reached quickly and mourn the loss of life,"" Schumer told reporters. On Monday, the White House released a readout of President Joe Biden's call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in which Biden ""expressed his support for a ceasefire and discussed US engagement with Egypt and other partners towards that end."" But the readout stopped short of Biden calling for a ceasefire, a position held by many Democrats on the Hill. ""It appears to be a moment of change even if it is just a recalibration,"" one person familiar with Democratic talks said, also calling that recalibration ""significant."" Sunday marked the deadliest day of the weeklong conflict so far, according to data from the Hamas-run Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza. Israeli airstrikes killed at least 52 Palestinians in Gaza on Sunday, according to the health ministry.  Some Democrats pushed back on the idea that the party had shifted at all on Israel. ""Maybe you see Democrats being a little bit more willing to criticize Israel. That's because the Israeli position has changed, and it is increasingly difficult to imagine a future Palestinian state. I think the narrative of the story is about how Republicans have changed. They used to support a two-state future, and they don't seem to support it today,"" said Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut. ""In Israel, there used to be a belief that it was important for the security of the country, and that certainly isn't a view shared by the current government."" Democratic leaders like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have expressed support for Israel, which traditionally has been the position of the party, but progressives are growing more and more vocal for the administration to condemn Israel and cut off military support to the country until it changes policies toward Palestinians.  ""It's time to have serious conversations about conditioning military aid,"" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a progressive Democrat from New York, said Friday. Even Democrats who have traditionally aligned themselves with Israel have raised concerns. After an Israeli airstrike on Saturday destroyed international media offices in Gaza, Menendez, a strong supporter of Israel, issued one of his strongest statements to date on the conflict.  ""I am deeply troubled by reports of Israeli military actions that resulted in the death of innocent civilians in Gaza as well as Israeli targeting of buildings housing international media outlets,"" said Menendez in the statement.  The New Jersey Democrat continued, ""Given the complexity of Gaza's densely populated civilian areas, and Hamas's shameful record of exploiting that reality by hiding military assets behind the innocent, Israeli authorities must continue taking the conscientious practice of giving advance warning of its attacks to reduce the risk of harm to the innocent.""  He also called for a ""full accounting of actions"" that led to ""civilian deaths and destruction of media outlets.""  Another group of Democrats called for a ceasefire Sunday. More than 25 Democratic senators, led by Georgia Sen. Jon Ossoff, released a joint statement calling for an immediate ceasefire agreement in Israel and the Palestinian territories to ""prevent further loss of life and further escalation of violence."" Murphy, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Near East, South Asia, Central Asia and Counterterrorism, and the ranking Republican member of the committee, Sen. Todd Young of Indiana, released a joint bipartisan statement calling for a ceasefire. ""Israel has the right to defend itself from Hamas' rocket attacks, in a manner proportionate with the threat its citizens are facing,"" they said. ""As a result of Hamas' rocket attacks and Israel's response, both sides must recognize that too many lives have been lost and must not escalate the conflict further. We are encouraged by reports that the parties are exploring a ceasefire. We hope that this ceasefire can be reached quickly and that additional steps can be taken to preserve a two-state future."" Sen. Tim Kaine, who signed on to the letter with Democrats, added on Monday that he thinks the US should aggressively pursue a ceasefire like ""we do in other situations,"" pointing to the Taliban in Afghanistan and the Houthis in Yemen. ""I just can't remember a shooting war where kids were being killed on both sides where the US hasn't aggressively pushed for a ceasefire, and I think we should do the same thing here,"" he said. In addition to a ceasefire, Kaine, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said there are other steps the administration should take too. ""I think it would be good if the Biden team could name a really high-quality nominee to be ambassador to Israel,"" said the Virginia Democrat. ""I think we should try to leverage the Arab nations that have normalized relations with Israel to try to get them to the table to help promote some more stability in the West Bank and Gaza. But I think let's start with the ceasefire."" But Republicans are pushing for Biden to hold the line.  Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, urged Biden on Monday to ""remain strong"" against calls from some in his party for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, arguing it's an ""obscene moral equivalence."" ""We're already seeing some push the false narrative that this conflict is a tragic dispute between two legitimate combatants, where both sides share blame that is roughly equal. What nonsense,"" he said in floor remarks. He added: ""The US needs to stand foursquare behind our ally and President Biden must remain strong against the growing voices within his own party that create false equivalence between terrorist aggressors and a responsible state defending itself.""

"5 things to know for May 18: Coronavirus, policing, abortion, Gaza, Havana Syndrome",2021-05-18,"Help is around the corner for lots of American families. About 39 million households with children will start getting monthly enhanced child tax credit payments on July 15 as part of the government's Covid-19 relief plan.  Here's what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.  (You can also get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Coronavirus The National Nurses United union president is criticizing CDC guidance that vaccinated people can largely forego masks, saying it's confusing and could endanger health care workers. One problem? It relies on an honor system in which unvaccinated people still mask up. At least one local leader has already said such a system just isn't working. President Biden says there will be enough Covid-19 vaccine supply for every American adult by the end of this month, and his administration is pledging millions more vaccine doses to other countries on top of the 60 million already committed. We're also learning more about a coronavirus variant first detected in India that has now gone global. The B.1.617 is a ""variant of concern,"" which means it could be more transmissible, cause more severe disease or evade tests and treatments. Experts think the variant is driving the recent waves of infection in India.  2. Abortion The Supreme Court agreed to take up a key abortion case next term that could pose a major challenge to Roe v. Wade. The case concerns a controversial Mississippi law that banned most abortions after 15 weeks. A federal judge struck down the law in 2018. Now that the court has a 6-3 conservative majority, it could set a new precedent that emboldens other states to enact similarly strict abortion laws. Several already have: South Carolina, Oklahoma and Idaho codified so-called ""heartbeat bills"" this year. Arkansas and Oklahoma enacted near-total abortion bans, and Montana banned the procedure at 20 weeks. None of these bills is in effect yet, with some tied up in court. For the record, polling reveals a majority of Americans want Roe v. Wade to stay in place.  3. Policing Fifteen unions that represent law enforcement officers across the US have endorsed a policing plan that includes an unprecedented shift in the way unions protect bad police officers. Under the plan, law enforcement officers and those in adjacent professions would be encouraged to act as ""active bystanders"" and intervene when another union member is doing something wrong. Meanwhile, a North Carolina DA is set today to reveal the findings of a state investigation into the police shooting of Andrew Brown Jr. What bodycam footage of the April incident, in which deputies shot and killed Brown, actually shows is in dispute. In South Carolina, two deputies involved in the in-custody death of Jamal Sutherland in January have been fired. 4. Mideast violence Biden has expressed support for a ceasefire in the escalating violence between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza. The President mentioned his position on a call yesterday with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and floated the possibility of international diplomatic involvement. Some Democratic leaders want Biden to be more forceful with US engagement in the conflict. Netanyahu, meantime, has vowed to continue strikes against Hamas targets. The US has been in touch with foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, France, Qatar, Egypt and Pakistan, but demands from Israel and Hamas have so far stymied any solutions. Meanwhile, the volley of rocket attacks and airstrikes continues.  5. Havana Syndrome The US is investigating two cases of a mysterious illness that affected White House officials late last year. The cases are consistent with ""Havana Syndrome,"" an inexplicable combination of sensory experiences and physical symptoms that have sickened more than 100 US diplomats, spies and troops around the globe. One of the latest incidents began after the 2020 election when an NSC official passed through a White House gate. Now, the government has revealed it's investigating a second, more serious case from weeks later near another White House entrance. The intelligence community still isn't sure who is causing the strange array of nervous system symptoms or if the episodes can even be called ""attacks.""

"Biden administration notified Congress of $735 million weapons sale to Israel earlier this month, before violence began",2021-05-17,"The Biden administration notified Congress of a proposed US weapons sale to Israel worth $735 million earlier this month, according to two sources familiar with the notification.  The sale of the precision-guided weapons, which the administration approved before the latest outbreak of violence between Hamas and the Israeli government, is now being reviewed by Congress as concerns grow among progressive Democrats about the Biden administration remaining adamant that Israel has a right to defend itself from rocket attacks from Hamas.  Israel has been the largest recipient of US foreign assistance since World War II and this sale is one small part of overall US military support. The US pledged to provide $38 billion in military aid to Israel from 2019 to 2028 in an agreement between the two countries in 2016.   Congress has 15 days to review the proposed sale -- which it received notification of on May 5 -- before it is finalized.  The Washington Post was first to report that the White House had notified Congress of the proposed sale.   The sale is unlikely to be stopped by Congress, according to a source familiar with the matter. That's because this particular sale, like all sales to Israel, is going through an expedited congressional review process, which gives Congress a 15-day window to take action to stop it instead of the usual 30-day review period. With just four days left in the review process, and a requirement for the committees of jurisdiction to act to block the bill, there's virtually no chance of that happening, according to the source. The window has basically closed, the source said.  There are expedited review processes for arms sales to NATO and its member states, Japan, South Korea, Israel, Australia and New Zealand, according to the Pentagon. The State Department does not comment on pending sales, a spokesperson told CNN.    Israel has purchased these precision-guided weapons from the US in the past, and it is believed that they are being used in the current military campaign on Gaza, the two sources familiar with the sale said. This sale is part of routine support to Israel and did not come about due to the recent escalating violence in the region, the sources added.  The growing number of civilian deaths in Gaza is causing worry inside the White House as officials work the phones with partners in the region, but Biden has not called for a ceasefire, despite the Democrats' push for him to do so. In recent days, the President and officials on his national security team have routinely said that Israel has the right to defend itself.  Rep. Ilhan Omar said it would be ""appalling"" if the administration went through with the sale.  ""It would be appalling for the Biden Administration to go through with $735 million in precision-guided weaponry to (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu without any strings attached in the wake of escalating violence and attacks on civilians. If this goes through this will be seen as a green light for continued escalation and will undercut any attempts at brokering a ceasefire,"" the Minnesota Democrat said in a statement.  Over the weekend, Sen. Bernie Sanders called for the US to take a ""hard look"" at the nearly $4 billion in military support the US gives to Israel each year. White House press secretary Jen Psaki showed no indication that the US is willing to review US military assistance to Israel when she was asked about the Vermont independent's comments on Monday.  ""Our message is sometimes you have to step back from politics for a moment. It is not easy to do. And we recognize and agree that watching the lives lost of these Palestinian children, of these families, the fear you see in the eyes of the Israeli people, it is heartbreaking,"" Psaki said. ""We want to bring an end to the violence. We want to de-escalate the situation on the ground. The role we feel we can do that through, the most effective way we feel we can do that, is quiet and intensive diplomacy.""  More than 25 Democratic senators, led by Sen. Jon Ossoff of Georgia, released a joint statement calling for an immediate ceasefire agreement in Israel and the Palestinian territories to ""prevent further loss of life and further escalation of violence."" The statement reflected growing concern in Congress over the escalating violence in the Middle East. Other Democrats have also called for more robust action by the administration to bring about an end to the fighting.   ""I think the administration needs to push harder on Israel and the Palestinian Authority to stop the violence, bring about a ceasefire, end these hostilities and get back to a process of trying to resolve this long-standing conflict,"" Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, said Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation.""  Israeli strikes have killed at least 212 people in Gaza, including 61 children and 36 women, and injured some 1,400 others, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said Monday. Sunday was the deadliest day yet, with more than 50 killed, the ministry said.  Rocket fire from Gaza has killed at least 10 people in Israel, including two children, since the start of the flare-up, according to the Israel Defense Forces. On Monday, a fresh barrage of rockets from Gaza once again set off sirens and sent Israelis fleeing into bomb shelters in Ashdod, Ashkelon and Beer Sheva. At least one residential building in Ashdod was hit, the Israel Defense Forces said. Three people were slightly injured, the Israeli Red Cross said.

"Biden 'expressed his support for a ceasefire' in call with Israeli Prime Minister, White House says",2021-05-17,"President Joe Biden voiced support for a ceasefire Monday as intensifying violence between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza entered a second week. During a telephone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Biden ""expressed his support for a ceasefire and discussed US engagement with Egypt and other partners towards that end,"" a White House description of the call read.  It was the first time the White House officially made mention of a ceasefire in its ongoing efforts to contain the situation. Yet the language stopped short of a full-on demand for a cessation of violence, something some Democrats have been pressuring Biden to make.  Instead, it suggested Biden was seeking a diplomatic way to end the conflict by encouraging a halt to hostilities without calling explicitly for Israel to stand down. A senior administration official told CNN Biden is still not explicitly calling for a ceasefire.  It was the third time Biden has spoken with Netanyahu in a six-day stretch. Notable shifts in the administration's language following each call have revealed heightened levels of concern over the growing conflict. The White House said Monday that Biden reiterated Israel's right to defend itself but ""encouraged Israel to make every effort to ensure the protection of innocent civilians."" They also ""discussed progress in Israel's military operations against Hamas and other terrorist groups in Gaza."" The growing number of civilian deaths in the intensifying battle between Israel and Hamas in Gaza is causing worry inside the White House as officials work the phones with partners in the region. Over the course of the week-long conflict, Biden had resisted calls from fellow Democrats and foreign allies to publicly increase pressure on Israel amid the worsening violence. Biden's hesitance to criticize Israel's actions and initial reluctance to support a ceasefire raised questions about his strategy in the Middle East among Democrats whose approach to the issue has shifted in recent years. Speaking Monday, the White House press secretary Jen Psaki said it would not be ""constructive"" for the White House to reveal every aspect of Biden's conversations. Instead, she said the US was working through ""quiet and intensive"" diplomacy to bring the violence to an end. ""Our focus, our goal, every single action we take, every statement we make, is with the objective of reducing the violence and bring an end to the conflict on the ground,"" she said. ""There are times in diplomacy where we'll need to keep those conversations quieter, we won't read out every component of it,"" she went on. ""But that is the objective, that is the prism through which every action and every comment is being made."" So far, Biden has remained adamant that Israel has a right to defend itself against rocket attacks from Hamas. The last time he addressed the situation in public, Biden said he did not believe Israel was overreacting by pummeling Gaza with airstrikes. Psaki would not say whether his assessment had changed since then. Now, as Israel signals the violence will continue into a second week, Democrats in Washington are calling for Biden to say more. More than 25 Democratic senators, led by Georgia Sen. Jon Ossoff, released a joint statement calling for an immediate ceasefire agreement in Israel and the Palestinian territories to ""prevent further loss of life and further escalation of violence."" The statement signaled the growing concern in Congress over the escalation of violence in the Middle East. Other Democrats have also called for more robust action by the administration to bring about a truce. ""I think the administration needs to push harder on Israel and the Palestinian Authority to stop the violence, bring about a ceasefire, end these hostilities, and get back to a process of trying to resolve this long-standing conflict,"" Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, said Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" Biden has so far shown few signs he is bending to pressure from his party. A longtime supporter of Israel, his politics do not appear to be shifting even as progressives in his party are pushing for a stronger condemnation of Israel.  Asked what Biden's message is to fellow Democrats who have chastised him for not condemning Israeli actions, Psaki said that ""sometimes you have to step back from politics for a moment."" ""It's not easy to do,"" she said. ""We recognize and agree that watching the lives lost of Palestinian children, of these families, the fear you see in the eyes of the Israeli people, it is heartbreaking. It is heartbreaking."" Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, is traveling on an unrelated trip in northern Europe. He said at a press conference in Copenhagen with his Danish counterpart that the US is working ""intensely"" behind the scenes to bring the violence in the Middle East to an end. ""We are ready to lend support if the parties seek a ceasefire. We'll continue to conduct intensive diplomacy to bring this current cycle of violence to an end,"" Blinken said. ""Then we will immediately resume the work, the vital work, of making real the vision of Israel on Palestinian state, existing peacefully side by side with people from all communities able to live in dignity."" Neither Biden nor the White House has explicitly condemned the bombing of the high-rise in Gaza that housed the offices of the Associated Press and Al Jazeera. Israel officials, including Netanyahu, defended the action on Sunday by claiming the building housed Hamas intelligence services. Blinken said Monday the US had requested information about the bombing but that he had ""not seen any information provided."" Netanyahu said on CBS' ""Face The Nation"" that ""we share with our American friends all that intelligence."" ""I will leave it to others to characterize whether any information has been shared and our assessment of that information,"" he said. American officials said the next 72 hours will prove critical in determining whether to apply more pressure to the parties to end the violence. The administration's envoy to the region, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Israeli and Palestinian Affairs Hady Amr, described his mandate during a White House event marking the end of Ramadan on Sunday. ""Tonight, I'm in Jerusalem, having been asked by President Biden to embark on a determined effort to halt the current violence gripping the West Bank and Gaza and Israel and to achieve a sustainable calm,"" he said.  Amr arrived in Israel over the weekend and is expected to meet with senior Israel and Palestinian officials. The US does not engage directly with Hamas, which it considers a terror organization. Instead, American officials say they are hopeful countries that do have influence over Hamas will play a central role in brokering peace. Biden has not yet appointed a special envoy or US ambassador to Israel, though an ambassador nominee is expected as soon as the next two weeks. In his own remarks during the Sunday Eid event, Biden only made passing reference to the situation.  ""We also believe Palestinians and Israelis equally deserve to live in safety and security, and enjoy equal measure of freedom, prosperity and democracy,"" Biden said in pre-recorded remarks. ""And my administration is going to continue to engage Palestinians and Israelis and other regional partners to work towards sustained calm."" Protests in support of Palestinians in Gaza formed in cities across the United States on Sunday, including in the Detroit metropolitan area, home to the largest Arab American population in the United States. Demonstrations took place throughout the weekend, including on Sunday in Dearborn, where Biden is scheduled to visit a Ford plant to highlight the new F-150 electric vehicle on Tuesday. Thousands of protestors turned out for the event, according to local media reports and across social media, where a direct warning was given to Biden. ""Tuesday he will be here,"" one leader of the demonstration said. ""We have heard from him; he will hear from us.""","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.838, 'pos': 0.162, 'compound': 0.4019}",57,162.0,0.0,0.8564999999999999,0.14350000000000002,0.6053666666666667,0.117,0.783,0.1,-0.9873,34.505900000000004,-26.586779999999997,256.0,-0.10385460937499999
Netanyahu vows to continue strikes on Gaza as Israel pounds Hamas targets,2021-05-17,"The Israeli military pounded Gaza with airstrikes on Monday, saying it was targeting the homes and infrastructure of the Palestinian militant group Hamas, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed ""to continue to strike at the targets of terrorism."" The Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health said 212 people had been killed and 1,400 others injured since violence flared last week, in what has become the most serious Israeli-Palestinian confrontation in years. Sixty-one children and 36 women are among the dead, the ministry said.  Meanwhile, Hamas rocket fire from Gaza has killed at least 10 people in Israel, including two children, since the start of the flareup, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). On Monday, a fresh barrage of rockets from Gaza once again set off sirens and sent Israelis fleeing into bomb shelters in Ashdod, Ashkelon and Beer Sheva. At least one residential building in Ashdod was hit, the IDF said. Three people were slightly injured, according to the Israeli Red Cross. The Israel Defense Forces on Sunday released photos purporting to show Hamas rocket installations and tunnel entrances placed in close proximity to civilian infrastructure like hospitals and schools. The IDF said that ""Hamas deliberately and systematically places military targets within the civilian population, exposing their citizens to danger.""   A health clinic hit Dozens of Israeli jets bombed more than nine miles of Hamas' tunnel system in Gaza overnight and targeted 14 residences Monday that the Israeli military said belonged to commanders from the Palestinian militant group. Hamas authorities and video from the ground showed a health clinic in Gaza City damaged by an Israeli airstrike on a nearby target, its windows blown out. The Ministry of Health in Gaza said the clinic was one of its main coronavirus testing centers. At least two floors of the nearby building that was targeted were destroyed, according to a CNN journalist on the scene. The Qatar Red Crescent reported damage to its office inside the building. The ministry earlier warned Monday that Israeli strikes on homes, medical facilities and infrastructure had created the conditions for an ""upcoming wave"" of Covid-19 cases, and that those fleeing to shelters would be ""exposed to the spread of infectious diseases, especially the danger of spread of the coronavirus."" Netanyhau met with leaders from the IDF and the country's security services, saying in a video statement that the IDF was ""doing well."" ""Today (the IDF) has eliminated another senior Islamic Jihad commander, we have hit the Hamas naval unit, and we continue to strike at the underground medium, the Hamas 'metro,' and there are other targets. The Palestinian Authority Ministry of Health in the West Bank condemned the strike on the tunnel system and said that its local administrative office was also damaged. It was not immediately clear if there were any casualties in the attack, nor what the IDF was targeting. Israel's military earlier said it had struck more targets in Gaza in the past week than it did in all of 2020.  Brigadier General Hidai Zilberman, IDF spokesperson, told Israeli Channel 13 News that the IDF believes it has destroyed 80-90% of the rocket manufacturing capacity in Gaza. ""This includes the engineers and developers as well,"" he said. About 3,150 rockets have been fired from Gaza at Israeli territory since last Monday, though the Israeli military said many had either fallen short or been intercepted by the Iron Dome aerial defense system.  Call for a truce grow louder According to the UN, the conflict has left more than 2,500 Palestinians without homes and more than 38,000 are internally displaced.  Many are sheltering in 16 schools run by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, said Stéphane Dujarric, spokesman for the UN Secretary-General António Guterres, in a recorded statement.  ""We continue to actively engage all sides towards an immediate cessation of fire between Israelis and Palestinians,"" he said.   During an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council on Sunday, Guterres pleaded for peace lest an ""uncontainable security and humanitarian crisis"" erupt that would ""further foster extremism"" in Israel, the Palestinian territories and the region writ large.  The US has continued to block the UN Security Council from making a statement on the conflict. But President Joe Biden voiced support for a ceasefire Monday during a telephone call with Netanyahu on Monday. The US President ""expressed his support for a ceasefire and discussed US engagement with Egypt and other partners towards that end,"" a White House description of the call read. On Sunday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken held five calls with the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, France, Qatar, Egypt, and Pakistan during a flight to Copenhagen. Egypt and Qatar's efforts to broker a truce have stalled over two main points, a senior Hamas leader with direct knowledge of meditation efforts told CNN on Sunday.  One stumbling block is Israel's insistence that Hamas must initiate the ceasefire, at least three hours before Israel, at which point Israel would follow. Hamas flatly rejected this proposal, the Hamas leader said.  The other hurdle is Hamas' insistence that any ceasefire must include the ending of Israel's ""provocations"" at the Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem and a resolution of the Sheikh Jarrah eviction threat, the Hamas source said.  Foreign media offices demolished   Israel also found itself on the defensive over the weekend after it levelled a Gaza building containing offices for international media outlets Al Jazeera and the Associated Press. The Israeli military said the building contained Hamas military intelligence assets, a claim that Hamas has denied.  A senior IDF official also defended the strike in a background briefing to reporters. Asked why Israeli forces did not carry out a more targeted strike on part of the building, rather than demolishing all it, the official argued that such ""surgical hits"" would put more civilians at risk. ""We absolutely deny the Israeli occupation claims that Hamas had offices in Al Jalaa Building,"" Fawzi Barhoum, Hamas spokesperson, said in a statement.    ""We stress that these are false claims and an attempt to justify the crime of targeting a civilian facility that included media offices for international channels such as Al Jazeera and the American Associated Press, in addition to residential apartments,"" he added.   Israel says it has shared information with the United States justifying its airstrike on a Gaza high-rise that housed the offices of the Associated Press and other media outlets. But just which American officials have seen that evidence, and whether they find it credible, remained an open question Monday. Blinken says he hadn't seen it. The National Security Council did not comment, instead referring to intelligence channels. And the White House said it couldn't provide any indication of whether the intelligence had even been received.   Reporters Without Borders, an NGO that works to protect journalists around the world, said in a statement it was calling on the International Criminal Court to investigate. RSF Secretary General Christophe Deloire said in a statement on the group's website that ""deliberately targeting media outlets constitutes a war crime,"" and that the Israeli strikes were ""obstructing media coverage of a conflict that directly affects the civilian population.""","{'neg': 0.185, 'neu': 0.815, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.3612}",47,163.0,0.019,0.8855,0.0955,0.21095000000000003,0.1,0.848,0.052,-0.9945,9.914650000000002,-10.903449999999992,245.0,-0.04450387755102038
More than 25 Democratic senators call for immediate ceasefire in Middle East,2021-05-17,"More than 25 Democratic senators, led by Georgia Sen. Jon Ossoff, released a joint statement calling for an immediate ceasefire agreement in Israel and the Palestinian territories to ""prevent further loss of life and further escalation of violence."" ""To prevent any further loss of civilian life and to prevent further escalation of conflict in Israel and the Palestinian territories, we urge an immediate ceasefire,"" the senators wrote in a joint statement first obtained by CNN. CNN has reached out to the White House and National Security Council for comment. This comes as Sunday marked the deadliest day of the week-long conflict so far, according to data from the Palestinian ministry of health in Gaza. Israeli airstrikes have killed at least 52 Palestinians in Gaza Sunday, according to the health ministry. The joint statement from the Democratic senators and two independent senators who caucus with Democrats signals the growing concern in the Senate over the escalation of violence in the Middle East. The recent conflict began at the start of last week, fueled by controversy over planned evictions of Palestinian families in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood of East Jerusalem and restrictions at a popular meeting point near the Old City. Ossoff, who is Jewish, lead the group of senators to release the joint statement. President Joe Biden and the White House have shown little willingness to bend to pressure from progressives calling for more robust condemnation of Israel's actions. Speaking at the White House last week, Biden said he did not detect a disproportionate response to Hamas' rocket attacks from Israel. ""One of the things that I have seen, thus far, is that there has not been a significant overreaction. The question is, how we get to a point where -- they get to a point where there is a significant reduction in the attacks, particularly the rocket attacks that are indiscriminately fired into population centers,"" Biden said at the White House when asked whether Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is doing enough to stop violence from escalating. The list of senators who joined the statement includes Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Tom Carper of Delaware, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, Tim Kaine of Virginia, Angus King of Maine, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Patrick Leahy of Vermont, Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico, Ed Markey of Massachusetts, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Chris Murphy of Connecticut, Patty Murray of Washington, Jack Reed of Rhode Island, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Brian Schatz of Hawaii, Tina Smith of Minnesota, Jon Tester of Montana, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, Mark Warner of Virginia, Raphael Warnock of Georgia, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island. Murphy, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Near East, South Asia, Central Asia and Counterterrorism, and the ranking member of the committee, Republican Sen. Todd Young of Indiana, also released a joint bipartisan statement calling for a ceasefire Sunday after the bloodiest day so far in the latest conflict. ""Israel has the right to defend itself from Hamas' rocket attacks, in a manner proportionate with the threat its citizens are facing,"" they said. ""As a result of Hamas' rocket attacks and Israel's response, both sides must recognize that too many lives have been lost and must not escalate the conflict further. We are encouraged by reports that the parties are exploring a ceasefire. We hope that this ceasefire can be reached quickly and that additional steps can be taken to preserve a two-state future.""","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",18,164.0,0.236,0.737,0.027,-0.9313,0.105,0.848,0.047,-0.9907,-16.7634,-22.29884999999999,208.0,-0.10720600961538457
Israel-Palestinian conflict marks its deadliest day as scenes of horror unfold in Gaza,2021-05-16,"Israel bombed the house of Hamas' Gaza leader and obliterated a family's home in Gaza as Hamas launched more than 100 rockets toward Israel on Sunday, marking the deadliest day of the week-long conflict so far, according to data from the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza and Israeli authorities. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had bombed the house of Yahya Sinwar, Hamas' leader since 2017, in southern Gaza's Khan Yunis neighborhood early Sunday morning. IDF spokesperson Brig. Gen. Hidai Zilberman told local media that Sinwar had been unhurt in the airstrike.  Two Israeli airstrikes in Gaza killed at least 43 Palestinians -- including eight children -- and injured 50 others, most of whom were women and children early Sunday, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. With the latest casualties, the death toll in Gaza has climbed to a total of 197, including at least 58 children and 34 women, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. Since the beginning of the Israeli airstrikes on Gaza this week, at least 1,235 Palestinians have been injured, with the number expected to rise, the health ministry said, as paramedics continue to carry out search operations. Ten Israelis have been killed by rockets fired from Gaza, according to the IDF. Airstrikes continued into the early hours of Monday morning in Gaza. The Israeli Air Force said on Twitter its fighter jets had targeted nine residences that it said belonged to high-ranking Hamas commanders in Gaza. Israel claimed the homes were being used as ""terror infrastructure"" and some were used to store weapons. The IDF said in a separate tweet that fighter jets targeted a tunnel located near a kindergarten and mosque in southern Gaza. The IDF accused Hamas of ""deliberately"" placing military assets in ""the heart of its civilian population."" Palestinian medical and civil defense teams said they rescued five children from the rubble on Sunday morning. Scenes of the rescue operation show a young girl with a bloodied head injury lifted from the wreckage by a team of paramedics. Her expression alternates between shock and horror. The IDF said in a Twitter post on Sunday morning that Hamas' militant wing had fired 120 rockets between 7 p.m Saturday and 7 a.m. local time Sunday, of which 11 fell in Gaza. IDF spokesperson Zilberman added Sunday that they had targeted dozens of rocket launchers, with the ability to fire multiple rockets at a time. Defense Minister Benny Gantz said in a Tweet on Saturday that ""Israel has no interest in escalation, but is ready for any scenario,"" echoing an Israeli military official, who said on Friday that Israel is prepared to continue hitting ""quality targets"" for an ""extended period of time.""  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu underscored that resolve on Sunday, saying that he will do ""whatever it takes to restore order,"" and that ""it will take some time."" On Saturday, Netanyahu said it will ""respond forcefully"" in Gaza ""until the security of our people is reinstated and restored,"" and said the country is trying to avoid civilian casualties from its strikes. The IDF on Sunday released photos allegedly showing Hamas rocket installations and tunnel entrances placed in close proximity to civilian infrastructure like hospitals and schools, claiming that ""Hamas deliberately and systematically places military targets within the civilian population, exposing their citizens to danger."" The recent conflict began at the start of last week, fueled by controversy over planned evictions of Palestinian families in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood of East Jerusalem and restrictions at a popular meeting point near the Old City.  It has since escalated rapidly into one of the worst rounds of violence the area has seen since the 2014 Gaza War, which saw more than 2,200 Gazans killed during the fighting, approximately half of them civilians, including more than 550 children, according to a United Nations report. On Sunday, six Israeli Border Police officers were injured in Sheikh Jarrah after a car ""hit and ran over"" officers stationed at a police checkpoint, a police spokesperson said. The driver, a 42-year-old male, was ""shot and killed,"" according to Israeli emergency services. While not claiming responsibility for the attack, Hamas' military wing described the incident as a ""heroic run-over operation"" which they say was carried out by a young Palestinian man. Rioting and violent clashes between Arab and Jewish citizens have also spilled out across several Israeli cities in the past week, including Lod, Bat Yam and Acre, leading Netanyahu to warn against ""lynching"" by either community. And that violence has boiled over to the occupied West Bank, where on Friday, at least 11 Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces during violent clashes, marking the largest number of people killed in a single day in the West Bank in years, according to the Gaza-based Palestinian Health Ministry. In a statement, UN Secretary General António Guterres said he was ""dismayed"" by the rising number of civilian casualties. ""The Secretary-General reminds all sides that any indiscriminate targeting of civilian and media structures violates international law and must be avoided at all costs,"" the statement said. US President Joe Biden spoke with both Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Saturday. In his call with the Israeli leader, Biden ""reaffirmed his strong support for Israel's right to defend itself against rocket attacks from Hamas,"" and also expressed his concern for the Palestinian people. Abbas, in a readout after the phone call with the American President, called on him to intervene in putting an end to ""Israeli attack on Palestinian people everywhere."" Early Saturday, a 5-month-old baby named Omar was the lone survivor in a house that was hit and destroyed in an Israeli airstrike hit in the al-Shati refugee camp, killing 10 members of the his family -- including eight children, according to the infant's father Mohammad Hadidi. At least 20 other Palestinians were wounded after several nearby houses were damaged in the Israeli airstrike, the Palestinian News Agency WAFA reported. Hadidi told CNN that his wife had taken their four children -- who were mourning the recent loss of another family member --  to their uncle's house on Saturday to celebrate the end of Ramadan. ""We had a martyr in the family that was killed on the first day of Eid, so the kids didn't get the chance to celebrate or wear their new clothes, so their mother took them to her brother's house and stayed there overnight,"" Hadidi said.  ""They were so happy to get away from the grief, but they didn't know it was their turn,"" he said. Hadidi lost his wife, three children, and his brother and sister-in-law and their four children in the strike. ""They didn't do anything bad to anyone, they were looking for a happy place to celebrate Eid, Hadidi said, crying: ""What were they punished for?"" Militants in Gaza responded to the airstrikes on the refugee camp on Saturday with rockets targeting the Israeli cities of Tel Aviv, Beersheba, Ashdod, and Sderot. A 55-year-old Israeli man was killed early Saturday afternoon after a rocket hit a series of buildings in a residential area in a Tel Aviv suburb called Ramat Gan, bringing Israel's death toll to 10, according to Israel's emergency service. Shortly after, the Jala'a building -- which contained offices for international media outlets Al Jazeera and the Associated Press, among others -- was hit by an Israeli airstrike. Speaking on Sunday, Netanyahu said that the building was ""a perfectly legitimate target,"" adding:  ""One of the, I think, AP journalists said we were lucky to get out. No, you weren't lucky to get out. It wasn't luck. It's because we took special pains to call people in those buildings, to make sure that the premises were vacated,"" he said. The AP said in a statement that they were ""shocked and horrified that the Israeli military would target and destroy the building housing AP's bureau and other news organizations in Gaza,"" and said that they ""have had no indication Hamas was in the building or active in the building."" ""This is something we actively check to the best of our ability. We would never knowingly put our journalists at risk,"" AP said. AP has called on the Israeli government, who says the building contained Hamas military intelligent assets, to ""put forward the evidence."" ""This strike is an incredibly disturbing development,"" the statement added, concluding: ""The world will know less about what is happening in Gaza because of what transpired today."" Reporters Without Borders, an NGO that works to protect journalists around the world, said in a statement it was calling on the International Criminal Court to investigate.  RSF Secretary General Christophe Deloire said in a statement on the group's website that ""deliberately targeting media outlets constitutes a war crime."" He also said the Israeli strikes were ""obstructing media coverage of a conflict that directly affects the civilian population.""

"Palestinians deserve the same security, equality and right to a homeland as the Israelis",2021-05-17,"There are no winners in the current battle between Hamas and Israel. The loss of life on both sides -- while unequal -- is heartbreaking. As of Sunday evening, 197 Palestinians had been killed, including eight children who died Saturday when an Israeli airstrike destroyed their home in a Gaza refugee camp. At least 10 Israelis, including a 5-year-old boy, have been killed by Hamas rockets.   If history serves as a guide, however, after a ceasefire is reached, the conflict will slowly fade from the headlines, the world will go back to its business and the Palestinians will largely be forgotten -- yet again. For those who sincerely want to see a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, this time must be different.  The world, and especially the Biden administration, cannot look away but must engage on the question of Palestine. It's 2021 -- a homeland for Palestinian Christians and Muslims is long overdue, as is safety and equality for Palestinians.  The Palestinian-Israeli conflict has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember.  My Palestinian father, born in the 1930s in what was then Palestine (controlled by Britain until 1948), but now the West Bank, would tell me stories about it when I was a child in the late 1970s. This wasn't a political discussion, rather it was one focused on how my relatives and other Palestinians navigated daily life under Israeli military occupation. The limited freedom of movement, the myriad of Israeli military checkpoints that denied personal self-determination, my grandmother's land being stolen by Israeli settlers, etc. For the decades that followed, few American elected officials on either side of the aisle prioritized Palestinian human rights. Thankfully, Sen. Bernie Sanders changed that during the 2016 presidential campaign when he declared, ""We are going to have to treat the Palestinian people with respect and dignity."" Sanders, while defending Israel's right to exist, called for the United States to stop being ""one-sided"" in the conflict.  While unthinkable a decade ago, last week a diverse group of 25 Democratic House members -- including Reps. Marie Newman, Ayanna Pressley, Mark Pocan and Judy Chu -- called on the Biden administration to condemn the effort of ultra-nationalist Jewish groups to evict Palestinians from their homes in East Jerusalem.   And Thursday, a group of House Democrats rallied on the floor in support of Palestinian human rights. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez noted that while President Biden stated Israel has a right to defend itself, she asked, ""But do Palestinians have a right to survive?"" adding, ""If so, we have a responsibility to that."" Pressley made an impassioned speech, first linking the Black Lives Matter movement to Palestinian human rights, then declaring, ""We cannot stand idly and complicitly by and allow the occupation and oppression of the Palestinian people to continue.""  Others joined in these speeches, including Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a fellow Palestinian American, who summed it up well: ""Palestinians aren't going anywhere."" She is correct. According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, there are more than 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank and 2.1 million in Gaza. The Association for Civil Rights in Israel says there are about 358,000 Palestinians in Jerusalem. The reality, though, is that Israelis aren't going anywhere either, with a population of more than 9 million, nearly 7 million of whom are Jewish. As Pressley rightly stated Thursday, ""The destinies of the Israeli and Palestinian people are tied."" But though the futures of both are linked, it does not mean the respective people are equal -- either in terms of resources, political power or level of suffering. For example, in Gaza, 95% of the residents don't have access to clean water and 80% of the population relies on international aid to survive. And Human Rights Watch recently released a 213-page report in which it accused the Israeli government of engaging in an ""apartheid"" system of polices that favor Israeli Jews over Palestinians in both Israel and the territories. (In January, the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem made the same charge.) Bluntly, a broad peace deal currently looks all but impossible given the leadership. Who can Israeli officials speak with in Hamas? Conversely, when it comes to the Palestinians in the West Bank, who could be their partner for peace when current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has declared there will be no Palestinian state on his watch and has vowed to annex large swaths of the West Bank? Not forgetting about the Palestinians is more than pushing for peace -- it's the United States taking a stand for Palestinian human rights. For example, there's not just the threatened evictions of Palestinians from their homes and the ""sweeping, decades-long restrictions on the freedom of movement and basic civil rights"" for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza detailed by Human Rights Watch, but also the alarming rise of Israeli extremists who have taken to the streets to menacingly chant, ""Death to Arabs.""   Once a ceasefire is reached, President Biden must make it clear that Palestinians are deserving of the same security, equality and homeland as Israelis. The days of denying the humanity of Palestinians must end. And very importantly, Biden should declare he's willing to leverage the $3.8 billion in annual aid the United States provides to the Israeli government -- along with America's leadership role in the world -- to achieve that. This even-handed approach is step one in hopefully laying the foundation for a lasting, just peace deal.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.833, 'pos': 0.167, 'compound': 0.34}",39,166.0,0.044,0.885,0.07,0.3182,0.067,0.823,0.11,0.9941,12.409799999999999,45.90517500000001,218.0,0.21057419724770646
The latest violence between Israel and Palestinians will end when both sides can declare victory. But it will be no more than a truce,2021-05-16,"The current explosion of violence between Palestinians and the state of Israel is yet to inflict as many casualties as the devastating 2014 Gaza conflict, but in many ways is a bleaker and more foreboding episode. Confrontation is not confined to aerial bombardment and rocket fire over Gaza and southern Israel but has spread to the streets of Israeli towns, to neighborhoods of Jerusalem and across the West Bank.  Ominously it is fueled by deepening polarization, where the voices of militancy on both sides are the loudest, and those calling for coexistence are scarcely a whisper.   On the lawn of the White House on September 13, 1993, then Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin stood alongside PLO leader Yasser Arafat and declared: ""We who have fought against you the Palestinians, we say to you today in a loud and clear voice, enough of blood and tears, enough."" It was the closest the two sides have come to breaking a cycle of violence that is now a century old. The holy grail of a two-state solution seemed within reach. If that moment in 1993 was the high water mark of dialogue, the region now seems trapped in a vortex of enmity -- while the international community falls back on calls for ""restraint"" but is bereft of fresh ideas to attack the roots of the conflict.  Perhaps the most alarming feature this time round is that Israeli towns with Arab populations, like Lod and Haifa, have been sucked into this spiral. Arabs make up about 20% of the population of Israel proper. Even in 2014, and during the Palestinian intifadas, the peace largely held in these towns. But in the last week Palestinian and Jewish youth have fought street battles, places of worship and homes have been torched, curfews have been imposed.  ""We have completely lost control of the city, and the streets are witnessing a civil war between Arabs and Jews,"" said the mayor of Lod Yair Revivo last Wednesday.  The daily discrimination felt by many Arabs living in Israel is heaped on other grievances that are part of this latest spasm of conflict. It began with attempts by Jewish nationalists to have Palestinian families evicted from their homes in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood of East Jerusalem -- and was fueled by clashes between police and Palestinians around the Haram al Sharif/Temple Mount during Ramadan, always an incendiary time of year.  Enter Hamas -- and notably not the Palestinian Authority -- setting itself up as the defender of all Palestinians -- demanding Israel withdraw its forces from the al Aqsa mosque and Sheikh Jarrah or pay a ""heavy price.""   And so the extremes hold sway: confrontation is the only currency.  In some ways this suits both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas. Through confrontation they reinforce their respective bases and hollow out voices of moderation. Hamas can claim it is the true representative of Palestinians -- just as the aging President of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, postpones elections. Were negotiations -- promoted by the international community -- to restart, Hamas would be the loser as its modus vivendi is armed resistance to the Jewish state.   Emma Ashford, from the New American Engagement Initiative think tank, argues that the ""recent cancellation of Palestinian elections means Hamas is desperate for a chance to prove itself, hence the rocket attacks and its attempt to tie its cause more closely to what's happening in East Jerusalem."" For his part, Netanyahu depends on ultra-nationalists to remain in office and has successfully moved the terms of debate during his long tenure as Prime Minister. Two years ago his more centrist rival Benny Gantz promised to ""strengthen the settlement blocs and Golan [Heights], where we won't leave ever. The Jordan valley will be our border, but we won't let millions of Palestinians living beyond the fence endanger our identity as a Jewish state."" The once-mighty left wing of Israeli politics now seems bereft of energy and ideas.   Perversely, to some analysts, Netanyahu needs Hamas. The alternatives are reassuming control over the teeming open prison that is Gaza, at enormous cost -- or seeing even more militant groups such as Islamic Jihad or ISIS-inspired Salafi groups -- gain sway among a young population radicalized by every chapter of violence. Beyond the political opportunism, the cause of the conflict -- what it means to belong -- grows ever deeper roots. In 2018, Netanyahu's government enacted a law that enshrined the right of national self-determination as ""unique to the Jewish people"" -- not all citizens of Israel. It demoted Arabic from an official language to one with ""special status.""   It has also promoted further Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank. As of last year, more than 440,000 Jews lived in the West Bank, according to Israeli human rights group Peace Now. The current attempts to evict Palestinian families in East Jerusalem fit this pattern.  Exactly 100 years ago this month, long before the state of Israel came into existence, riots broke out in what was then Jaffa. Dozens of Palestinians and Jews were killed. A British commission of inquiry (the UK controlled Palestine and was given a League of Nations mandate to administer the territory in 1922) concluded the riots stemmed from ""a feeling among the Arabs of discontent with, and hostility to, the Jews, due to political and economic causes, and connected with Jewish immigration."" Those underlying causes have never been erased, through 1948, when the Jewish state was born in what Palestinians call al-Nakba, or ""the catastrophe;"" the war of 1967 when Israel took control of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza; the Palestinian uprisings at the turn of this century and the Gaza conflicts since. As CNN's Ben Wedeman trenchantly observed in Bethlehem last week: ""The young Palestinians throwing rocks, their fathers probably threw rocks too. And these Israeli soldiers firing off tear gas, their fathers probably did the same.""  The two-state solution that was the bedrock of international diplomacy and enshrined by UN resolutions has become less and less viable as the West Bank has morphed into a patchwork of Palestinian towns and Jewish settlement, where occupation has begun to look like annexation. An in-depth report for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace last month described a two-state solution as the ""scaffolding [that] sustains occupation and is structurally incapable of delivering peace and human security."" A one-state solution that would include full citizenry for the inhabitants of West Bank and Gaza is demographic poison to many Israelis and inconceivable in the current atmosphere.   This cycle, like that in 2014, will likely be ended when both sides feel they can claim ""victory"" despite the destruction and the deaths of civilians, and when Egypt and the United States can fashion the terms of a truce. But it will be no more than a truce.   After the 2014 conflict, Hamas set about rebuilding its inventory of rockets and its tunnel complexes while tightening its grip on Gaza. It is difficult to see anything other than this process repeating itself.   In the words of Martin Indyk, who has decades of experience in the Middle East as a US diplomat, ""the Biden administration's approach so far suggests that Washington will be comfortable accepting this unhappy ending.""","{'neg': 0.203, 'neu': 0.797, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.6542}",47,167.0,0.087,0.88475,0.02825,0.0,0.122,0.793,0.085,-0.9948,0.0,11.399275000000012,208.0,0.054804206730769287
Tensions between Israel and Palestinians are sky-high. Here's what you need to know,2021-05-12,"Conflict between Israelis and Palestinians boiled over this week, escalating rapidly into one of the worst rounds of violence between the two sides in the last several years. An already tense situation prompted by moves to evict Palestinian families from their homes near the Old City in Jerusalem exploded at one of the holiest sites in the city, known to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary and to Jews as the Temple Mount.  Israeli police entered the Al Aqsa Mosque and clashed with Palestinians inside the sacred site, firing stun grenades while Palestinians threw stones.   The resulting clashes there and in other parts of the Old City left hundreds of Palestinians and some Israeli police officers injured. Palestinian militant groups in Gaza joined the fray by firing rockets into Israel, which responded with airstrikes.  A United Nations representative warned the situation was ""escalating towards a full-scale war."" Since then, hundreds more rockets have been fired by Palestinian militant groups from Gaza and Israel has stepped up its artillery and airstrike bombardment of the territory. Israel has also called up reservists, fueling fears of an imminent ground invasion in Gaza.  Meanwhile, several cities in Israel have been rocked by rioting and violent clashes between Arab and Jewish citizens. Putting a lid on the violence may not be easy. Political, religious, and nationalist factors all play a role in the situation. Why is this happening now?  The city had been on edge for several weeks, with Palestinians angered over the closure of a popular plaza just as Ramadan was beginning, and as a years-long legal battle to remove seven Palestinian families from their homes in East Jerusalem appeared set to end with eviction. The families have been living in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood, just north of the Old City, since 1956 -- in an arrangement brokered by the United Nations to find homes in Jordanian-controlled East Jerusalem for families who lost their property in what became the state of Israel in 1948. An Israeli nationalist organization called Nahalat Shimon is using a 1970 law -- passed after Israel gained control over East Jerusalem -- to argue that the owners of the land before 1948 were Jewish families, meaning the current Palestinian occupants should be evicted and their properties given to Israeli Jews. Palestinians contend that restitution laws in Israel are unfair because they have no legal means to reclaim the property they lost to Jewish families in the late 1940s in what became the state of Israel.  Israel's Supreme Court was due to hear an appeal in the Sheikh Jarrah case on May 10. But Israel's Attorney General asked for a delay. The legal battle over the homes in Sheikh Jarrah has reignited a simmering debate about who has claim to the city, its holy sites, and its history. Jerusalem has always been the most sensitive part of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Small changes to a delicate situation can ignite massive protests. And extremist voices are often on hand and make themselves known. Hundreds of Jewish extremists marched through Jerusalem at the end of April chanting ""Death to Arabs,"" on a night when there were a number of incidents reported of the city's Jewish and Arab communities targeting one another for attack. Earlier this week, the annual Jerusalem Day march, which normally works its way through the Muslim Quarter of the Old City, was re-rerouted in an attempt to avoid further escalation.  What is East Jerusalem and why is it so sensitive? For nearly two decades after the founding of the State of Israel in 1948, the city of Jerusalem was divided. East Jerusalem was controlled by the Jordanians, while West Jerusalem was controlled by the Israelis, who made it their capital.   Crucially, the Old City of Jerusalem and its holy sites were in East Jerusalem.  The Old City is home to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre where Christians believe Jesus Christ was buried.  It is home to the Al Aqsa Mosque where Muslims believe the Prophet Mohammed journeyed on his Night Voyage, as well as the site where they believe he ascended to heaven.  And it is home to the holiest site in the world for Jews, the stone where they believe Abraham came to sacrifice his son, Isaac, and where the First and Second Temples stood in ancient times. During the Six-Day War in 1967, Israel captured East Jerusalem, placing the entire city under Israeli control. Israel also captured the West Bank, the Golan Heights, and the Sinai Peninsula. The latter was returned to Egypt under the 1979 peace agreement, but East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights have remained under full Israeli control. The Palestinians enjoy limited autonomy in Gaza and parts of the West Bank, but Israel maintains control of all borders and security. What is the reality in Jerusalem today? The entire city of Jerusalem is under Israeli control. Israel says there is no difference between the city's east and west, instead describing the city as its united capital. (Even so, the city is largely self-segregated. East Jerusalem is largely Palestinian, while West Jerusalem is largely Israeli. Israeli cab drivers often refuse to drive to locations in East Jerusalem.)  But international law considers East Jerusalem, the West Bank, the Golan Heights, and Gaza as occupied territory under United Nations Security Council Resolutions, though that characterization is disputed by Israel. United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334, passed in 2016, said that Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian territory have ""no legal validity"" and constitute a flagrant violation of international law. International law does not distinguish between settlements in the West Bank or settlements in East Jerusalem, considering them both occupied territory.  The Old City, and more specifically the Al Aqsa compound, is governed by its own agreement known as the Status Quo.  Israel is in charge of security on the site, and Jordan, through an Islamic organization called the Waqf, administers the religious sites. In normal times, visitors of all faiths are allowed to visit the complex, but only Muslims are allowed to pray there. Palestinians view East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state.  What do Israel and Palestinian officials say about the Sheikh Jarrah case?  Palestinian leaders say the effort to evict families from their homes is nothing less than ""ethnic cleansing"" aimed at ""Judaizing the holy city,"" the official Palestinian news agency Wafa reported. Israel says the conflict is simply a ""real-estate dispute."" The Foreign Ministry accused the Palestinian Authority and militant groups of ""presenting a real-estate dispute between private parties, as a nationalistic cause, in order to incite violence in Jerusalem."" More than 700,000 Palestinians were displaced during the creation of the state of Israel, according to the United Nations agency supporting Palestinian refugees. What is the international community's position?  The effort to evict Palestinian families from the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood has been widely criticized.  State Department spokesman Ned Price said in early May that the United States is ""deeply concerned about the potential eviction of Palestinian families in Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan neighborhoods of Jerusalem, many of whom have lived in their homes for generations. As we have consistently said, it is critical to avoid steps that exacerbate tensions or take us farther away from peace. This includes evictions in East Jerusalem, settlement activity, home demolitions, and acts of terrorism."" The European Commission also condemned the violence and expressed concern about the possible evictions. ""Such actions are illegal under international humanitarian law and only serve to fuel tensions on the ground,"" said Peter Stano, EU Commission lead spokesperson for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, in a statement.  The United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said on May 7 that the law is ""applied in an inherently discriminatory manner,"" adding that the transfer of Israeli civilians onto occupied land could be ""prohibited under international humanitarian law and may amount to a war crime."" Why else have tensions escalated recently? The Sheikh Jarrah case is the flashpoint for tensions, but they quickly spread throughout the city and far beyond the confines of Jerusalem. The situation in Jerusalem can escalate in a hurry on its own, but the sensitivities in the city have been compounded by a combination of religious and nationalist factors. Two holidays fell on the same weekend this year: the Muslim Night of Power (Leylet el-Qadr) on the night of May 8, considered the holiest night of the year; and the Israeli holiday of Jerusalem Day (Yom Yerushalayim) on May 9-10, celebrating the day the Israeli military took control of the Old City in 1967.  Each holiday on its own can inspire religious and nationalist fervor, and together they are even more liable to ignite an already tense situation.  The political situation has not helped. Israel has had four inconclusive elections in a row, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has courted some openly extreme racist politicians as he struggles to build a coalition and stay in power. That has emboldened some far-right Jewish groups. Right-wing Israeli politicians Itamar Ben-Gvir and Arieh King came to Sheikh Jarrah to send a message that the entire city belongs to Israel. Their presence fanned the flames. The Palestinian political situation is hardly clearer than the Israeli one. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in April delayed the first parliamentary elections in 15 years, extending a long-running rivalry where his Fatah movement governs the West Bank, while Gaza is run by the militant Hamas, with Islamic Jihad also active there. Such is the power of Jerusalem. Protests in Jerusalem can ignite protests in Israel and the West Bank, as well as prompt militant groups in Gaza to fire rockets and the Israel Defense Forces to launch airstrikes. A situation that began in one neighborhood in Jerusalem has now spread across the area and brought international attention to Israel and the Palestinian territories once again.","{'neg': 0.184, 'neu': 0.816, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.4019}",73,168.0,0.188,0.812,0.0,-0.7579,0.095,0.826,0.079,-0.9819,-55.3267,-53.842074999999994,234.0,-0.2300943376068376
Biden faces an angry rift in his own party over Israeli-Palestinian conflict,2021-05-16,"So much attention has been focused on the rift in the GOP over former President Donald Trump's antidemocratic lies about the 2020 election. But Democrats have their own brewing disagreement over how the US should react to violence between Israelis and Palestinians, leading Democrats to question President Joe Biden's commitment to human rights and demanding he do more to pressure Israel.  It's an awkward public fight for a party that has made its commitment to social and racial justice a main part of its platform. As the US comes to grips with its own history of racism in new ways and adopts the Black Lives Matter movement in a mainstream way, liberals want to apply similar notions of justice to foreign policy, where an increasing number see apartheid in Israel's approach to the Palestinians. Vocal liberals have criticized the White House for placating Israel and ignoring human rights as violence mounts, as well as loudly criticizing Biden for not openly opposing Israel's planned evictions of Palestinian families from a neighborhood in east Jerusalem.  Biden spent much of Saturday preparing for and placing telephone calls to leaders in the region -- including his second call in a week to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his first phone call as president to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas -- suggesting deep engagement on the issue by Biden. He raised concerns about the safety of journalists after an Israeli airstrike razed a building in Gaza that housed the offices of the Associated Press. But liberals want more than engagement, they want him to call out Israel. Subtle shifts in language in readouts of the calls underscored the White House's new worries, but Biden has, in his public remarks at least, stayed deferential. ""One of the things that I have seen thus far is that there has not been a significant overreaction,"" the President said at the White House last week. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with Israeli Minister of Defense Benny Gantz Saturday. ""I reaffirmed Israel's right to defend itself and condemned Hamas' deliberate targeting of Israeli civilians,"" Austin said on Twitter. The intensifying violence in Israel has assumed new urgency at the White House, according to officials, as Biden and his aides are growing increasingly worried about the rising civilian death toll. Israeli airstrikes have killed more than 130 people and injured at least 1,000 others in Gaza alone, the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza said. Rioting and mob violence between Arabs and Jews marred cities and towns throughout Israel. Biden has spoken and been briefed by senior level aides, but, ultimately, officials acknowledge the President's ability to broker a ceasefire on his own is limited. Officials say as the violence between Israelis and Palestinians stretches into another week, he is keeping very close tabs on developing efforts by regional partners -- including Egypt and Qatar -- to broker a ceasefire. Officials said what happens over the next 72 hours will prove critical in terms of how and whether to ramp up pressure to end the hostilities. Liberals are fuming After Biden on Wednesday uttered the often-repeated mantra that Israel has a right to defend itself, liberals lashed out on the floor of the US House of Representatives.  ""Do Palestinians have a right to survive?"" asked New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in a fiery speech on Thursday. The progressive Democrat continued to speak out on Twitter this weekend, writing, ""If the Biden admin can't stand up to an ally, who can it stand up to? How can they credibly claim to stand for human rights?"" Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib responded on Saturday to the attack on the building housing international media. ""Israel targeting media sources is so the world can't see Israel's war crimes led by the apartheid-in-chief Netanyahu,"" she tweeted, referring to Netanyahu.  Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat who serves on the Foreign Relations Committee, has said the planned evictions violate international laws and all but questioned the administration's commitment to human rights. ""If the Biden Administration puts the rule of law and human rights at the heart of its foreign policy, this is not a moment for tepid statements,"" he tweeted earlier this month, linking to comments from the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who lost the Democratic presidential nomination to Biden, wrote an op-ed in the New York Times on Friday entitled, ""The U.S. Must Stop Being an Apologist for the Netanyahu Government."" The nation's largest Muslim civil rights group, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, joined a boycott of a virtual White House Eid celebration scheduled to take place Sunday. ""We cannot in good conscience celebrate Eid with the Biden Administration while it literally aids, abets and justifies the Israeli apartheid government's indiscriminate bombing of innocent men, women and children in Gaza,"" CAIR said in a statement that warned Biden he risks damaging his relationship with American Muslims.  Muslim rights groups had hailed Biden in the first days of his presidency for ending the Trump administration's ban on travel from predominantly Muslim countries. In a statement Friday casting forward to the White House's celebration of Eid, the Muslim religious festival, Biden tempered his comments from earlier in the week.  ""Palestinians -- including in Gaza -- and Israelis equally deserve to live in dignity, safety and security,"" he said, recognizing Palestinians without criticizing Israel. Liberal Democrats have long opposed US policy toward Israel and progressives have become more vocal calling for new tactics, like demanding policy changes in exchange for the large amounts of military aid the US provides. ""By continuing to provide military aid without restriction, we provide no incentive for Israel to adjust course,"" Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said in April, in remarks to the liberal pro-Israel group J Street. Sanders went further in the New York Times on Friday. ""In the Middle East, where we provide nearly $4 billion a year in aid to Israel, we can no longer be apologists for the right-wing Netanyahu government and its undemocratic and racist behavior. We must change course and adopt an evenhanded approach, one that upholds and strengthens international law regarding the protection of civilians, as well as existing U.S. law holding that the provision of U.S. military aid must not enable human rights abuses."" Not being Trump is not enough Biden's approach, while it leaves much for fellow Democrats to criticize, is a far cry from Trump's all-in for Israel approach, which he used to his political advantage with Christian voters. Trump moved the US embassy to Jerusalem, a controversial move that angered Palestinians. Biden chose not to move the embassy back. Netanyahu, who at the same time as this flareup has also been unable to form a new government and may see yet another general election as his best chance of staying in power, was a booster of Trump's Middle East policy and a chief international critic of the Iran nuclear deal, which Trump ended and Biden is trying to resurrect. Simply not being Trump represents a policy change in itself. ""We need to end this conflict,"" Rep. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat, told CNN Saturday, talking about the current violence. ""Thank God we have a responsible president now in the United States, who I think can press upon the Israeli leader the need to do that."" Sanders used the same language he might use to describe Trump to describe Netanyahu. ""Over more than a decade of his right-wing rule in Israel, Mr. Netanyahu has cultivated an increasingly intolerant and authoritarian type of racist nationalism,"" Sanders wrote, although he also criticized the Palestinian Authority as ""corrupt and ineffective."" ""With a new president, the United States now has the opportunity to develop a new approach to the world — one based on justice and democracy,"" Sanders wrote. This story has been updated with additional reporting.","{'neg': 0.324, 'neu': 0.52, 'pos': 0.156, 'compound': -0.4404}",49,169.0,0.06871428571428573,0.8754285714285714,0.056,-0.031666666666666655,0.129,0.775,0.096,-0.9964,-1.551666666666666,-38.63034166666666,265.0,-0.14577487421383645
"Israeli strikes hit home in Gaza refugee camp, media offices as conflict intensifies",2021-05-15,"Israel bombed a house in Gaza where a family had gathered to celebrate the end of Ramadan and an office housing international media as a new flurry of Hamas missiles rained down on Tel Aviv Saturday, increasing fears that a de-escalation of the conflict could soon be out of reach. The Jala'a building, which was hit by an Israeli airstrike on Saturday afternoon, contained offices for Al Jazeera and the Associated Press, among other media outlets, marking the latest escalation of violence that has spread across Israel and the Palestinian territories this week -- the conflict's bloodiest in recent years.  Israel launched more airstrikes on Gaza overnight, with Hamas retaliating with missiles on Saturday.  Early Sunday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had bombed the house of Hamas' Gaza leader, Yahya Sinwar. IDF spokesperson Brig. Gen. Hidai Zilberman told local media Sinwar was unhurt in an airstrike that hit his home in Khan Yunis, southern Gaza. Also Sunday morning, Israeli airstrikes on Gaza killed at least two Palestinians and injured 25 others, most of whom were women and children, the Palestinian Ministry of Health's spokesperson Ashraf al-Qudra said.  Medical and civil defense teams ""rescued five children alive from under the rubble"" and they are now at the hospital in stable condition, al-Qudra said. The numbers will likely rise as rescue operations continue, he added.  With the latest casualties, the death toll in Gaza has climbed to a total of 147, including at least 41 children and 23 women, according to CNN's count of data from the ministry. Since the beginning of the airstrikes on Gaza this week, 1,125 have been injured, the ministry data showed. Meanwhile, rioting and mob violence between Arabs and Jews marred cities and towns throughout Israel. Hamas fired dozens of missiles toward Tel Aviv and the city of Ashdod on Saturday, with Al-Qassam Brigades, the militant wing of Hamas, saying in statements the moves were in direct retaliation for Israeli airstrikes on a Gazan refugee camp, civilian towers and safe houses. A 50-year old man was killed early Saturday afternoon after a rocket hit a series of buildings in a residential area in a Tel Aviv suburb called Ramat Gan, bringing Israel's death toll to 10, according to Israel's emergency service.  Early Saturday, an infant was the lone survivor in a house that was hit and destroyed in an Israeli air strike hit in the al-Shati refugee camp, killing 10 members of the infant's family -- including eight children, according to the Palestinian News Agency WAFA. At least 20 other Palestinians were wounded after several nearby houses were damaged in the Israeli airstrike, it added. The IDF said its forces struck several positions in Gaza late Friday, including a military intelligence site. ""Hamas is paying the price for its terror,"" it said in a Twitter post on Saturday.  ""The Hamas terror organization deliberately uses Gazan civilians as a way to shield and cover its hostile operations. The IDF takes all possible precautions to avoid harming civilians during its operational activities."" IDF said in a statement released Saturday. Militants in Gaza responded to the airstrikes on the refugee camp on Saturday with rockets targeting the Israeli cities of Beersheba, Ashdod, and Sderot. The IDF posted a video on Twitter of a blazing fire in Ashdod, warning that the move ""won't go unanswered."" In a statement, UN Secretary General António Guterres said he was ""dismayed"" by the rising number of civilian casualties. ""The Secretary-General reminds all sides that any indiscriminate targeting of civilian and media structures violates international law and must be avoided at all costs,"" the statement said. On the Jala'a building strike, the Israeli Airforce said Saturday that fighter jets targeted a building which was housing Hamas military intelligence assets and using media outlets as ""shields."" The Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza, however has accused the IDF of ""direct targeting of crowded civilian areas"" and failing to take precautionary measures to spare civilian lives. In a statement Saturday, the Associated Press said that the news agency does not have any ""indication Hamas was in the building or active in the building"" where its bureau in Gaza was located. The Foreign Press Association and the Committee to Protect Journalists on Saturday condemned the Israeli strike on a Gaza building housing media outlets, including Al Jazeera and the Associated Press. ""It is utterly unacceptable for Israel to bomb and destroy the offices of media outlets and endanger the lives of journalists. Israeli authorities know where media outlets are housed,"" the CPJ said on Twitter.    CPJ Executive Director Joel Simon, said in a statement: ""We demand that the Israeli government provide a detailed and documented justification for this military attack on a civilian facility given the possible violation of international humanitarian law.""   With families living in temporary shelters after being evacuated or losing their homes, the Palestinian Health Ministry warned of an imminent ""health crisis"" that can increase the spread of coronavirus in Gaza.  The United Nations Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF), said in a statement on Saturday that ""children are bearing the brunt of this escalation"" in violence between Israel and the Palestinians. UNICEF's regional director for the Middle East and North Africa, Ted Chaiban, said ""all sides have an obligation to protect civilians -- especially children -- and facilitate humanitarian access."" Chaiban said eight Palestinian children were reported killed north of Gaza overnight. They ranged in age from six months to 17 years, with more than half under 10 years old, he said.  ""In Israel, two children, including a six-year-old, were killed since the escalation began,"" he said. Ashraf al-Qudra, the spokesman for Gaza health ministry, urged ""the international community of the necessity to curb the Israeli aggression on the Gaza Strip,"" adding that ""we monitor these violations against Palestinian families, and this is a blatant violation."" US President Joe Biden on Saturday spoke with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Biden ""raised concerns about the safety and security of journalists and reinforced the need to ensure their protection"" according to a readout of the call released by the White House. While President Biden again ""reaffirmed his strong support for Israel's right to defend itself against rocket attacks from Hamas,"" he also expressed his concern for the Palestinian people. A readout of the call from Netanyahu's office said the prime minister ""updated the President on developments and action that Israel has taken and still intends to carry out"" and thanked Biden ""for the unwavering support of USA in our right to defend ourselves."" Netanyahu said that ""Israel does all it can to avoid hitting innocent parties,""  adding that ""the proof of which is that innocent parties are evacuated from high-rise buildings where there is a terrorist target attacked by IDF."" President Biden also spoke with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Saturday.  In a readout after a phone call with Biden, Abbas called on the American President to intervene in putting an end to ""Israeli attack on Palestinian people everywhere,"" an official statement by the Palestinian Authority said on Saturday.  President Abbas also said that he is ready to work with the American administration to ""strengthen bilateral relations and remove any obstacles standing in their way.""  The Palestinian statement said that ""President Biden stressed the commitment of the United States to the two-state solution, and the importance of giving hope to the Palestinian people to achieve peace.""   Defense Minister Benny Gantz said in a tweet on Saturday that ""Israel has no interest in escalation, but is ready for any scenario."" ""We have charged a very heavy price from Hamas in the last day -- and we have more plans in line,"" he added.    Posting a photo of him speaking to Israeli commanders, Gantz warned that ""if terrorism raises its head -- we will lower it.""  The Biden administration, which has said its focus is on de-escalation and working with allies in the region on that goal, sent US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Israel and Palestinian Affairs Hady Amr to Israel on Friday. The US Embassy in Jerusalem said in a post on Twitter that Amr's trip would ""reinforce the need to work toward a sustainable calm, recognizing Israel's right to self-defense. Israelis and Palestinians deserve equal measures of freedom, security, dignity and prosperity.""  But efforts at international diplomacy so far appear to have stalled. A UN Security Council meeting on the violence will take place Sunday morning; the US blocked previous Security Council efforts to meet, preferring direct diplomacy on the conflict rather than discussion in an international forum. An Israeli military official said on Friday that Israel is prepared to continue hitting ""quality targets"" for an ""extended period of time."" Approximately 2,300 rockets have been fired from Gaza towards Israel, of which approximately 380 failed launches fell in Gaza, the IDF said on Saturday, adding that their Iron Dome Aerial Defense System has intercepted approximately 1,000 rockets. Following the strike on the Jala'a building Saturday, the Al-Qassam Brigades spokesperson said: ""After the strike on the civilian tower in Gaza, the residents of Tel Aviv and central Israel should be prepared for our quaking response."" And that violence has boiled over to the occupied West Bank, where on Friday, at least 10 Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces during violent clashes in towns and cities across the territory, according to the Gaza-based Palestinian Health Ministry.  The violence there marks the largest number of people killed in a single day in the West Bank in years. The Palestinian Red Crescent said Palestinians in the West Bank had been targeted with live ammunition, as well as rubber bullets and teargas. According to the Palestinian Health Ministry, the majority of those who were injured on Friday were ""shot by live ammunition,"" saying that more than 500 Palestinians have been injured since clashes erupted earlier this week. An IDF spokesman said in a statement live ammunition was used after ""crowd dispersal means"" (referring to tear gas and rubber-coated bullets) had failed to stop the unrest. The recent conflict began at the start of the week, fueled by controversy over planned evictions of Palestinian families in East Jerusalem and restrictions at a popular meeting point near the Old City. It has since escalated rapidly into one of the worst rounds of violence the area has seen since the 2014 Gaza War, which saw more than 2,200 Gazans killed during the fighting, approximately half of them civilians, including more than 550 children, according to a ","{'neg': 0.304, 'neu': 0.696, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.5859}",66,170.0,0.06966666666666667,0.8376666666666667,0.09266666666666667,0.07705000000000001,0.118,0.823,0.059,-0.999,5.0853,-39.38326666666666,274.0,-0.14373454987834547
Multiple crises at home and abroad provide a reality check for Biden's White House,2021-05-15,"President Joe Biden was at the wooded Camp David retreat in Maryland when he first heard Colonial Pipeline had been hacked.  Briefed in one of the mountainside lodges by senior advisers and aides from the National Security Council, Biden quickly realized the incident -- and subsequent shutdown of the company's pipeline supplying fuel to the Eastern Seaboard -- could easily devolve into a major problem. Long lines of cars at pumps and handwritten ""no fuel"" signs make for potent political imagery, a fact Biden experienced firsthand when as a young senator he saw an oil crisis help deprive President Jimmy Carter of a second term. The pipeline shutdown was the first in a string of unexpected events in the past week that have tested the President and his aides. A day later, violence would begin rapidly escalating between Israelis and Palestinians, lighting up telephone lines between Washington and the Middle East and thrusting Biden back into a conflict riddled with failed US efforts at brokering peace. Alarm bells for the still-recovering economy began ringing in new inflation numbers midweek, setting up fresh political hurdles just as Biden was entering a critical stretch of negotiations with Republicans over his $4 trillion in new spending. Before the pipeline shutdown, aides said the President had been planning to spend the weekend getting updates from advisers on the labor market -- including on why the jobs report the previous Friday proved so disappointing. Thursday brought a more welcome surprise, albeit one that still caused a scramble. The timing of new mask guidelines for vaccinated Americans from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention caught some aides off guard and have prompted a confusing rush in states to update their rules. White House officials had been anticipating the CDC would soon make changes, but many believed it would take the notoriously slow-moving agency until later this month to decide on the new recommendations. Until now, Biden had mostly been spared the types of quickly spiraling foreign crises or surprise domestic emergencies that compose any presidency. His plate has instead been filled with longer-term issues -- like recovering from the pandemic -- or tenacious problems, like a surge of migrants at the Southwestern border.  But the past week amounted to a reality check for a President who has placed nearly all of his political capital in ending the pandemic and enacting a boldly progressive agenda, having spent months focused on getting shots in arms and stimulus checks in Americans' bank accounts. The simultaneous foreign and domestic crises would challenge even the most seasoned president, let alone one charged with navigating the country from its worst health crisis in a century. They serve as a reminder that any manner of crises can intervene to throw the trajectory off course. 'You have to be prepared' Publicly, the White House assumed a calm demeanor toward the developments, even as concerns about the potential political fallout pervaded. Aides said Biden is no stranger to surprises, having witnessed and responded to them for eight years as vice president. ""That's what we're made for here,"" press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday.  ""We certainly know that -- and the President knew from having served as vice president for eight years -- that when you walk in and you're the leader of the free world and you're overseeing a country that is still working its way through a pandemic and an economic recovery, that you have to be prepared to juggle multiple challenges, multiple crises at one time,"" she said. An energy crunch is near the top of that list. Aside from watching Carter struggle to contain a nationwide gas shortage in 1979, Biden saw firsthand how President Barack Obama strove to manage the political fallout from the BP oil spill in the early days of his presidency. After his initial briefing on the hack last Saturday at Camp David, Biden asked for updates every day by members of his staff. The White House's concern over the issue was plain as Cabinet secretaries came to cameras each afternoon with new measures they were taking to alleviate shortages. Republicans seized the opportunity to compare Biden to Carter, even though the pipeline shutdown was prompted by Russia-based ransomware hackers who penetrated a weak private-sector network. Biden himself chose to deliver an update Thursday once the pipeline was back online.   ""This is a whole-of-government response to get more fuel more quickly to where it's needed and to limit the pain being felt by American customers,"" he said from the Roosevelt Room, taking credit for ""extraordinary measures"" that would provide enough gas to fill the tanks of 5 million vehicles. Yet the question of the nation's cybersecurity remained, and Biden suggested Thursday that he wasn't ruling out a counterattack on the criminal syndicate responsible for the Colonial Pipeline hack, saying, ""We're also going to pursue a measure to disrupt their ability to operate."" By Friday, the ransomware extortion website used by the group responsible for the cyberattack had gone offline, according to cybersecurity experts. The President said he'd raise the issue with Russian President Vladimir Putin at their upcoming summit, expected next month when Biden visits Europe on his first foreign trip.  Attention turns back to the Middle East The episode seemed to confirm Biden's belief that areas like cybersecurity, Russia and China present today's most serious foreign threats. Yet an urgent foreign crisis in the Middle East has occupied much of the national security attention at the White House this week. As some of the worst violence in years broke out between Israelis and Palestinians, the region's long-entrenched battles are dragging Biden back in.  A US official told CNN that the President on Saturday spoke with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas -- the first conversation between the two leaders since Biden assumed the presidency. Biden also spoke Saturday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the official said. Those conversations come amid the heightened concern about civilian causalities in Gaza.   Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin also spoke with Israeli Minister of Defense Benny Gantz Saturday, with Austin tweeting about the conversation, ""I reaffirmed Israel's right to defend itself and condemned Hamas' deliberate targeting of Israeli civilians."" A White House official told CNN earlier in the day that internal meetings would be held Saturday on the escalating violence, as well as on the administration's infrastructure push.  The President had also spoken with Netanyahu on Wednesday. At the State Department, the Pentagon and the office suite of the National Security Council, a flurry of telephone calls had gone out to Israeli and Palestinian leaders, along with officials in Egypt and Qatar who the US hopes can help broker a ceasefire. It's not necessarily the foreign policy issue Biden wanted to be confronting in the early months of his presidency. Amid the chaos, he spoke publicly about the violence only when questioned by reporters. Officials said they believe the President can play a more productive role in private discussions, including with Netanyahu, than in making proactive public statements. Officials are also mindful of the delicate -- and somewhat new -- political pressures Biden is facing on the matter. Though he has been versed on this issue for decades as a lawmaker leading the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and later as vice president, a growing strain of Democratic politics has been harshly critical of Israel's actions. Even his boilerplate statement that Israel has a right to defend itself invited a rebuke from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who said ""blanket statements"" like Biden's ""dehumanize Palestinians & imply the US will look the other way at human rights violations."" Biden and the White House have shown little willingness to bend to that pressure. Speaking the next day at the White House, the President said he did not detect a disproportionate response to Hamas' rocket attacks from Israel, which has launched airstrikes in Gaza. And over the course of the week, he focused far more public attention on domestic matters, including the still-fragile economy. After the badly disappointing jobs report last week and midweek numbers showing a spike in inflation, Biden and his aides have tried to explain that the economy is still in the unpredictable early stages of recovery. ""We are in the midst of restarting this economy in earnest, and we are making good progress in doing so. However, we must keep in mind that an economy will not heal instantaneously,"" said Cecilia Rouse, chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, on Friday. The White House downplayed inflation concerns by saying the new data reflects pent-up consumer demand that some suppliers cannot immediately meet. But even leading Democratic economist Larry Summers used the troubling numbers to urge the White House to shift course from distributing Covid relief funds, which he blames for increased spending and inflation. ""Policymakers at the Fed and in the (White House) need to recognize that the risk of a Vietnam inflation scenario is now greater than the deflation risks on which they were originally focused,"" Summers told CNN's John Harwood. Mask guidance catches White House off guard Given the spate of unwelcome developments that had percolated in the days leading up to it, the CDC announcement Thursday made for a welcome -- if still unplanned-for -- development. Biden's senior aides received word at 9 p.m. ET on Wednesday that the guidance was changing, and word did not spread widely in the West Wing until later the following day. Biden himself was sitting in his office with a group of Republicans when the rules officially changed. When aides told the group the rules had changed, he didn't waste a moment in peeling off his mask. ""We heard all about it,"" Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, the West Virginian charged with negotiating a bipartisan infrastructure package with Biden, said afterward. ""The President took his off."" Outside the windows, aides were rushing to prepare the Rose Garden for a statement. A few hundred miles away, his wife saw the news aboard her airplane. ""We feel naked!"" she exclaimed at a school in West Virginia, where she emerged for one of the first times without her face covered. Some White House officials said they had not anticipated how far-reaching the guidance would be, given the CDC's cautious track record. And some state officials said they disagreed with it. ""I have concerns about pulling back on some of the recommendations at this time,"" said Dr. Benjamin Chan, New Hampshire state epidemiologist. ""To be honest, I'm a little bit unhappy with how CDC rolled out their guidance."" Biden, meanwhile, used his hastily arranged Rose G","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",69,171.0,0.0,0.934,0.066,0.6369,0.092,0.827,0.08,-0.9875,43.9461,-7.84696666666666,304.0,-0.02581239035087717
"At least 10 Palestinians killed by Israeli soldiers in violent confrontations in West Bank, as Gaza rocket fire enters fifth day",2021-05-14,"At least 10 Palestinians were killed Friday by Israeli forces during violent clashes in towns and cities across the West Bank, the Gaza-based Palestinian Health Ministry said in a statement, as sirens continued to blare all day across southern Israel, indicating another day of ceaseless rocket fire from Gaza.  The violence in the occupied West Bank marks the largest number of people killed in a single day there for years.  The Palestinian Red Crescent said Palestinians had been targeted with live ammunition, as well as rubber bullets and teargas. Israel has continued this week a bombing operation the government says is targeting Palestinian militants in Gaza, which has killed at least 126 people, including at least 31 children and 20 women, the Palestinian Health Ministry reported Friday. At least 950 people, including at least 254 children, have sustained injuries as a result of Israeli airstrikes, the Health Ministry added. According to the Palestinian Health Ministry, more than 500 Palestinians have been injured since clashes erupted earlier this week. The majority of those injured on Friday were ""shot by live ammunition,"" the Health Ministry added.  A spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement live ammunition was used after ""crowd dispersal means"" (referring to tear gas and rubber-coated bullets) had failed to stop the unrest.   The IDF estimated about 5,000 people had been involved in what it called riots across the West Bank, with participants throwing stones and incendiary devices at soldiers and military positions. Speaking to a CNN team in Bethlehem, protesters said they will continue to demonstrate in solidarity with Palestinian families facing forced eviction in the neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah in Jerusalem, as well as those coming under Israeli bombardment in Gaza. ""We are doing this to show we stand with Gaza and our brothers in Jerusalem and [our brothers] inside Israel,"" one protester who refused to give his name told CNN.  Inter-community violence Conflict between Israelis and Palestinians boiled over at the start of the week, fueled by controversy over planned evictions of Palestinian families in East Jerusalem and restrictions at a popular meeting point near the Old City as Ramadan began. It has since escalated rapidly into one of the worst rounds of violence between the two sides in the last several years.  Rioting and violent clashes between Arab and Jewish citizens swept across several Israeli cities this week -- among them Lod, Bat Yam and Acre -- leading Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to warn against ""lynching"" by either community.  Protests and demonstrations continued after Muslim Friday prayers at noon local time. Palestinian protesters also marched in the West Bank cities of Nablus, Qalqilya, Tulkarm, Jenin and Hebron early Friday morning, the Red Crescent said, in a continuation of weeks-long demonstrations.   One Palestinian man was shot and killed by Israeli forces close to the West Bank's Ofra settlement after trying to stab a soldier with a screwdriver at a checkpoint, the Israeli military said. The soldier was unharmed.  One Israeli woman died overnight Thursday into Friday after she fell as she was running to a shelter, the Israeli military said Friday, making her the eighth Israeli to die since the IDF and Palestinian militants began exchanging fire on Monday.  According to the IDF, more than 160 Israeli Air Force, infantry, artillery and armored units from 12 different squadrons attacked about 150 targets in underground infrastructure in northern Gaza overnight Thursday into Friday. A fifth day of fighting In a briefing with journalists later Friday, an Israeli military official said more than 2,000 rockets had been fired toward Israel from Gaza since Monday, adding that Israel is prepared to continue hitting ""quality targets"" for an ""extended period of time."" The IDF said the operation has been focusing on dismantling an underground network of tunnels where Hamas houses its strike capabilities and shelters its senior members. The military assessment is that while they have been successful in targeting Hamas, the militant group maintains a sizeable amount of rockets.  ""We've been able to strike a lot of the manufacturing and storage facilities. But the assessment is they still have a sizable amount of rockets left,"" the official said.  ""In terms of personnel we have successfully targeted dozens of senior Hamas and Islamic jihad leaders and according to our assessment that has caused a sense among the senior leaders that they are being hunted,"" the official said.    At least 75 militants have been killed since Monday, the official said, but added the numbers are a conservative estimate.   However, the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza has accused the IDF of ""direct targeting of crowded civilian areas"" and failing to take precautionary measures to spare civilian lives, charges the IDF strongly rejects.  UN Deputy Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process Lynn Hastings told CNN on Friday that approximately 10,000 people had now been displaced within Gaza.   ""We're seeing a lot of these people coming to the UN agency in Gaza that deals with refugees, which means they are now in schools... they're being sheltered there,"" Hastings said. UN Secretary-General António Guterres called for all sides to stop fighting in Gaza and Israel and allow for mediation efforts to ""intensify with a view to ending the fighting immediately,"" UN spokesman Stéphane Dujarric said Friday.  White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the administration's focus is on de-escalation and working with allies in the region on that goal.  Efforts at international diplomacy so far appear to have stalled. A UN Security Council meeting on the violence will take place Sunday morning; the US blocked previous Security Council efforts to meet, preferring direct diplomacy on the conflict rather than discussion in an international forum.  'We lost everything' A CNN producer inside Gaza reported heavy incoming artillery fire from Israeli ground forces near the border as well as dozens of airstrikes.  CNN also spoke by phone Friday with Tariq Al Hillo, 27, from Beit Lahia in Gaza, who described a ""terrifying"" scene overnight as the buildings around his own block -- which is home to six families -- were destroyed. ""I can't even describe it, I don't know where to start and I'm losing my sanity,"" he told CNN. ""All the buildings around us were totally destroyed yesterday, we saw shreds everywhere. I can still see them until now, I can still hear women screaming and men crying loudly.""  People believed they would be killed at any moment, he said. ""We lost everything around us and we lost safety. I have five sisters, three of them are children between 10 and 15 years old, they were shaking and looking around them traumatized and waiting for their turn to come under the rubble.""  At 2 a.m., he decided they should leave the house to walk to a relatives' home five or six miles away, Hillo said. ""I was not afraid to die, but I was afraid that one of my family members would,"" he said. ""On our way I was telling my sisters to calm down and that nothing will happen to us, but I was shaking and couldn't even walk because I was terrified.""  Clashes on Jordan-Israeli border Meanwhile, Jordanian authorities dispersed protesters charging towards the border with Israel in the Jordan Valley, a statement released by the Jordanian Public Security Department said.  Hundreds of people had gathered near the King Hussein bridge crossing from Jordan into Israel, in the Jordan Valley, to protest Israeli air strikes on Gaza and current measures against Palestinians in Jerusalem, according to Jordanian public broadcaster, Al Mamlaka TV.  Videos from the scene show Jordanian forces firing tear gas to disperse the crowds, after a number of protesters charged towards the border despite authority warnings not to leave the protest venue. The Jordanian Public Security Department said police used ""proportionate force.""  Over the past few days, protesters have been marching in Jordan against Israeli strikes in Gaza.

Whatever happened to Jared Kushner's peace plan?,2021-05-14,"Last year, former President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu unveiled their peace plan for the Middle East at the White House. Now, 16 months later, the question that begs to be asked is whether that plan has worked at all.  Initially, of course, it seemed like a colossal success. Though Palestinian representatives rejected the entire plan from the outset and refused to be involved in any aspect of its creation, two of Israel's longest-standing foes in the region, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, followed by Morocco and Sudan, reversed generations of hostility, opened diplomatic relations and eventually allowed commercial air flights.  Yet, from the get-go, there were some ominous signs. The plan, in what has become known as Jared Kushner's Vision for Peace -- a tribute to the efforts by the former President's son-in-law -- spelled out in a detailed map for Israel to halt expansion of any new settlement activity on a large swath of the West Bank without American consent, which Kushner affirmed would not be given ""for some time."" (However, the plan did allow Israel to annex its existing West Bank settlements -- in violation of international law.) Indeed, a series of ""talking points,"" which Kushner and the State Department cabled to all American embassies, and which Politico obtained and published, claimed that ""Israel has agreed to comport its policies to this Vision for at least four years, including freezing all settlement activity in the West Bank in areas that this Vision designates for the future State of Palestine."" Sadly, Netanyahu, who is now facing prospects for a fifth election in two years after failing to form a government, has respected little of this. Settlement creep has continued. A joint statement earlier this month from five European countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Britain) urged a halt to the expansion of 540 new homes in the West Bank, and asked Israel ""to cease its policy of settlement expansion across the Occupied Palestinian Territories.""  Accompanying these provocative actions, frictions with the Palestinians have only intensified, leading now to what threatens to become an all-out war. The direct trigger for the violent exchanges appears to be the actions of Israeli police who fired stun grenades inside the Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, one of the city's holiest sites, on Monday. At the same time, Israeli police also were clashing with Palestinians over the eviction of several Palestinian families in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood of Jerusalem. While the attack on the sacred mosque and the evictions in Jerusalem may have been the more immediate triggers, the all but unchecked expansion of the settlements provided an atmosphere that was a toxic undercurrent.  President Joe Biden's administration has said little about the Vision for Peace, although Kushner himself, in a Wall Street Journal op-ed in March, described the persistent Arab-Israeli conflict as ""nothing more than a real-estate dispute between Israelis and Palestinians that need not hold up Israel's relations with the broader Arab world."" And, turning to suggestions on how Biden might proceed, elaborated: ""The table is set. If it is smart, the Biden administration will seize this historic opportunity to unleash the Middle East's potential, keep America safe, and help the region turn the page on a generation of conflict and instability."" Unfortunately, it is precisely some of these real estate actions that have poisoned the always fraught atmosphere between Palestinians and Israelis. The only real hope in the near-term is for veteran Middle East specialist Hady Amr, the special envoy dispatched this week to Israel by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, to find a way of returning Israel to a position of paying more than lip-service to key elements of the Kushner proposal. In dispatching him,Blinken pointed out that Amr ""will urge on my behalf and on behalf of President Biden a de-escalation of violence. We are very focused on this."" Then, however, he added that ""the United States remains committed to a two-state solution. This violence takes us further away from that goal."" A two-state solution means that Palestinians will ultimately receive their own homeland in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, removing them from Israeli control. The alternative would mean a single nation of Israel that includes Palestinian Arabs as citizens. Demographic trends, however, suggest that eventually, Palestinians could become a majority, placing the Jewish state in a position not unlike that of South Africa under apartheid -- a minority group ruling a hostile and growing majority. And settlement creep threatens to shrink Palestinian territories bit by bit, leading to a toxic and potentially irrevocable status quo. For the moment, beyond the violence that is paralyzing Israel and Gaza, I am also holding my breath as to what the UAE, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan might do. While there are considerable commercial advantages -- especially in terms of trade and tourism -- to them maintaining their ties, Israel's actions in the West Bank and now in daily strikes on Gaza (in response to daily Hamas rocket attacks into Israel) may prove too costly.  Hopefully, the situation can be stabilized before any such irrevocable actions take place. I confess, I have a personal stake in this. My dear niece and her husband are planning to emigrate to Israel in the next month, and their baby will be born there. My prayer is that they will not be forced to arrive in a nation in flames. It is incumbent on the Netanyahu government to demonstrate its willingness to adhere to critical international agreements, particularly on halting the expansion of Israeli settlements on Palestinian lands. Such a show of goodwill can only be constructive, even if it does remove some of the ultra-Orthodox who oppose such moves from Netanyahu's coalition and complicates his efforts to retain hold on power.  Any number of American Presidents have played key roles in bringing, if not peace, at least a degree of stability to the Holy Land. Now it may be time for Biden to bring his good offices to bear. It is a complicated equation, certainly. Netanyahu and Biden are clearly at odds over some central issues in the region, especially the President's goal of resuscitating the Iranian nuclear accord, which the Israeli leader finds anathema. But a determined gesture, more than simply a shrug, may be necessary on the part of Netanyahu if Israelis and Palestinians are not to spiral deeply into more destructive violence.

Israel launches more strikes on Gaza as fears of a ground invasion grow,2021-05-14,"The Israeli military directed heavy artillery fire and dozens of airstrikes into Gaza overnight into Friday, as fears grew that a ground invasion of the territory could be launched to quell rocket fire from Palestinian militants. As the Israeli bombardment rained down, United Nations officials inside Gaza said dozens of people had fled their homes in the north and east of the enclave to seek refuge in schools -- belonging to the UN relief agency for Palestinian refugees -- which are considered designated emergency shelters. Just a few kilometers away, residents in the Israeli town of Ashkelon were fleeing to their bomb shelters again, as sirens wailed warning of a fresh barrage of rockets fired by Palestinian militants from Gaza. One Israeli woman died overnight after she fell as she was running to a shelter, the Israeli military said Friday, making her the eighth Israeli to die since the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Palestinian militants began exchanging fire on Monday. Israel's bombing campaign in Gaza has now killed at least 119 people, including 31 children and 19 women, the Gaza-based Palestinian Health Ministry reported Friday. At least 830 people have sustained injuries as a result of Israeli airstrikes this week, the Health Ministry added. Power went off across much of Gaza overnight as a result of the Israeli bombardment, a correspondent for Palestinian news agency WAFA reported. The Gaza Electricity Distribution Company said there had been serious damage to electricity networks in northern Gaza, as well as in parts of Gaza City and elsewhere. A CNN producer inside Gaza reported heavy incoming artillery fire from Israeli ground forces near the border as well as dozens of airstrikes. CNN also spoke by phone Friday with Tariq Al Hillo, 27, from Beit Lahia in Gaza, who described a ""terrifying"" scene overnight as the buildings around his own block -- which is home to six families -- were destroyed. ""I can't even describe it, I don't know where to start and I'm losing my sanity,"" he told CNN. ""All the buildings around us were totally destroyed yesterday, we saw shreds everywhere.

At 2 a.m., he decided they should leave the house to walk to a relatives' home five or six miles away, Hillo said. ""I was not afraid to die but I was afraid that one of my family members would,"" he said. ""On our way I was telling my sisters to calm down and that nothing will happen to us, but I was shaking and couldn't even walk because I was terrified."" On Thursday, Israel's Defense Minister Benny Gantz warned that Israel has ""many, many more targets"" and no time limit on its military operations against Gaza. Israel has called up 7,000 army reservists so far, he added. Most analysts believe that the current build-up of a single division's worth of armor and infantry is not sufficient to conduct such a major incursion. Amid the intense Israeli artillery fire into Gaza early Friday, there were reports -- later conclusively denied -- that the Israeli army had launched a possible ground invasion of the territory. An army tweet, which said simply ""IDF air and ground troops are currently attacking in the Gaza Strip"" -- which coincided with the start of a sustained new round of artillery and airstrikes -- led many news organizations to report that a ground war, much-discussed in Israeli media on Thursday, was underway. A clarification came about an hour or so later. ""There are currently no IDF ground troops inside the Gaza Strip,"" IDF spokesman Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus told CNN early Friday local time. IDF chief spokesman Hidai Zilberman had confirmed to Israel Channel 12 News on Thursday that Israel was amassing troops on the border with Gaza in case of a decision by leadership for a ground incursion, but said it would take time. ""With the enemy waving a land campaign, we say: any ground incursion into any area of the Gaza Strip would, by God's permission, be an opportunity to increase our yield of enemy dead and enemy prisoners,"" the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, said in a statement on Thursday. Tunnel network targeted At a media briefing Friday, Conricus said the Israeli military was prepared for ""various contingencies"" and would continue firing on military targets in Gaza while defending Israeli civilians against rockets. Palestinian militants have fired 1,800 rockets toward Israel since Monday, according to the IDF, of which 430 fell short. Of those, 190 were fired between 7 p.m. Thursday and Friday morning, 30 of them falling short. Overnight Thursday into Friday, more than 160 Israeli Air Force, infantry, artillery and armored units from 12 different squadrons attacked about 150 targets in underground infrastructure in northern Gaza, the IDF said. ""Many kilometers"" of the Hamas 'Metro' tunnel network were believed to have been damaged but the exact impact was still being assessed, Conricus said. Conricus said the number of ""enemy combatants"" killed was still being assessed but had ""risen significantly"" since the last update, when the number stood at more than 30. Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system also intercepted another drone launched from Gaza -- the second so far, the IDF said. Inter-community violence Conflict between Israelis and Palestinians boiled over at the start of the week, fueled by controversy over planned evictions of Palestinian families in Jerusalem and restrictions at a popular East Jerusalem meeting point as Ramadan began. It has since escalated rapidly into one of the worst rounds of violence between the two sides in the last several years. Rioting and violent clashes between Arab and Jewish citizens have swept across several Israeli cities this week, leading Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to warn against ""lynching"" by either community. In Bat Yam, south of Jaffa, graphic video Wednesday night showed a Jewish right-wing mob trying to lynch an Arab driver. Police say the man was dragged from his car before the assault began. In Acre, north of Haifa, a lynching attempt by an Arab mob left a Jewish man critically wounded, according to Israeli police. A police spokesman said the mob attacked police officers with stones before attacking the victim with stones and iron bars. Communal violence was also reported in the Israeli cities of Lod, Tiberias, Umm al-Fahm and Hadera. Efforts at international diplomacy so far appear to have stalled. A UN Security Council meeting on the violence will take place Sunday morning; the US blocked previous Security Council efforts to meet, preferring direct diplomacy on the conflict rather than discussion in an international forum.","{'neg': 0.359, 'neu': 0.641, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.6801}",44,174.0,0.159,0.841,0.0,-0.6486,0.153,0.809,0.038,-0.9994,-28.5384,-11.428599999999989,270.0,-0.04232814814814811

White House not bending to pressure from progressives to condemn Israel,2021-05-14,"President Joe Biden and the White House are showing little willingness to bend to pressure from liberal Democrats calling for more robust condemnation of Israel's actions amid the worst regional violence in years. Speaking at the White House, Biden said he did not detect a disproportionate response to Hamas' rocket attacks from Israel, which has launched airstrikes in Gaza that have so far killed at least 87 people, including 18 children and eight women, according to the Gaza-based Palestinian Health Ministry. Later, press secretary Jen Psaki declined to say whether Biden pressed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the growing Palestinian civilian death toll in a telephone conversation on Wednesday. ""In our view, attacks from Hamas into civilian neighborhoods is not self defense, so he certainly reiterated that, but also reiterated the need to move to de-escalate the situation on the ground,"" she said. Behind the scenes, officials have been more forceful with their Israeli counterparts, including urging against evicting Palestinians from their homes in East Jerusalem, according to officials familiar with the matter. And a readout of Biden's phone call with Netanyahu said he ""shared his conviction that Jerusalem, a city of such importance to people of faith from around the world, must be a place of peace."" But in his public statements on the crisis, Biden has hewed toward staunch support for Israel, despite calls from within his own party to adopt a tougher stance. ""One of the things that I have seen, thus far, is that there has not been a significant overreaction. The question is, how we get to a point where -- they get to a point where there is a significant reduction in the attacks, particularly the rocket attacks that are indiscriminately fired into population centers,"" Biden said at the White House when asked whether Netanyahu is doing enough to stop violence from escalating.  His answer reflected the longstanding view of both Republicans and Democrats that Israel has a right to defend itself against attacks from Hamas, which the US considers a terror organization. A day earlier, Biden told reporters Israel ""has a right to defend itself when you have thousands of rockets flying into your territory."" Biden has only spoken publicly about the increasing Middle East violence when questioned at the end of events. Officials said they believe he can play a more productive role in private discussions, including with Netanyahu, than in making public statements. But officials are also mindful of the delicate -- and somewhat new -- political pressures Biden is facing on the matter. Though he has been versed in this issue for decades as a senator leading the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and later as vice president, a growing strain of Democratic politics has been harshly critical of Israel's actions. After Biden said Wednesday that Israel has a right to defend itself -- without mentioning anything about the Palestinians -- progressive Democrats pounced. ""Blanket statements like these w/ little context or acknowledgement of what precipitated this cycle of violence - namely, the expulsions of Palestinians and attacks on Al Aqsa - dehumanize Palestinians & imply the US will look the other way at human rights violations. It's wrong,"" wrote Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York on Twitter. Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, responding to the White House's readout of Biden's telephone call with Netanyahu, decried its lack of mention of Israel's treatment of Palestinians. ""No mention of Sheikh Jarra. No mention of the al-Aqsa raid,"" she wrote, referring to recent incidents in Jerusalem, including the planned evictions. ""No mention of the 13 innocent children killed in air strikes. No mention of the ongoing occupation of millions in an open air prison."" ""You aren't prioritizing human rights. You're siding with an oppressive occupation,"" she wrote. Psaki, questioned about those statements, said Thursday the US was opposed to any civilian deaths. ""Let me be very clear: it is a tragedy for the loss of any life -- civilian, a child -- and we've certainly seen that as this violence has escalated. Our objective and our approach is to work with leaders in the region, whether they're the Israelis or the Palestinians, or leaders from other countries who can play an integral role in influencing Hamas, to de-escalate and move toward a more stable peace,"" she said. As Hamas continues sending a barrage of rockets into Israel, and Israel pounds Gaza with airstrikes, the White House is closely watching nascent ceasefire negotiations led by Egypt to bring an end to the violence, according to senior US officials, even as the outcome of those talks remains unclear. On Wednesday, Biden said he believed the crisis would not be prolonged after his conversation with Netanyahu. But he did not say what role the US would play in bringing it to an end. Officials said part of his optimism has been rooted in the conversations American officials have been having with allies in the region, including Egypt and Qatar, who have relations with Hamas and could help strike a deal to end the bombardments. His national security adviser Jake Sullivan has spoken to officials from both countries over the past two days. The White House efforts at engaging with the Palestinians to stem the violence are limited. Administration officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, have spoken to President Mahmoud Abbas. He has little control over Hamas or Gaza and there is an inherent limit to the amount of influence the US can exert on the situation because the US does not engage with Hamas, which the nation labels a terror organization. Instead, officials say telephone lines at the White House and State Department have been blinking non-stop since the violence began over the weekend with calls to other regional players. The White House said Wednesday there had been more than 25 calls and meetings among senior US officials and regional counterparts. Encouraging and monitoring those efforts is one of the primary current objectives of the White House amid the crisis, officials said. ""What our objective is in the short term is that Egypt, Tunisia, other important countries in the region certainly can play a role in conveying to Hamas and leaders of Hamas the reasons for de-escalation, and how that could be beneficial. And that's a role they have played historically, at moments in time,"" Psaki said on Thursday.","{'neg': 0.193, 'neu': 0.667, 'pos': 0.14, 'compound': -0.1808}",41,176.0,0.10983333333333334,0.8235,0.06666666666666667,-0.20943333333333333,0.146,0.774,0.08,-0.9982,-8.586766666666666,-71.75336666666666,179.0,-0.40085679702048416
Heavy artillery fire on Gaza escalates violence as clashes between Arabs and Jews rock Israeli cities,2021-05-13,"Gaza came under heavy artillery fire early Friday morning, amid reports -- later conclusively denied -- that the Israeli army had launched a possible ground invasion of the Strip. An army tweet, which said simply ""IDF air and ground troops are currently attacking in the Gaza Strip"" -- which coincided with the start of a sustained new round of artillery and airstrikes -- led many news organizations to report that a ground war, much-discussed in Israeli media on Thursday, was underway. A clarification came about an hour or so later. ""There are currently no IDF ground troops inside the Gaza Strip,"" army spokesman Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus told CNN early Friday local time.   A CNN producer inside Gaza reported heavy incoming artillery fire from Israeli forces as well as dozens of airstrikes.  United Nations officials inside Gaza said dozens of people had fled their homes in the north and east of the enclave to seek refuge in schools -- belonging to the United Nations relief agency for Palestinian refugees -- which are considered designated emergency shelters. Just a few kilometers away, residents in the Israeli town of Ashkelon were fleeing to their bomb shelters again, as sirens wailed warning of a fresh barrage of rockets. Earlier in the day, Israel's Defense Minister Benny Gantz warned that Israel has ""many, many more targets"" and no time limit on its military operations against Gaza, as the Israeli military and Palestinian militants continued to exchange deadly airstrikes and rocket bombardments. Israel has called up 7,000 army reservists so far, he added. Most analysts believe that the current build-up of a single division's worth of armor and infantry is not sufficient to conduct such a major incursion.  Militants in Gaza have fired more than 1,750 rockets toward Israel since the latest flareup began Monday afternoon, of which hundreds have failed or been intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome defense system. Israel has responded with devastating airstrikes in Gaza. Israel's bombing campaign in Gaza has now killed at least 119 people, including 31 children and 19 women, the Gaza-based Palestinian Health Ministry reported Friday. At least 830 people have sustained injuries as a result of Israeli airstrikes this week, the Health Ministry added. Seven Israelis have been killed and more than 200 have been injured since Monday, the Israeli military said. A 6-year-old boy was killed Wednesday when a rocket fired from Gaza struck a residential building in Sderot, according to an emergency responder. Addressing Israeli troops Thursday, Gantz said: ""I say explicitly: we will continue to defend and continue to attack until the fire is stopped and we will ensure long-term silence."" Rioting and violent clashes between Arab and Jewish citizens also swept across several Israeli cities this week, leading Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to warn against ""lynching"" by either community. In Bat Yam, south of Jaffa, graphic video Wednesday night showed a Jewish right-wing mob trying to lynch an Arab driver. Police say the man was dragged from his car before the assault began. Video shows about 20 people hitting him with metal objects and kicking him in the head repeatedly. He was taken to hospital where his injuries were described by police as moderate. In Acre, north of Haifa, a lynching attempt by an Arab mob left a Jewish man critically wounded, according to Israeli police. A police spokesman said the mob attacked police officers with stones before attacking the victim with stones and iron bars. Israel's Ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan, wrote to the Security Council on Thursday urging it to strongly condemn what he called terrorist attacks from Gaza, as well as to support Israel's ""right to defend itself,"" according to a statement. A day earlier, the Palestinians wrote to the UN Security Council President and the General Assembly President appealing for the Council to live up to its responsibility to maintain international peace and security. The United States has objected to a proposed Security Council statement and has so far blocked any action by the body, instead preferring more direct diplomacy.  A requested Security Council meeting on the crisis will not take place Friday because the US blocked the session, according to two UN diplomats. The US indicated it might accept a meeting next week, said one UN diplomat.  No ceasefire for now An Israeli foreign ministry spokesperson ruled out a ceasefire with Hamas in Gaza on Thursday.  ""We don't think this is the right time for a ceasefire,"" Lior Haiat told CNN. ""This is the time where Israel should defend itself and attack the terror infrastructure of Hamas... and we will get to a point where Hamas will understand that launching this kind terror attack on Israeli civilians is not effective for the future.""  Asked on whether any mediating countries have sent representatives to Israel, Haiat said ""he does not have this information ... but a ceasefire is not on the table for Israel now."" A senior Hamas official, Izzat Al Rishq, told CNN earlier Thursday that Egypt, Qatar and the United Nations were communicating with Hamas over mediation to end the fighting. ""We in Hamas have told them that they should speak to the enemy to stop the aggression first and after that, Hamas will decide,"" Al Rishq said.  ""We stress that we have the ability to sustain ourselves for the long haul and respond to the aggression (for) as long as it takes."" Fueled by controversy over planned evictions of Palestinian families in Jerusalem, and restrictions at a popular East Jerusalem meeting point as Ramadan began, conflict between Israelis and Palestinians boiled over this week, escalating rapidly into one of the worst rounds of violence between the two sides in the last several years.  Netanyahu slammed the communal violence in Israeli cities Wednesday as ""unacceptable"" and said he had ordered the police to adopt emergency powers, to reinforce with Border Police units, and to impose curfews where necessary.    ""Nothing justifies the lynching of Jews by Arabs and nothing justifies the lynching of Arabs by Jews,"" he said in a statement. ""To the citizens of Israel I say that I do not care if your blood is boiling. You cannot take the law into your own hands,"" Netanyahu added. ""You cannot grab an ordinary Arab citizen and try to lynch him -- just as we cannot watch Arab citizens do this to Jewish citizens."" ""We are very, very worried about this deterioration,"" Israeli lawmaker Aida Touma-Suleiman in Acre told CNN's Hala Gorani in a live interview late Wednesday evening local time.    ""The tear gas is filling the houses, and the situation is insecure. There has been attacks on Arab citizens in different cities today,"" she said. ""I'm really, really worried about this city (Acre). The same is happening in Haifa. The same is happening in Lod. There are different attacks on different citizens.""     The Israeli-Arab lawmaker went on to say: ""I'm not sure that the police is able or even willing to control the situation.""  Decades of coexistence 'trampled' Fury over the situation has fueled fierce protests in the central Israeli city of Lod, where Israeli police reported Wednesday that people were throwing rocks at passing cars and blocking roads into the early hours.  The mayor of Lod, Yair Revivo, said decades of coexistence had been ""trampled.""  He said Arab-Israeli rioters had been ""burning synagogues, Talmud Torah, dozens of vehicles, burning garbage containers, destroying Israeli flags and worse, lowering the Israeli flag and hoisting the Palestinian flag, on a night of riots that injured policemen and residents who found themselves besieged.""        Meanwhile an Arab-Israeli resident of Lod, Wael Essawi, told CNN that a mosque was stormed by Israeli police and Jewish residents during prayers on Tuesday night before tear gas was fired and cars were set ablaze.     ""We couldn't do anything but we opened the windows so we can breathe... it was very intense,"" Essawi said.  Another resident, Khaled Zabarqah, said that following a Palestinian demonstration on Monday against Israeli policies in Jerusalem, thousands were hit with tear gas, stun grenades and rubber bullets before Israelis started throwing stones and beating the group.     ""My 15-year-old daughter was woken up by the sound of stones being thrown at her bedroom window, I was then woken up by her terrified screams,"" Zabarqah said.     ""There was nothing we could do but protect and defend ourselves with any tools we have, it's either we defend ourselves or we get killed,"" he said. On Tuesday, a 25-year-old Arab-Israeli man was shot and killed in the city by a 34-year-old Jewish man, who fired on protesters after they targeted him with rocks, according to police. Police arrested two suspects in connection with another shooting also in Lod. Communal violence was also reported Wednesday in the Israeli cities of Tiberias, Umm al-Fahm and Hadera. Unrest has also spread to the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where at least 322 Palestinian protesters were injured during clashes with the Israeli army in the West Bank and with Israeli police in East Jerusalem on Wednesday, according to a Palestinian Red Crescent handout obtained by CNN.  Israel: 'Terror targets' struck The Israeli military said Thursday it had struck more than 600 ""terror targets"" in Gaza since the recent hostilities began. Israel has been ""able to strike a significant part if not the majority of the military leadership of Hamas"" in the past three days of bombardment, IDF spokesman Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus told reporters. Israel did not yet have an exact number of enemy combatants killed, Conricus said. ""As of yesterday it was more than 30. It has risen since,"" he said. The IDF has struck ""significant parts"" of Hamas' and Islamic Jihad's rocket-firing capability, he added, ""but it is by no means totally degraded."" The Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, said in a statement Thursday that it had carried out drone attacks on Israeli targets using new ""homemade 'Shehab' drones."" In a tweet, IDF spokesperson Avichay Adraee said Israeli forces were aware of the brigade's drone fleet and were able to ""hit"" them.  Global airlines -- including Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, United Airlines, Lufthansa and British Airways -- have all canceled flights to Israel amid the escalating violence.","{'neg': 0.317, 'neu': 0.683, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.7579}",70,177.0,0.126,0.86,0.014,-0.7253000000000001,0.149,0.816,0.035,-0.9997,-50.771,-90.09436666666666,199.0,-0.45273551088777214
The explosion of Israeli-Palestinian violence poses a test for Biden,2021-05-13,"""Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in."" Al Pacino's famous line in ""The Godfather: Part III"" might also apply to US presidents who try to avoid Middle East entanglements. Joe Biden, as he positions the United States for competition with China, has shown little inclination to throw himself into the region's treacherous politics. He had a front-row seat for the last 20 years as the Middle East shredded American lives, treasure and prestige.  His major concern is not the Israeli-Palestinian conflict but an attempt to revive the nuclear deal with Iran. The explosion of Israel-Palestinian violence will, however, test his posture since vital US interests remain hostage to turbulence in the Eastern Mediterranean. Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama tried and ultimately failed to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict with major initiatives. President Donald Trump said doing a deal was ""not as difficult"" as people think. But his proposal that massively favored the Israelis was always doomed. In a previous era, the US secretary of state's blue and white plane would have been flying between Israel, Egypt and Jordan on a ceasefire shuttle. The fact that US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is still at home is not just a reflection of US reticence. It also underscores how prospects for any serious Israeli-Palestinian negotiations have rarely been worse.  Years of an Israeli government under Benjamin Netanyahu that encouraged settlement growth in the occupied West Bank leave hopes for a contiguous Palestinian state grim. Israel's political instability deprives it of a strong government and further politicizes security issues. An aging, ineffective leadership in Ramallah and the power of militant group Hamas in Gaza have splintered Palestinian unity.  The violence might be good for only one party — Iran, which must hope the conflict will sever new ties between the Jewish state and some Arab nations. And anything involving Israel has strong US political reverberations. Liberals want Biden to be tougher on Netanyahu over Israeli airstrikes that kill civilians in Gaza and aggressive settlement policies they say filled a tinderbox. Republicans accuse the US President of setting the stage for violence by appeasing Iran, which funds Hamas. That puts the Iran deal in the mix too. If intricate diplomacy somehow does forge a nuclear compromise, it will be an even tougher sell in Washington while the Islamic Republic is accused of backing Hamas' hail of rockets on Israel.  So Biden may have no choice but to get pulled back in. 'Our engagement, a lot of it is happening privately' As violence in the Middle East claimed more than 70 lives this week, the US is quietly working to convey a message of ""de-escalation"" between Israelis and Palestinians.  White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Tuesday there had been 10 phone calls between ""senior Washington-based officials"" and Middle Eastern officials including Israeli, Palestinian, Qatari, Tunisian and Egyptian diplomats.  ""Our engagement, a lot of it is happening privately, through diplomatic channels, it's happening with officials in the region,"" she said. On Wednesday, Biden said he'd spoken at length to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Blinken has spoken with both the Israeli leader and with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. The United States has however blocked approval of a UN Security Council statement condemning the violence, which had been proposed by Norway. Two UN diplomats told CNN's Richard Roth that the US had informed other council members that it believed a statement could have a negative impact on diplomatic efforts to de-escalate.

At least 487 people have sustained various injuries, the ministry said.  Seven Israelis have been killed and more than 200 have been injured since Monday, the Israeli military said Wednesday.

Biden speaks with Netanyahu as Israeli and Palestinian violence pulls US focus back to Middle East,2021-05-12,"Entering office, President Joe Biden hoped to shift US foreign policy away from the Middle East and toward areas he thought of as more modern-day threats: China, Russia and cyberspace. But as some of the worst violence in years breaks out between Israelis and Palestinians, the region's long-entrenched battles are dragging Biden back in, forcing a delicate political balance and laying bare the difficulties he and his predecessors have all faced in handling the decades-old conflict. Speaking Wednesday for the first time since violence started flaring at the start of the week, Biden said he'd spoken at length to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier in the day. He voiced confidence in a swift end to the hostilities. ""My expectation and hope is this will be closing down sooner than later,"" Biden said at the White House. ""Israel has a right to defend itself when you have thousands of rockets flying into your territory."" Biden did not mention the Palestinians in his comments. He has come under pressure this week not only from Republicans, who are urging more robust backing of Israel, but from progressives in his own party, who have grown increasingly critical of Israel and who hope Biden's pledge to put human rights at the forefront of his foreign agenda will extend to Palestinians. Appearing on ""The Lead"" Wednesday afternoon, Gilad Erdan, Israel's ambassador to the US, defended the Israeli response and told CNN's Jake Tapper he was ""very, very pleased to hear the strong commitment of President Biden to Israel's right to defend itself, and to the safety and the security of the people of Israel."" At the same time, political instability in Israel and an indeterminate future for Netanyahu -- who enjoyed ample support from Biden's predecessor but who now exists in political limbo -- have lent further volatility. ""We're engaged in the Middle East whether we like it or not,"" former Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Connecticut, said in an interview Wednesday. ""So, we might as well acknowledge that and try to be engaged in the most constructive, strong and substantive way."" The timing of the latest conflict further complicates matters. Before the violence broke out, the Biden administration had been working in fragile indirect negotiations to reenter the Iran nuclear deal, an agreement Israel opposes so vehemently that it dispatched the head of its Mossad intelligence service to Washington to tell Biden personally that reentering it would be a mistake, according to people familiar with the meeting. And Biden is facing questions about why he has not yet named an ambassador to Israel -- or most other nations -- a delay that has led to frustrations among some State Department officials and donors. The President is poised to announce a wave of high-profile ambassador nominations before the end of May, a senior administration official tells CNN, including Israel. The current plan is to unveil the names of about 10 nominees, perhaps more, depending on the outcome of the final stages of vetting that is still underway by White House lawyers. On Wednesday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden plans to name a ""qualified, experienced ambassador"" to Israel in the ""coming weeks."" Still, Biden is behind his recent predecessors in naming an ambassador or special envoy. ""It clearly would be better if the US had an ambassador there now,"" said Lieberman, who served alongside Biden in the Senate for nearly two decades and is a strong supporter of Israel. Until an ambassador is nominated and ultimately confirmed, Lieberman said the President should send a US envoy to the region. ""Time is of the essence now,"" Lieberman told CNN. ""It would be a constructive move to have a temporary envoy working with the administration in the Middle East region from the State Department or National Security Council to go over there on behalf of the President or (Secretary of State Tony) Blinken and see if they can help tamp this down before it gets out of control."" On Wednesday morning, Blinken said he had asked a top State Department official ""to go to the region immediately to meet with Israeli and Palestinian leaders"" and urge de-escalation. Blinken said Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Israel and Palestinian Affairs Hady Amr ""will urge on my behalf, on behalf of President Biden, de-escalation of violence."" ""We are very focused on this,"" Blinken said in remarks at the State Department. ""The United States remains committed to a two-state solution. This violence takes us further away from that goal."" Also on Wednesday, the US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin spoke with his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Gantz, the latest in a spate of telephone calls from Washington to Israel as the situation devolved. Psaki said there had been 25 ""high level calls and meetings"" between Biden administration officials and counterparts in the region since the weekend.  One of those calls was between Blinken and Netanyahu Wednesday afternoon. Blinken also spoke with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas on Wednesday about ""the violence in Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza"" and to express ""his condolences for the lives lost as a result,"" the State Department said in a readout of the call. Blinken ""condemned the rocket attacks and emphasized the need to de-escalate tensions and bring the current violence to an end,"" the State Department said. On Tuesday, as Hamas rockets rained on Israeli cities, including Tel Aviv, and Israeli airstrikes pummeled Palestinian territory, Biden was briefed by his national security adviser Jake Sullivan, who -- along with Blinken -- has been in frequent contact with counterparts in the region. Those conversations, including on the issue of forced evictions of Palestinians from their homes in East Jerusalem, have at moments grown tense, according to US officials. The White House described them as ""candid"" on Tuesday, generally a term used to describe the airing of frank disagreements between allies. ""His team is communicating a clear and consistent message in support of de-escalation and that is our primary focus,"" Psaki said on Tuesday. ""The President's support for Israel's security, for its legitimate right to defend itself and its people is fundamental and will never waver."" She condemned Hamas rocket attacks, but also said, ""We stand against extremism that has inflicted violence on both communities."" ""We believe Palestinians and Israelis deserve equal measures of freedom, security, dignity and prosperity,"" Psaki said. A flashpoint rises The eviction situation, centered in the neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah, has become a main flashpoint amid rising tensions in Jerusalem. Israeli police have clashed with Palestinians for several days, with Palestinians accusing Jewish nationalists of provoking the confrontations. Biden, who last spoke with Netanyahu at the end of April following a deadly stampede at a religious celebration, has been watching the situation with concern, according to officials. He has asked Sullivan and Blinken to engage directly with officials on the ground in Israel. On Tuesday, the White House said Biden had also sent a letter to Abbas this week in response to a letter that Abbas had sent him earlier this year regarding the election. The Palestinian news agency said the letter ""dealt with the latest political developments, current situations, and bilateral relations between the United States and the State of Palestine,"" though a US National Security Council spokesperson said the missive was ""part of this administration's ongoing outreach with the Palestinian leadership on a range of issues of mutual interest, including ongoing efforts to de-escalate violence and restore calm."" In a phone call this weekend, Sullivan pressed his Israeli counterpart, Meir Ben-Shabbat, on the evictions issue, as well as encouraging steps to reduce the potential for violence during planned demonstrations on Jerusalem Day, which fell on Monday. Israeli officials eventually took those steps, including changing the route of a parade so it would not go through Muslim areas. But the violence has still escalated, leaving the White House to continue calling for calm. Sullivan spoke with Ben-Shabbat again on Tuesday, as well as unnamed Egyptian officials, according to the White House. Egypt played a central role in negotiating a ceasefire in 2014, when violence broke out between Israelis and Palestinians in Gaza. Biden himself has not addressed the situation before cameras. ""The question is not whether there is anything the United States can do. The question is whether or not the United States is willing and able to do them,"" said Aaron David Miller, a longtime US negotiator in the Middle East and CNN global affairs analyst. ""We could come up with any number of creative, sometimes very tough-minded ideas, that the administration could embrace. The question is will they, and so far it seems to be they're highly risk averse even in the face of this intensified conflict."" Biden tried to steer clear of Middle East Biden, who has emphasized the importance of navigating the United States out of the coronavirus pandemic and the incumbent economic crisis, has said addressing those domestic issues will put the US on stronger foreign footing. He has poured his attention into those matters in the early days of his presidency with the recognition his political standing will be almost entirely determined by how the US recovers. Unlike former President Donald Trump, Biden has not made it a primary goal to negotiate a peace deal between the Israelis and Palestinians. Though he has embraced aspects of Trump's approach -- primarily the normalization of relations between Israel and its Arab neighbors -- Biden's aides have dismissed aspects of the peace plan put forward by Trump toward the end of his term. Now there are calls from for Biden and his team to engage more fully in the matter, both from Republicans who have accused him of not standing with Israel but also, notably, from liberal Democrats who want him to speak out on the plight of the Palestinians. ""The United States must speak out strongly against the violence by government-allied Israeli extremists in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, and make clear that the evictions of Palestinian families must not go forward,"" Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who battled Biden for the Democratic presidential nomination, wrote on Twitter. ""The ongoing conflict and occupation cannot be ignored,"" the left-leaning advocacy group J Street said in a statement on Monday. ""Simply working to reduce tensions when violence boils over is not enough. This conflict demands bold, proactive and continuous diplomatic engagement from the Biden administration and the international community.""

"67 killed in Gaza, 7 killed in Israel as UN warns conflict could turn into 'full-scale war'",2021-05-12,"The worst violence in years between Israelis and Palestinians showed no signs of letting up Wednesday, as continued Israeli airstrikes and Hamas rocket fire prompted the United Nations to warn the conflict could mushroom into ""full-scale war.""  Israel's bombing campaign in Gaza has now killed at least 67 people, including 17 children, and injured more than 388 more, according to the Gaza-based Palestinian health ministry. Israel says at least 15 of the dead were Hamas militants. ""Stop the fire immediately. We're escalating towards a full-scale war,"" tweeted UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process Tor Wennesland. ""The cost of war in Gaza is devastating & is being paid by ordinary people. UN is working w/ all sides to restore calm. Stop the violence now.""  Militants in Gaza have fired more than 1,000 rockets into Israel since the latest flareup began Monday afternoon, injuring more than 200 Israeli civilians, the Israeli military said Wednesday. A six-year-old boy became the seventh Israeli fatality when a rocket fired from Gaza struck a residential building in Sderot, according to an emergency responder. Around 130 rockets hit Tel Aviv last night, forcing Israel's main international airport, Ben Gurion to close. Many of the rockets were intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome air defense system, but several struck Tel Aviv, setting a bus ablaze and killing one Israeli woman. Thousands of Israelis spent the night in bomb shelters. An Israeli soldier was also killed on Wednesday when Palestinian militants fired an anti-tank missile from Gaza, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement. Two soldiers were injured in the same incident, the IDF said. In Gaza, which has few bomb shelters and no air defense system, several buildings and apartments were damaged by Israeli airstrikes. One of those strikes destroyed Al-Shorouk Tower, a 14-storey building in the southern Gaza strip on Wednesday evening, the third high-rise to be targeted in recent days. The IDF said the tower housed Hamas military intelligence offices, as well as infrastructure used by ""the terror organizations to communicate tactical-military information.""  People in Gaza were in a ""state of panic"" due to the ongoing Israeli bombardment, said Ashraf al-Qidra, the Palestinian health ministry spokesman in Gaza.  Al-Qidra said Israel had deliberately targeted civilian homes and crowded residential neighborhoods, adding that 43% of the victims of strikes in Gaza were children and women. Omar Shaban, founder and director of PalThink for Strategic Studies, told CNN that Gazans felt trapped. ""I am in Gaza now. I am in my home. I cannot get out. Gaza is too small,"" he told CNN. ""You cannot escape from one place to another place.""  The Israeli military says it does everything it can to minimize civilian casualties when it is carrying out attacks. Earlier on Wednesday, the Israeli military said it had killed a number of key Hamas officials in a ""complex and first-of-its-kind operation"" at two separate locations. Among the dead, it said, was a Hamas Brigadier General and the head of the militant group's ""cyber and missile improvement system.""  Also on Wednesday, Israeli defense minister Benny Gantz said the IDF had hit command squads and Hamas infrastructure in an hours-long ""string of serious strikes."" ""We have hit many hundreds of targets. Buildings are falling, factories are collapsing, terror tunnels are being destroyed and commanders are being eliminated. All means and all options are on the table,"" he said, speaking in the city of Ashkelon, north of Gaza . There is currently ""no end date"" for the military operation against Gaza, Gantz also said. ""When Hamas will stop firing, Israel will stop firing,"" Israel's Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Tzipi Hotovely told CNN on Wednesday.  Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said in a televised speech Tuesday night that the group was ready if Israel ramped operations up further. ""If [Israel] wants to escalate, we are ready for it, and if it wants to stop, we're also ready. If they want to remove their hand over Jerusalem, we're ready,"" he said. The militants say their offensive is a response to the actions of Israeli police who fired stun grenades inside the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem -- one of the city's holiest sites -- on Monday morning. Hundreds of Palestinians went to hospitals for treatment after ensuing clashes with Israeli police. Video showed Palestinians throwing rocks and stones in sustained battles in and around the mosque with police, who fired rubber coated bullets, as well as stun grenades. The violence was the most serious the city has seen in years. The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court warned Wednesday that possible war crimes were being committed as the conflict escalated.  ""I note with great concern the escalation of violence in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, as well as in and around Gaza, and the possible commission of crimes under the Rome Statute,"" Fatou Bensouda said in a statement posted on Twitter. ""I echo the call from the international community for calm, restraint and a stop to the violence."" The United States has so far blocked approval of a UN Security Council statement on the ongoing violence, which had been proposed by Norway. Two UN diplomats told CNN that the US informed other Council members that it believes a statement could have a negative impact on diplomatic efforts to deescalate.  A spokesperson at the US Mission to the UN said ""the United States is engaging constructively to ensure any action by the Security Council is helpful in de-escalating tensions."" Asked about the bloodshed on Wednesday, US President Biden told reporters that he had recently spoken with Netanyahu. He said that his national security and defense staff were ""in constant contact"" with their Middle Eastern counterparts -- ""not just Israelis, but also everyone from the Egyptians to the Saudis to Emiratis,"" he said. Meanwhile, there is growing concern over emerging violence in a number of towns in Israel with a majority Arab population. On Wednesday, Israel declared a state of emergency in the central city of Lod after a second night of clashes between Jewish and Arab communities, which saw a synagogue set on fire. A CNN team driving through Lod early Wednesday saw streets strewn with rocks and burnt out cars on the side of roads. ""We have lost control of the city and the streets,"" Lod Mayor Yair Revivo told Israel's Channel 12 News. In a sign of how seriously Israel's leadership takes the unrest in Lod, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a visit to the city at 2 a.m. Wednesday morning to talk to local leaders.  Israel also said Wednesday it was sending reinforcements to mixed cities to quell the violence.

Battle between Israel and Hamas is an unwelcome surprise for Biden,2021-05-12,"Faced with the greatest challenge of national recovery since former President Franklin Roosevelt, President Joe Biden has made his top priority fixing America's broken home. He has  subsequently chosen his foreign policy priorities carefully -- Iran, China and climate.  Needless to say, the intractable Israeli-Palestinian conflict was not the top of the list. And yet the Middle East has a notorious habit of surprising the unprepared and unwary.   It is doubtful whether the current crisis in Jerusalem -- which has now grown into a larger battle between Israel and Hamas -- will impel the Biden administration to launch a full-throated effort to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But, at a minimum, it should compel the administration to do everything it can to defuse this dimension of the crisis.  The administration reportedly is planning to send a mid-level diplomat to the region to talk to the parties, and that's a decent start. But past flareups suggest that having a significant and concerted diplomatic effort to mediate between the two parties is critically important -- meaning that a higher-level diplomatic intervention by the Biden administration will soon be necessary. We are now well beyond the hortatory stage. What is required is a multipronged diplomatic effort that is based on a clear division of labor -- the US speaking to Israel, and America's Arab and European partners negotiating with Hamas in Gaza and the Palestinian Authority (Fatah) in the West Bank. Of course, there must be close cooperation, coordination and communication among and between all parties involved.  Egypt played a critical role in ending the seven-week war in 2014 by negotiating a series of ceasefires that helped to gradually tamp down the violence between Israelis and Palestinians. The Qataris, who have bankrolled Hamas' government in Gaza in the past, can also be deployed. And if Turkey were looking for a way to ingratiate itself with Washington, it might be willing, in the context of a synchronized stand-down by Israel, to play a constructive role.   The United States and the others must also involve the recent Abraham Accord players, especially the United Arab Emirates and Morocco, to determine what can be done. The four countries that normalized relations with Israel last summer -- UAE, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco -- carry weight, especially with the Israeli public, which greeted the new relationships with great satisfaction.  While another ceasefire may be necessary, it is only a first step. The next is to determine how to cement the stand-down and prevent another action-reaction escalatory spiral. Israel and Hamas have pursued on and off -- mostly the latter -- a long-term ceasefire coupled with a reduction in Israeli pressure on Gaza. These talks have not fared well, nor have Hamas-Fatah efforts to put an end to bitter internal divisions among Palestinian leadership created a unified government. Following Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' postponement of legislative elections, we suspect that Hamas will neither unify with Fatah nor give up control of Gaza.   A critical second imperative is to prevent any incident in Jerusalem from exploding into a countrywide conflagration. To begin to address this, the Biden administration will need to  assess the situation, specifically the degree to which radical settlers and the followers of the late extremist leader, Meir Kahane, have provoked this crisis. Extremists, including some right-wing Israeli politicians, have expanded their efforts to dispossess Palestinian residents of an East Jerusalem neighborhood. American leaders will have to do more if they want to get the Israeli government to stop the evictions in East Jerusalem, to arrest and prosecute the radical settlers who are fanning the flames and to assert unambiguously that the historical ""status quo"" on the Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount. At the same time, the Biden administration must make clear to the Palestinian Authority that it too must stop using the Jerusalem issue in its own rhetoric and social media to rile up its constituents.  The real tragedy in the current crisis is that we cannot envision -- at the moment or for the foreseeable future -- a pathway for Palestinians and Israelis to end their decades-long conflict. We have seen this tragic movie before, and each time it takes a predictable course in which civilian populations suffer because of the failures of their leaders, and in which nothing changes when the rockets stop falling from the sky.  The reality is that almost every breakthrough in this conflict has been preceded by war, violence and insurgency. But it was real leaders -- for example, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin in the 1970s and King Hussein of Jordan and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in the 1990s -- who changed course and led their countries on a pathway to peace. That kind of leadership and commitment is missing today. The recent crisis has only demonstrated the weakness and irrelevance of Abbas, already under fire for postponing scheduled Palestinian elections, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who having failed to form a new government, is now fighting for political survival.  However, there is time, even as the situation deteriorates, to change the recurring cycles of pain and war that lead nowhere but to more of each. Everyone must act, not just issue statements -- the Biden administration, Arabs, Europeans and, most of all, Israelis and Palestinians. Indeed, without Israeli and Palestinian buy-in, no amount of external pressure or inducement will end what promises to be an endless conflict.

"Israel holds all the cards in Jerusalem, yet the city has never been more divided",2021-05-11,"""Marhaba"" -- hello in Arabic -- began the brief text the middle-aged Jerusalem housewife found on her cell phone Monday evening. ""You have been identified participating in violent acts at Al Aqsa mosque. You will be held accountable. Israeli Intelligence.""  The housewife, who lives a few minutes' walk from the mosque, had gone to attend evening prayers. Her age and demeanor discounted the possibility she had joined hundreds of young men who had fought back with rocks and fireworks when Israeli security forces stormed into the Haram al-Sharif, or Temple Mount.  Many others received an identical message on their phones, including CNN producer Kareem Khadder, who was also on the Haram al-Sharif.  I called the number from which the text was sent, and it was inactive, and it's not clear whether the sender was indeed Israeli intelligence or someone else.  Yet one needn't spend much time here to understand that Israel possesses all the technical means at the disposal of a 21st century government to control a restive population.  In addition to the technology that tracks the movement of individual cell phones, Israel is using drones to keep a close eye on movements in and around the Old City, aided by hundreds of closed-circuit television cameras. Thousands of armed police have been deployed to put down the current eruption of unrest, aided by police trucks that spew what Palestinians call ""sewer water,"" a noxious liquid sprayed at protesters, bystanders, cars, shops and houses. Israel boasts legendary internal and external intelligence services, one of the best equipped and technically advanced armed forces on Earth, plus an officially denied but no less real nuclear arsenal. Yet despite all this, the Israeli state is struggling. Its main opponents in the streets and alleyways of Jerusalem are hundreds of mostly young Palestinian men.  Israel captured East Jerusalem, which includes the Old City, in June 1967 -- its annexation shortly afterwards was never recognized by the international community. Almost ​54 years later the city it claims to have reunited has never been more divided. Dispensing with his predecessor's passionate embrace of Israel and all its demands, President Joe Biden has reaffirmed his administration's faith in the two-state solution, whereby Israel and a future Palestinian state would live side by side.  But that solution is a relic of a time long past. In May 2018 I covered the protests in Gaza that coincided with the opening of the US embassy in Jerusalem. The Trump administration's unwavering endorsement of Israel's maximalist demands were the final nails in the coffin of the two-state solution.  If it died back then, the corpse is well advanced in its decomposition. Israel's settlement-building program in the occupied territories means that the fantasies entertained during the Oslo peace process -- of East Jerusalem as the capital of a functioning Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza -- simply isn't viable.  Israel under the leadership of embattled hardline Prime Minister ​Benjamin Netanyahu has pressed its technical and diplomatic advantage to the full. Repeated inconclusive elections in recent years have put him on the defensive from an even more extreme Israeli right for whom compromise with the Palestinians is anathema. Israel's center of gravity is now far to the right of what it was 30 years ago. The Palestinians are divided between an aging leadership in Ramallah, led by 85-year-old Mahmoud Abbas, and the militant Hamas faction, isolated by the international community, ruling an ever more impoverished Gaza. Abbas, Palestinian Authority president since 2005, recently canceled parliamentary elections and appears content to carry on his authoritarian rule. Hamas in Gaza is increasingly unpopular for its mismanagement, oppression and corruption. Firing crude missiles at Israel may bolster Hamas' credibility in some quarters, but the Israel​i counterattacks are likely to do little more than deepen the misery of Gaza's population. A new generation of young Palestinians is now revolting against this status quo, taking the Israelis and the Palestinian leadership by surprise. Israel has responded with force, the Palestinian Authority with empty rhetoric, Hamas and other factions in Gaza with rockets. And none of these responses will yield anything positive. The option that 20 years ago seemed a pipe dream, the so-called one-state solution, may be the only way to end this century-long conflict. This would involve what is today Israel proper, plus East Jerusalem, the West Bank and perhaps even Gaza, becoming one state where the same laws apply, and the same rights granted to all those living within its boundaries. At present the area Israel effectively controls is divided between citizens of Israel and the rest, living under two legal systems, with one side enjoying full rights and protection as citizens of the state, and the other side not. Call that set of affairs what you will. Human Rights Watch and the Israeli rights group B'tselem called it apartheid and have documented in meticulous detail exactly why they think that description fits. Israel denies it. Yet the events in Jerusalem, Gaza and elsewhere drive home a simple fact. This conflict has reached a dead end. The old approaches to resolving it -- whether through war or negotiations -- have failed. Neither side can win. But all can lose.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",43,183.0,0.0,0.909,0.091,0.25,0.083,0.828,0.09,-0.5187,10.75,-77.8971,241.0,-0.3232244813278008
At least 35 killed in Gaza as Israel ramps up airstrikes in response to rocket attacks,2021-05-11,"Tensions between Israelis and Palestinians have escalated further as Palestinian militants in Gaza fired hundreds of rockets into Israel, which responded with ramped up airstrikes on the coastal enclave, as unrest spread to cities and towns beyond Jerusalem.   As both sides traded airstrikes on Tuesday evening, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the nation from Tel Aviv, saying, ""We are in the midst of a significant operation."" Israeli bombing raids across Gaza have killed at least 35 people, including 12 children, according to Palestinian health officials, who also said 220 people have been injured, as of Tuesday evening. The Israeli military said it had killed more than 15 militants.    Rockets were fired towards Tel Aviv in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Sirens could be heard warning of an impending attack around 3 a.m. local time. It was not immediately clear if there were any casualties.  In the town of Ashkelon, two people were killed by rocket fire Tuesday, according to an Israeli military spokesman. A third person died in the town of Rishon Lezion, south of Tel Aviv on Tuesday evening after a rocket attack, Israeli media reported citing the ZAKA emergency service.  A CNN team heard at least 50 explosions in the coastal town near Gaza, and rocket fire was also reported in the city of Ashdod. At least 17 Israeli civilians have been treated for injuries from rocket attacks, the military said. On Wednesday, Israel declared a state of emergency in the central city of Lod and dispatched border police battalions to the area for reinforcements, according to the Government Press Office. The mixed Jewish-Arab city has seen protests escalate into riots this week. A CNN team driving through Lod early Wednesday saw roads strewn with rocks and burned out cars. Overnight, a rocket hit a house in Dahamesh, just outside the city, killing a 52-year-old man and his daughter, both Israeli-Arab citizens. The Israeli military said in a morning briefing Wednesday that a total of five Israeli civilians have now been killed since the start of the violent exchange of rocket fire and airstrikes between Gaza and Israel earlier this week. A 13-story building collapse A 13-story tower block in Gaza city collapsed on Tuesday night after it was hit by an Israeli airstrike, drawing vows of retaliation from militants.  The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that the building contained offices used by Hamas across several floors, including intelligence offices of its military wing, and a research and development unit working on rockets. The IDF also said it provided ""advance warning to civilians in the building and provided sufficient time for them to evacuate the site.""  There are reports that one person on a nearby street was injured in the building's collapse. Separately, in the early hours of Wednesday, two separate buildings were hit, a three-floor residential building in which three people were killed, Gaza health officials said, and a 10-story building which suffered major damage but saw no fatalities. The larger building, known as the al-Jawahera building, houses media network companies and other offices. Following the Israeli strike on the tower, a barrage of more than 200 rockets was then fired from Gaza into Israel. Earlier Hamas had warned if residential tower buildings in Gaza were targeted, they would not sit idle and would respond with rocket fire. The Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, says it responded with 210 rockets fired towards Beer Sheva and Tel Aviv. Palestinian Ministry of Health spokesman in Gaza Ashraf, Al Qidra, said many Gaza residents are now in a state of panic due to the ongoing Israeli airstrikes. ""The deliberate targeting of civilian houses and crowded residential neighborhoods puts more than half of the population of the Gaza Strip, including women and children, in a state of panic,"" Al Qidra said in a post to Twitter on Wednesday. He said the ongoing Israeli airstrikes have ""dangerous psychological repercussions due to frightening and successive sounds of explosions, scenes of destruction and victims."" Al Qidra also said 43% of the victims in Gaza are children and women. Gaza's Interior Ministry's spokesman Iyad al-Bazam also said in a statement released Wednesday that dozens of Israeli airstrikes hit several areas in Gaza. Most airstrikes hit Gaza City and Khan Yunis in the southern portion of Gaza. No signs of de-escalation  In the past two days, Hamas and Islamic Jihad in Gaza have fired at least 500 rockets into Israel, forcing the closure of Israel's main international airport, Ben Gurion, about fifteen kilometers east of Tel Aviv.  The militants say it is a response to the actions of Israeli police who fired stun grenades inside the Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem -- one of the city's holiest sites -- on Monday morning.  Hundreds of Palestinians went to hospitals for treatment after ensuing clashes with Israeli police, in the most serious violence seen in the city in weeks.  ""We have the right to respond to the Israeli offensive and protect the interests of our people as long as the Israeli occupation continues the escalation,"" Hamas said in a statement. The Israeli military has conducted more than 150 strikes in Gaza as of Tuesday afternoon, according to a military spokesman, who said Israel had also called up 5,000 reserve troops to active duty to ""enhance"" its operation in Gaza. A number of deaths were reported in strikes in Beit Hanoun in northern Gaza. Among them were Amira Abdel-Fattah, 57, who was killed in her apartment along with her son who has special needs, Ibrahim al-Masri, 11, and his brother Marwan, 7, the Palestinian health ministry said. The Israeli army says it is investigating.  A Palestinian man in Gaza told CNN over the phone that the sounds of Israeli strikes throughout Monday night, as well as the sound of outgoing rocket fire, had been ""horrifying."" The man, who declined to be named, described a mood of anger in Gaza over recent events in Jerusalem. ""It's the fact the Israelis targeted Al Aqsa, during Ramadan, while people were praying"" that has so riled people, he said.  The man added that Israel's actions would only embolden support for Hamas, and that he believed militants should continue firing rockets. Meanwhile, Arab citizens of Israel demonstrated Monday evening and Tuesday in the streets of several Israeli cities and villages, including Haifa and Lod, in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza and Jerusalem.  In Lod, a 25-year-old Arab-Israeli man was shot dead by a 34-year-old Jewish resident who said he was responding to stones being thrown at him. Two people were arrested in connection with that incident, police said. Israeli police said around 150 violent protesters had been arrested in multiple locations. Rioters attacked drivers, threw stones at passing cars, blocked roads and ignited trees tires and a car, according to police.  International community calls for calm  The United States and European Union called for a de-escalation of violence while several countries in the Middle East, including Turkey, condemned the Israeli police response to tensions in Jerusalem.  One of the main sources of growing unrest in recent days has been the possible eviction of several Palestinian families from their homes in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah.  Israeli police have clashed with Palestinians in the neighborhood, as well as other locations, for several weeks now, with Palestinians accusing Jewish nationalists of provocation and police of heavy-handed tactics.  Nearly a thousand Palestinians were injured in East Jerusalem, and over 200 in the West Bank, between May 7 and May 10, according to the United Nations and the Palestinian Red Crescent.  On Tuesday, UN human rights experts expressed ""grave concerns about Israel's aggressive response to protests in East Jerusalem, and called on Israel, as an occupying power, to immediately lift its threat to evict hundreds of Palestinian households from their legally protected homes."" ""Re-establishing calm in Jerusalem is important, but creating the conditions for justice and equality in the City are even more important,"" the experts said in the statement.  The UN also denounced Israeli airstrikes in Gaza as well as Palestinian rocket shelling.  US President Joe Biden has received a briefing from his national security adviser on the ongoing violence between Israelis and Palestinians, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday.  Biden had directed his team to ""engage intensively"" with Israeli and Palestinian leaders, she said.  ""His team is communicating a clear and consistent message in support of de-escalation and that is our primary focus. The President's support for Israel's security, for its legitimate right to defend itself and its people is fundamental and will never waver."" She condemned Hamas rocket attacks into Jerusalem but also said ""we stand against extremism that has inflicted violence on both communities."" US officials have ""spoken candidly"" with Israeli officials about the eviction of Palestinians from East Jerusalem, Psaki said, saying they worked against shared interests of reducing violence. ""We believe Palestinians and Israelis deserve equal measures of freedom, security, dignity and prosperity,"" she said.","{'neg': 0.346, 'neu': 0.654, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.8126}",62,184.0,0.0,0.938,0.062,0.2023,0.154,0.784,0.063,-0.9994,12.5426,-32.4725,262.0,-0.12394083969465648
Israel launches airstrikes after rockets fired from Gaza in day of escalation,2021-05-10,"Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza have been exchanging fire through the night after clashes in Jerusalem Monday left hundreds injured and tensions sky high, prompting an uptick in the violence, official sources and pictures showed.  Israeli airstrikes have left at least 24 dead, including nine children, in Gaza, according to Palestinian health officials. The Israel Defense Forces says it killed 15 militants. Meanwhile, at least six were injured in the Israeli city of Ashkelon on Tuesday morning after a residential building was struck with rocket fire from Gaza and after the Al-Qassam Brigades, the militant wing of Hamas, vowed to ""make Ashkelon hell."" Pictures from the scene showed holes in the wall of the building, windows blown out, and damage to cars on the street outside the building. The IDF said on Tuesday morning that 200 rockets have been fired from Gaza towards Israel since the hostilities flared Monday. IDF spokesman Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus said 90% of the rockets that penetrated the Gaza-Israeli border were intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome air defense system. The IDF killed 15 Hamas and Islamic Jihad operatives, according to Conricus. He also said Israeli forces struck about 130 ""military targets"" said to belong mostly to Hamas, including manufacturing and storing facilities as well as military bases or compounds. Conricus says the IDF targeted a Hamas operations and intelligence room in southern Gaza, as well as a Hamas battalion commander in a high-rise building. Hamas issued a statement saying ""as long as the Israeli occupation continues to perpetrate crimes and violations against the Palestinian people, the Palestinian resistance groups, including Hamas, will respond and defend Jerusalem, Al-Aqsa Mosque, and the Gaza Strip."" The statement goes on to say, ""we have the right to respond to the Israeli offensive and protect the interests of our people as long as the Israeli occupation continues the escalation."" Jersualem has seen repeated confrontations between Israeli police and Palestinians across the city for several weeks now, with Palestinians accusing Jewish nationalists of provocation and police of heavy-handed tactics.   A new escalation in violence Monday's violence marked a grim new turn, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu describing the barrage of missiles as having ""crossed a line"" and vowing to ""respond with great force.""  ""We are in a fight on several fronts: Jerusalem, Gaza and elsewhere in the country. This evening, on Jerusalem Day, the terrorist organizations in Gaza have crossed a red line and attacked us with missiles in the outskirts of Jerusalem,"" Netanyahu said at a ceremony at Ammunition Hill to mark Jerusalem Day.   Netanyahu also said that while Israel does not seek an intensification of hostilities, ""the current conflict could continue for some time.""    Monday's violence in and around the Al Aqsa mosque was the most serious seen in the city in the last few weeks. Videos from early morning showed Israeli police inside the mosque firing stun grenades. Palestinians were filmed throwing rocks. After a relative lull that lasted much of the day, there were further clashes in the late evening when Israeli police again entered the mosque after night prayers. A paramedic, Ramzi Halaq, who was inside the mosque when the police entered a second time told CNN, ""the police were targeting us directly as paramedic ... and were preventing us from conducting our duties and taking out the injured."" By midnight, the Palestinian Red Crescent said that 520 people had been injured through the course of the day with 333 people requiring treatment in hospital. Adding to tensions on Monday, a car drove into two pedestrians near the Lion's Gate entrance to the Old City after it was pelted with stones, according to video of the incident.  The car, carrying religious Israelis, came under attack by young Palestinians as it tried to change direction, before it accelerated forward and mounted the curb, sending two people hurling backward. Police said the driver had lost control of the vehicle and that its occupants were slightly injured. The condition of the two people it struck is not yet known. Sheikh Jarrah: A neighborhood at the center of unrest One of the main sources of growing unrest in recent days has been the possible eviction of several Palestinian families from their homes in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah. On Sunday, Israel's Supreme Court postponed an appeal hearing on the decades-long legal case.    A pro-settler organization called Nahalat Shimon is using a 1970 law to argue that the owners of the land before 1948 were Jewish families, and so the current Palestinian landowners should be evicted and their properties given to Israeli Jews.   Palestinians say restitution laws in Israel are unfair because they have no legal means to reclaim property they lost to Jewish families in the late 1940s in what became the state of Israel.   The situation in Sheikh Jarrah has drawn worldwide attention, with the United States again expressing concern on Monday.   White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the US had ""serious concerns"" about the violence in Israel before adding that President Biden is continuing to monitor the situation.   ""This is something that our national security team is closely monitoring, obviously, across government, certainly the President is kept abreast and is watching closely as well, Psaki told reporters at a White House briefing.   US National security adviser Jake Sullivan had a call with his counterpart in Israel, Meir Ben-Shabbat, on Sunday regarding the situation in Jerusalem.   On the phone call, Sullivan highlighted recent engagements by senior US officials with senior Israeli and Palestinian officials and key regional stakeholders to press for steps to deescalate tensions, according to a readout provided by the White House.   Sullivan reiterated the United States has serious concerns about the potential evictions of Palestinian families from their homes in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood, the readout says.   ""They agreed that the launching of rocket attacks and incendiary balloons from Gaza towards Israel is unacceptable and must be condemned,"" according to the readout.   ""Sullivan expressed the administration's commitment to Israel's security and to supporting peace and stability throughout the Middle East, and assured Mr. Ben-Shabbat that the U.S. will remain fully engaged in the days ahead to promote calm in Jerusalem,"" the readout said. International calls for calm International calls to curb the violence emerged quickly following the aerial attacks.    US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the rocket attacks against Israel ""need to stop immediately"" and called for de-escalation by ""all sides.""   The US is ""very deeply concerned about the rocket attacks that we're seeing now, that need to stop and need to stop immediately,"" Blinken said, speaking alongside Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi at the State Department. ""Even as all sides take steps to de-escalate, Israel of course has a right to defend its people and its territory from these attacks.""    Blinken also spoke of concerns over the ""provocative actions"" in and around Haram al-Sharif, the third-holiest site in Islam, which is also known to Jews as Temple Mount.   Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi echoed Blinken's remarks, describing the situation as ""extremely dangerous"" and saying the priority is to ""stop the escalation, make sure that international law is respected, rights of Palestinians, rights of worshippers are upheld, status quo is preserved and move forward to creating that political horizon"" that would allow for a comprehensive peace.""","{'neg': 0.247, 'neu': 0.753, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.5574}",45,185.0,0.22666666666666668,0.742,0.031,-0.7728,0.121,0.817,0.062,-0.9977,-34.776,-54.3213,241.0,-0.22539958506224067
Yair Lapid gets mandate to try to form next Israeli government,2021-05-05,"Centrist lawmaker Yair Lapid has been tasked with trying to form a new government in Israel, after longtime Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was forced to admit failure in his efforts to reach agreement with potential coalition allies on Tuesday night. Lapid, whose Yesh Atid party came second in the March 23 election to Netanyahu's Likud, received the mandate Wednesday evening from President Reuven Rivlin. After consulting with all the parties in parliament, Rivlin said: ""It is clear Member of Knesset Lapid has a chance to form a government that will get support in the Knesset, although there are considerable difficulties."" The Yesh Atid leader now has four weeks to try to put together a coalition of parties from the far-right to the left, including, most likely, support from some Arab lawmakers. ""A unity government isn't a compromise or a last resort -- it's a goal, it's what we need. We need a government that will reflect the fact that we don't hate one another. A government in which left, right and center will work together to tackle the economic and security challenges we face. A government that will show that our differences are a source of strength, not weakness,"" Lapid said in a statement released immediately after receiving the mandate. His primary task will be to convince former Defense Minister Naftali Bennett and his right-wing Yamina party to agree to join the coalition. By way of enticement, Lapid has already offered Bennett a rotating Prime Ministership, in which the Yamina leader would go first. Up to now, Bennett has said his preference would be for a right-wing administration, but he has not ruled out taking part in a unity government.  Rivlin said Bennett had told him he was looking for a ""broad and stable government."" Bennett did not rule out forming a government with Lapid, the President added. In an important remark, Rivlin also indicated that while Lapid now had the mandate, he would still be able to go second in any rotating Premiership deal he might succeed in striking. Netanyahu remains Israel's Prime Minister until any new government is agreed and sworn-in.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",15,186.0,0.04533333333333334,0.8263333333333334,0.12833333333333333,0.12636666666666665,0.012,0.866,0.122,0.9794,1.8954999999999997,-42.4634,200.0,-0.212317

Your city really is getting warmer.  Here's what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.  (You can also get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Coronavirus President Biden has a new Covid-19 goal: at least one vaccine dose to 70% of US adults and 160 million fully vaccinated by July 4. That would mark a sharp slowdown in vaccination pace, something that's already happening across the country. So far, about 145 million people -- about 56% of all adults in the US -- have gotten at least one dose. States are also getting ready to vaccinate 12- to 15-year-olds once the FDA approves the Pfizer vaccine for that group. Pfizer also has its eye on authorization for 2- to 11-year-olds in September. Meantime in Brazil, the parliamentary inquiry into the government's Covid-19 response has begun. The nation's former health minister said yesterday that President Jair Bolsonaro was warned about the consequences of ignoring science and common pandemic safety measures.  2. Facebook The Facebook Oversight Board will announce its long-anticipated decision on the fate of former President Trump's Facebook account at 9 a.m. ET today. Trump's Facebook and Instagram accounts were suspended indefinitely a day after the Capitol riot in January. (YouTube and Twitter made similar moves.) The decision on Trump's Facebook account is so contentious and historic, Facebook itself isn't doing the deliberating. The oversight board is an independent body described as a kind of Supreme Court for the social network. Its decision today will set extremely important precedents for content moderation that could ripple through the social media -- and political -- worlds. 3. Mueller probe A federal judge has rejected the Justice Department's attempts to withhold the release of a secret memo, written for former Attorney General William Barr, regarding the department's opinion not to charge Trump with obstruction at the end of the Mueller investigation. Judge Amy Berman Jackson dismissed the DOJ's reasoning that the largely redacted March 2019 memo was legal reasoning to help Barr make a decision about Trump. She said she believed Barr and his advisers had already decided they wouldn't charge the President with a crime and the memo was partly strategic planning -- and therefore could be made public. The decision adds to the criticism federal judges and others have had about Barr and his handling of the end of the Mueller probe -- and his desire to keep documents related to the investigation under wraps. 4. Afghanistan The ongoing withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan could threaten the progress of women's rights in the country, even if the Taliban doesn't fully take power, according to a newly declassified US intelligence report. The report says progress for women's rights in Afghanistan over the last two decades probably relied more on ""external pressure than domestic support"" and thus could falter without foreign backing. The report also concluded the Taliban's policies toward women, girls and ethnic minorities hasn't changed, putting them in potential danger when it comes to issues like child marriage and sexual violence. The US secretary of state has warned the Taliban that any backslide in Afghan women's rights would carry diplomatic consequences. 5. Israel Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has missed a deadline to form a new government, extending the country's long political deadlock. Instead, Netanyahu bounced the mandate to form a new government back to President Reuven Rivlin, who now must decide which of Israel's other political leaders he might entrust with trying to form a governing coalition. Israel has gone through four elections in two years, and none has resulted in a definite governing structure in the Knesset, Israel's parliament. The government's future may hinge on Naftali Bennett, a former defense minister and right-wing party leader. Both Netanyahu and another major party leader have offered Bennett the prime ministership in a sort of rotation deal. Bennett says he's not opposed to forming a unity government made up of a wide array of parties.

Netanyahu misses deadline to build a new government. Here's what comes next,2021-05-04,"Benjamin Netanyahu's hold on the Premiership of Israel looks a little less secure after a deadline to build a new government passed at midnight (5pET).    Seconds before the deadline passed, a statement from the Prime Minister's Likud party announced he had returned the mandate to form a new government back to President Reuven Rivlin.      The onus is now on the President to decide which of Israel's other political leaders he might entrust with the task of trying to form a governing coalition, or whether to pursue a different path to secure a breakthrough.     The favourite to get the nod is centrist Yair Lapid, whose Yesh Atid party came second behind Netanyahu's Likud in the March 23rd election.    Lapid is a one-time Finance Minister who entered politics in 2012 after a successful career as a TV news anchor.    But even if Lapid is given the mandate, the key man in coalition negotiations looks set to be Naftali Bennett, a former Defense Minister and leader of the right-wing Yamina party.    Even though his party won only seven seats in the 120-seat Knesset, Bennett finds himself in the extraordinary position of having been offered the Prime Ministership by both Netanyahu and Lapid, both of whom have offered him a rotation arrangement and said he can go first.    Up to now, Bennett has said his preference is for a right-wing administration, but he has not ruled out a unity government straddling a wide array of parties from right to left.     When asked by CNN how quickly such a unity government could be formed if Lapid were given the mandate, one individual close to negotiations said, ""As quickly as Bennett wants.""    ""There is no reason it could not happen in a week if he decides he is going for it,"" the individual added.    Another individual with knowledge of the negotiations told CNN that Bennett needed to allow Netanyahu's mandate to expire without success in order to show that a right-wing government was not possible.    ""He can't take the blame for that,"" the second individual said.    Benny Gantz, Israel's current Defense Minister, made an appeal to his predecessor Tuesday evening not to hesitate.    ""Naftali Bennet, I know that you're a person of values. I know that Israel is important to you...You must announce today that you are joining a pro-change government and that you support the presidential mandate being granted to MK Yair Lapid...You are a person of values. Don't let Netanyahu trample you,"" Gantz said.    Israel's Prime Minister had also made a last-minute appeal to Bennett's values as the mandate's deadline drew close, posting a clip from the election campaign of the Yamina leader declaring he would not back a government with Yair Lapid, and declaring, ""I am a right winger and it [would] contradict my values. And for me, values have weight.""    ""Naftali, prove you are still a right-winger,"" Netanyahu's tweet implored.    Israel's fourth election in under two years, like the previous three, was seen first and foremost as a referendum on Israel's longest-serving leader.    Netanyahu has been on trial since last May on bribery, fraud and breach of trust charges.    He denies the charges and has used them as a rallying cry for his right-wing base, describing the proceedings as a witch-hunt pursued by liberal elites and the media.    But his campaign was not enough to prevent another deadlocked parliament, which prompted the Israeli leader to attempt to bring together some unlikely bedfellows in his efforts to stay in power.    His hopes were dashed when the extreme-right wing Religious Zionist party refused to be part of any government which had the support of the United Arab List, an Islamist party which had itself broken new ground by making clear it could support a government led by Prime Minister Netanyahu.    With the mandate now back in his hands, the President is set to consult again Wednesday with the parties before deciding on his next move, expected within the next few days.     Instead of giving it to an individual, he could choose to hand the mandate over to parliament, effectively inviting any of the parliamentarians to come back to him as the head of a 61-seat majority.    Until any new government is agreed and sworn into office, Benjamin Netanyahu remains Israel's Prime Minister.

Deadline looms for Netanyahu to build new government in Israel,2021-05-04,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has one more day to convince potential partners to join him in a new government, or risk seeing the country's President hand the opportunity to a rival.  One of the key figures Netanyahu needs to get onboard is former Defense Minister Naftali Bennett of the right-wing Yamina party.   Bennett appeared to reject an offer by Netanyahu to rotate the Premiership on Monday, even though the offer included Bennett going first in the rotation.  But even if he changes his mind over the course of the day, that still would not be enough for Netanyahu to enjoy a majority in the Knesset, Israel's parliament.  For that to happen, the Israeli leader either needs to win over two more lawmakers from parties currently pledged to oppose him, or somehow find a way for his allies in the extreme-right Religious Zionist Party to accept joining a government that would be supported by the United Arab List, an Islamist party led by Mansour Abbas, something they have thus far ruled out.  If there is no breakthrough by midnight (5 p.m. ET) Netanyahu can ask President Reuven Rivlin for two more weeks' negotiating time.   Even though it is customary for the President to grant such a request, Rivlin has indicated his frustrations with proceedings since the poll on March 23 -- the country's fourth election in two years -- so the Prime Minister will know he cannot take such an extension for granted.  Instead, Rivlin could decide to ask Yair Lapid to try to form a government.  Lapid's centrist Yesh Atid party came second behind Netanyahu's Likud in the election, and the former TV news anchor has been hard at work over the last four weeks trying to assemble his own coalition of allies.  Like Netanyahu, Lapid has also offered Bennett the chance to go first in a rotating Premiership that would lead a government made up of a broad array of parties from the far-right to the left.","{'neg': 0.151, 'neu': 0.849, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.1531}",10,189.0,0.04114285714285714,0.8360000000000001,0.123,0.3298,0.032,0.804,0.164,0.9932,3.298,-25.54295714285714,139.0,-0.18376228160328878
"As families bury their dead, recriminations begin over deadly crush at a religious festival in Israel",2021-05-02,"As the Shabbat drew to a close in Israel, funerals for the victims of Friday's crush at Mount Meron have resumed -- and so have the recriminations over the mountaintop disaster that killed 45 people, including children. Flags flew at half-staff on the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, and other public buildings on Sunday, marking a day of national mourning for those killed when the religious festival turned into a deadly stampede. The somber mood was accompanied by a fierce public debate and accusations over the behavior of key public officials as well as Israel's ultra-Orthodox communities, from which most of the dead and wounded come.  Early Sunday morning, officials from the Institute of Forensic Medicine said all of the bodies had been identified, with all but one of the bodies transferred to families for burial. The final body is expected to be released in the coming hours.    Tensions have been running high in ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods with some people angry the process had not been completed before the beginning of Shabbat, which meant they had to wait over a day to bury their loved ones.   Police reported dozens of ultra-Orthodox men had blocked a main Jerusalem street and set fire to trash in a protest late Saturday evening.  Politically, much of the initial blame for the mountaintop disaster has been focused on Public Security Minister Amir Ohana, whose ministry includes responsibility for the police.  Ohana, a member of Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party, and one of the Prime Minister's most loyal allies, made an appearance at the festival just hours before the crush took place.  He took to Facebook Saturday evening to praise the police officers involved and said he accepted responsibility for what happened, but not blame.  ""I am responsible, but responsibility does not mean blame. This year's celebration took place as every year, for hundreds of years, even before the State of Israel was established. At the time of the disaster there were fewer people staying on the mountain than in normal years, many fewer. This disaster happened this year, but could have happened any other year,"" he wrote at the end of a lengthy post.  Eyewitness accounts suggest the incident -- at Mount Meron in the north of the country -- happened as a dense crowd of people attempted to leave one of the main festival sites down a narrow sloping walkway. People began slipping on the floor and falling to the ground, with those behind them falling on top of them causing crushing and suffocation, witnesses said. An official with knowledge of the list of fatalities told CNN they expected the death toll to include five US citizens. Two Canadians were also killed in the crush, according to a statement from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. More than 100 people were injured, according to the Health Ministry. Four remained in a serious condition in hospital as of Saturday evening.  Public Security Minister Ohana's sentiments echoed in part outspoken comments a day earlier by Shlomo Levi, former head of the Merom HaGalil regional council, where the annual religious festival takes place.  He told Israel's Channel 13 News the mountain had been ""a ticking time-bomb for years"" and went on, ""I knew this would happen, and I even issued a warrant to shut down the site. But police could not enforce it, and the public security minister was under pressure [to keep it open].""  The festival is estimated to have drawn about 100,000 people this year, making it the largest public gathering by far since Israel began emerging from the coronavirus pandemic.   Last year a far smaller event was held, but some years up to 400,000 people attend, according to informed estimates, to sing, dance and light fires at the burial site of second-century sage Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai. Levi told Channel 13 News he blamed the leaders of the mostly Hassidic sects that take part in the Lag B'Omer festival, along with their political representatives in government, for running what he described as ""a mafia"" that controlled the festival site.  ""This mountain is strange. It is supposed to be clean and religious when it is in fact it is corrupt in the full sense of the word,"" he said. Haaretz journalist Anshel Pfeffer, in an article published Friday, also focused on the power wielded by ultra-Orthodox politicians in Israel, comparing the absence of government control at the Mount Meron site with the failure to enforce coronavirus lockdown restrictions among ultra-Orthodox communities.  ""In Israel, there are places that are beyond the police's jurisdiction, autonomies where the state doesn't even try to assert its sovereignty. Rabbi Shimon's tomb is an autonomy, just like the ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods in Jerusalem and Bnei Brak,"" he wrote. In a growing indication that the tolerance many Israelis feel is shown towards the ultra-Orthodox might be slipping, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has spoken out about the abuse it said its female soldiers received as they took part in rescue and recovery efforts at the festival site. In a strongly worded statement, the IDF said, ""At the beginning of the Home Front Command's assistance operation at the tomb complex on Mount Meron, some of those present began to verbally and physically harm the IDF women fighters, who were on their way to evacuate the wounded. The force continued its mission ignoring the abusive behavior. The IDF views the incident very seriously and condemns any violence, physical or verbal, against its female and male soldiers.  Defense Minister Benny Gantz, himself a former chief of staff, tweeted his support for the IDF statement.  Two of Israel's most senior politicians, Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Naftali Bennett, visited Mount Meron on Friday to express their condolences and to vow that such a disaster should never happen again.  Both men were heckled by ultra-Orthodox still present at the site, many blaming the police for the fatal stampede. ""They closed the barricades until people couldn't breathe and died,"" one man shouted at Bennett.  In comments tweeted Friday morning, the leader of the largest ultra-Orthodox party in the Knesset, Aryeh Deri of Shas, wrote, ""The heart is torn ... our dance has turned into mourning. I call on the public to pray and to tear down the gates of heaven for the healing of the wounded, to support and strengthen the families who have lost their relatives ... May God wipe away a tear from every face. Amen."" Neither Deri nor his counterpart in the other ultra-Orthodox party represented in parliament, Moshe Gafney of United Torah Judaism, have addressed any claims of responsibility. Both men are absolutely key to Prime Minister Netanyahu's ongoing attempts to form a new government following the inconclusive March election.","{'neg': 0.28, 'neu': 0.569, 'pos': 0.152, 'compound': -0.4019}",44,190.0,0.05333333333333334,0.8466666666666667,0.10033333333333333,0.1347,0.137,0.763,0.1,-0.9933,5.926799999999999,15.159842857142863,138.0,0.10985393374741205
The facts around leaked audio about John Kerry,2021-05-01,"Republicans have seized on a recent claim that former Secretary of State John Kerry told Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif about Israeli strikes on Iranian interests in Syria. Zarif made the allegation in leaked audio, a claim which, if true, would undermine the US relationship with Israel.  Though Kerry has flatly denied that any such conversation took place, a group of Republican senators have asked the President to investigate the allegation. A handful of other congressional Republicans are calling for Kerry's resignation from his current position on the National Security Council if the allegations are confirmed.  Here's what we know to be the facts.  On Sunday, London-based news channel Iran International, published an article detailing leaked audio of a March interview between Zarif and Iranian journalist Saeed Laylaz, apparently scheduled for release in August, once the current administration leaves office. Laylaz is considered sympathetic to Iran's current President and was an adviser to Iran's former President Mohammad Khatami, a reformist.  According to the news article by Iran International, Zarif claimed, ""It was former US Foreign Secretary John Kerry who told me Israel had launched more than 200 attacks on Iranian forces in Syria.""  Iran International specifically noted this claim was ""not very credible.""  Though the sentence about Kerry was part of just one paragraph in a longer article, which included Zarif's criticism of Iran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the assassinated top general Qasem Soleimani, the claim about Kerry was quickly amplified by several conservative-leaning publications including Fox News, the New York Post and the Daily Caller.  The authenticity of the tape itself (ie not the veracity of Zarif's claim, but whether he even said it) as a whole has not been officially confirmed, but Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh did not deny its validity during the weekly news conference.  Kerry push back Kerry, who served as secretary of state from February 2013 to January 2017, disputed the allegations in a tweet Monday. ""I can tell you that this story and these allegations are unequivocally false,"" he tweeted. ""This never happened - either when I was Secretary of State or since."" When asked about the allegations during a press briefing Monday, State Department spokesman Ned Price said he couldn't speak to the accuracy or authenticity of the audio or its claims, but implied that if such a conversation had occurred, Kerry would likely not have been disclosing secret information.  ""I would just make the broad point that if you go back and look at press reporting from the time, this certainly was not secret,"" Price said. ""And governments that were involved were speaking to this publicly, on the record."" That is true. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in July 2017 that Israeli airstrikes have targeted Hezbollah-bound convoys in Syria ""dozens of times."" A month later, Israeli Air Force chief Maj. Gen. Amir Eshel confirmed that Israel had attacked convoys bringing arms to Hezbollah several times over the past five years.

Crush at religious festival in Israel's Mount Meron kills 45 people,2021-04-30,"Hundreds of buses stretched over miles of winding road were ferrying thousands of worshipers off Mount Meron in northern Israel on Friday after 45 people were killed and some 150 others injured in a crush at a mass Jewish gathering overnight. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the incident a ""huge disaster,"" while paramedics described chaotic scenes of teams administering CPR en masse to people, including children, lying breathless on the ground.  According to the Institute of Forensic Medicine, 32 of the victims have been identified, with 22 of those released for burial. An official with knowledge of the list of fatalities said the final death toll is expected to include five US citizens. The official said several factors were delaying an official statement, including the need to inform the families privately of their loss and Shabbat regulations. Families of two US citizens had already been told of their loss, the official said, and three more were expected to follow. Kalanit Taub, a first responder, described a ""horrific scene"" with ""nonstop people to care for."" ""I saw 20-plus CPRs ongoing at the same time,"" Taub told CNN. ""Anywhere you looked, you saw another person doing CPR.""  In the hours afterward, she said she saw people crying or staring into space, struggling to process what they had seen. Israeli investigators are examining exactly how the crush happened at the mountain, where worshipers marked the Lag B'Omer holiday, an annual event where participants sing, dance and light fires in homage to second-century sage Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai at his burial site. Israel's health ministry had urged people not to attend the festival, warning of the risk of another coronavirus outbreak. However, case numbers have been low, and Israel has already fully vaccinated more than 58% of its population, so the event was allowed to proceed.  Dov Maisel, vice president of operations of the volunteer-based emergency organization United Hatzalah, told CNN that around 100,000 people were in attendance, though such numbers aren't unusual for the annual festival. Maisel said up to 400,000 people had attended in past years.  Hundreds of people were pouring into the site at the same time from different directions, leading to a ""massive amount of congestion,"" he said. People tightly packed in a small area had fallen down a staircase and crushed each other, he added.  ""Overall they usually control the crowd, but at a certain point at the peak the crowd became too tight,"" Maisel said. ""It was simply tragic and horrific."" Social media video from the site show men and boys crammed into a narrow passageway, when it suddenly becomes clear that many are struggling to continue walking, being thrown back and forth in waves of the commotion. Zohar, one of the festival-goers who was near the crush when it happened, told Israel's Channel 12 News that people were moving through the passageway well until they came to a sudden stop.  ""Everyone was crammed on top of each other and no one understood why. I raised my head and saw policemen blocking the passageway. We shouted, 'People are dying in there.'"" He said he saw people losing the color in their faces. ""Then, bodies began falling at my feet. I tried to call for help, and slowly rescue forces arrived. There were some people who [rescuers] did not even try to revive. People were lying on my feet, shouting 'Help me.'"" Shlomo Katz, another worshiper, told Reuters: ""We were going to go inside for the dancing and stuff and all of a sudden we saw paramedics from MADA ... running by, like mid-CPR on kids, and then one after the other started coming out of ambulance, and then we understood something's going on here,"" he said.  Footage from the scene showed dozens of body bags lined up on the ground, and personal items like abandoned shoes and crushed eyeglasses lying scattered on the ground at the scene.  Dozens of ambulances parked in rows, their lights flashing, were on standby to receive the many injured. Authorities said 250 ambulances had been made available to respond. Six helicopters transferred some of the wounded to hospital. Paramedics were seen running all over the area, with stretchers carrying people in need of treatment. The local police chief told Israeli TV he accepted full responsibility for the incident.  ""I take overall responsibility, for good and for bad. I am ready for every eventuality,"" said Shimon Lavie, Israel Police's northern commander. He said Israel's northern police command had prioritized security and public safety, but he could not explain what caused the stampede.  Lavie commended police officers who tried to help victims before patients were ferried to hospitals in ambulances and by helicopter. ""Police were saving people's lives while they were also dealing with this complicated incident,"" he said.  Lazar Hyman, vice president of United Hatzalah, said it was one of the worst tragedies that he had ever experienced. ""I have not seen anything like this since I entered into the field of emergency medicine back in 2000,"" said Hyman. Prime Minister Netanyahu said the nation was praying for the injured in what he called ""one of the worst disasters that Israel has experienced."" Speaking during a visit to the site, on a specially-recorded video for his Facebook page, the Israeli leader said that ""our hearts are with the families and the wounded."" US President Joe Biden offered condolences to Israel and Netanyahu on Friday. ""The loss of life among worshipers practicing their faith is heartbreaking,"" Biden said in a statement. ""I have instructed my team to offer our assistance to the government and people of Israel as they respond to the disaster and care for the wounded.""  Each year, hundreds of thousands of Jews -- many of them ultra-Orthodox -- flock to Bar Yochai's tomb site on Mount Meron, which lies in the Upper Galilee region of northern Israel, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) northeast of the city of Haifa. Bar Yochai's book ""The Zohar"" is the foundation of Jewish mysticism.","{'neg': 0.313, 'neu': 0.491, 'pos': 0.196, 'compound': -0.2263}",50,192.0,0.16666666666666666,0.7866666666666666,0.04666666666666667,-0.7423,0.12,0.798,0.083,-0.9901,-37.114999999999995,-20.585157142857135,156.0,-0.13195613553113547

""We can confirm that multiple U.S. citizens were among the casualties,"" the spokesperson said, but did not provide details on numbers of wounded or how many were killed.  “The U.S. Embassy is working with local authorities to verify whether any additional U.S. citizens were affected, and is providing all possible consular support to affected U.S. citizens and their loved ones,” the spokesperson added. “Out of respect for the families at this difficult time, we have no further comment,” the spokesperson said.“We offer our sincerest condolences to the families and loved ones of those injured and who perished in the tragedy at Mt.

US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer addressed the tragic situation in Northern Israel saying they're trying to figure out if any New Yorkers or Americans were among the confirmed dead in the massive stampede yesterday.  ""It was horrible to see so many people die, and right now we're trying to find out, obviously, when any loss of human life, we feel it, but we're trying to find out if any are New Yorkers or Americans. We don't know the answer to that yet,"" Schumer said at a news conference in New York Friday morning. US Secretary of State Tony Blinken spoke with his Israeli counterpart on Friday to offer his condolences on the deadly incident at the religious festival at Mount Meron.

President Joe Biden offered condolences to Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Friday after a crush during a religious celebration at Mount Meron killed at least 45 worshippers Friday. “The loss of life among worshipers practicing their faith is heartbreaking. I have instructed my team to offer our assistance to the government and people of Israel as they respond to the disaster and care for the wounded,” Biden said in a statement. A crush during a a religious celebration at Israel's Mount Meron killed dozens of people Friday and injured more than 100 others. If you're just reading in now, here's what we know about the deadly crush: At least 45 dead during religious celebration: After a stampede broke out at Israel's Mount Meron, at least 45 people were killed and some 150 others were injured. Worshipers had gathered at the mountain to mark the Lag B'Omer holiday, an annual event where participants sing, dance and light fires in homage to second-century sage Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai at his burial site.
An investigation is ongoing: Israeli investigators are examining exactly how the crush happened at the mountain. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the incident a ""huge disaster,"" while paramedics described chaotic scenes of teams administering CPR en masse to people, including children, lying breathless on the ground.

Dov Maisel, vice president of operations of the volunteer-based emergency organization United Hatzalah, told CNN that around 100,000 people were in attendance. Jewish worshipers lingered at the holy site of Mount Meron on Friday trying to understand how the disaster unfolded.  The scene of the disaster is a stadium-style seating area used by Orthodox worshipers to light bonfires. The ramp leading down to the steps remains rather slippery following reports of water being sprayed at fleeing worshipers. A middle railing stretching down the ramp was left completely bent following the stampede. Eyewitness accounts from the night before are also helping to piece together the frenzy that ensued.  ""The passageway [where people were walking] was flowing fine, but suddenly everything stopped. Everyone was crammed on top of each other and no one understood why. I raised my head and saw policemen blocking the passageway. We shouted 'people are dying in there,'"" a festival-goer named Zohar told Israel's Channel 12 news.  ""People lost the color in their faces,"" Zohar said. ""Then, bodies began falling at my feet. I tried to call for help, and slowly rescue forces arrived. There were some people who [rescuers] did not even try to revive. People were lying on my feet, shouting 'Help me.'"" Another eyewitness named Tami was also critical of the police response.  “I was standing on the roof top there. They were spraying water because it was very hot, then they started slipping over, ten people slipping, then another ten, and another ten. I am still shocked and traumatised by it. I can't believe what I saw. They tried to move, to run away. They tried to get some space to breathe, but the police wouldn’t let them,"" Tami told Kan News.  ""I know the police were doing their job, and didn't realize what was happening behind them, but in the end, the result was unbelievable."" The Mount Meron stampede is ""one of the worst disasters that Israel has experienced"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said during a visit to the site. ""Our hearts are with the families and the wounded,"" he added, according to a specially recorded video for his Facebook page. The stampede took place during celebrations for the religious festival of Lag B'Omer in the early hours of Friday and has so far claimed the lives of 45 people, according to the Israeli Health Ministry. “There were heart-breaking scenes here,” Netanyahu said, referencing distressing images of “people who were crushed to death, including children.” A “large portion” of the victims have still not been identified, Netanyahu said, urging people to “desist from spreading rumors on social media because this will break the families’ hearts.” Netanyahu declared this coming Sunday “as a day of national mourning"" and asked people to “come together for the sake of the families and pray for the well-being of the wounded.  The Israeli authorities had advised participants not to make the annual pilgrimage to the town of Meron this year in light of Covid-19 risks. Netanyahu said a “thorough investigation” would be conducted to “ensure a disaster like this does not happen again.  The prime minister commended the efforts of the “very fast police rescue and operation” adding that we “owe them great thanks for preventing a much bigger disaster.” Tens of thousands of people gathered on Mount Meron on Thursday for Lag B'Omer, an annual Jewish religious festival marking the anniversary of the death of an influential rabbi who is believed to be buried there.  But the celebration turned into tragedy early on Friday, when at least 45 people were killed in a crush.  Here's a look at some of the scenes from Mount Meron from the last 24 hours: Scores of buses have been steadily making their way to Mount Meron to ferry people away from the disaster that unfolded during the Lag Ba-Omer festival. At one point on Friday, there was a line of buses that stretched back around 10 kilometers (6 miles), all waiting to travel up the mountain.  From the early hours of Friday morning to Friday afternoon, the buses were completely packed, demonstrating just how many people were in attendance at the event.  Around 100,000 people are thought to have gathered for the annual Lag Ba-Omer festival this year, according to Dov Maisel, vice president of operations of the volunteer-based emergency organization United Hatzalah, who added that those numbers aren't unusual. Up to 400,000 people had attended in past years, he said. Other attendees have started to make their way down by foot.  The Lag B'Omer festival is an annual Jewish religious holiday marking the anniversary of the death of an influential rabbi who died some 19 centuries ago. It is the largest annual public event held in Israel. Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai was a 2nd century sage and scholar who many maintain is the author of the Zohar, the seminal work which serves as the foundational text in Jewish mysticism.  Every year, Orthodox Jews travel in huge numbers to the town of Meron and celebrate by lighting bonfires and singing and dancing on Mount Meron, where the rabbi is believed to be buried, until the early hours of the morning.  Another key tradition sees parents bringing boys who have reached the age of 3 into Shimon Bar Yochai’s tomb for their very first haircut.  The festival was largely curtailed last year due to coronavirus restrictions.  Despite calls from the Israeli health ministry advising people not to come, huge crowds still flocked to Meron this year.  Usually only Orthodox Jews make the pilgrimage to Meron, although secular Jews across Israel participate by lighting bonfires.  Israeli Health Minister Yuli Edelstein said Friday that most people who had been taken to hospital after the crush at Mount. Meron “have been released and will be released during the day.” Speaking at Ziv hospital in the northern city of Safed, where 54 people injured in the crush had been sent, Edelstein said that the quick response by emergency services was “not a coincidence” as it followed Thursday’s annual exercises which prepared them for large scale disaster.  “When people were called to the hospital in the middle of the night, they were ready,” Edelstein said. Most of the injuries were broken bones resulting from the crush of the crowd, he said. Edelstein added that the health ministry had passed on “very clear instructions” regarding  coronavirus risks at the religious gathering to the police and the ministry of religious affairs. Israel's emergency service director General Eli Bin said on Friday that the Mount Meron crush is ""one of the most difficult civil disasters the State of Israel has ever known."" ""It is difficult to contain the magnitude of the disaster,"" Bin, who heads Israel's Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency service, added in a Friday statement.  Following the incident that killed dozens, the MDA provided medical care to 150 people, the statement said.  Bin said a complex security operation had been in place in preparation for the religious festival and that on Thursday morning they had participated in a large exercise led by  police.  “Yesterday morning we participated in a large exercise led by the Israel Police and did not imagine that we would find ourselves in such a complex and difficult event. All the forces acted quickly and with dedication in a very difficult and complex arena, in coordination and cooperation with all the factors,” Bin said in the statement. MDA paramedic Omri Hochman, who was one of the first to arrive to treat the injured, recalled the chaos: ""We arrived and there was a big commotion, dozens of people ran in our direction, they shouted at us where to go and told us that there were dozens of people injured. The sights were very difficult, dozens of wounded lay in a narrow corridor and next to it. Dozens more walked around suffering from various injuries. There were cries of pain, sighs and there were those who lost consciousness and needed resuscitation.""
Maor Atadgi, another MDA paramedic added: ""We rescued the injured from piles of people and performed resuscitation operations on people who were fatally wounded. Our large forces rescued the wounded, some to MDA clinics and some to ambulances. In all my years at MDA, I do not remember such a heavy disaster."" Every year, MDA forces are stationed at Mount Meron for the Lag B’Omer festival, with hundreds of ambulances, intensive care vehicles, motorcycles, ATVs and unique rescue vehicles and clinics adapted to secure the event, the MDA said.  Calls began to arrive on Friday morning at 12:49 a.m. local time for distressed casualties near the ""Toldot Aharon"" celebration, near the rabbi’s tomb in Meron, the statement said.  A “multi-casualty incident” was immediately declared and MDA forces from around the country were deployed, the statement concluded. Israeli attorney general Avichai Mandelblit said Friday that a probe has been opened into the Meron disaster, and that authorities are investigating whether there was any criminality attributable to the police. ""It was decided to start an investigation immediately as to whether there are criminal suspicions on the part of police officers as part of the disaster in Meron,"" the statement read.  Shimon Lavie, northern commander of Israel Police, said earlier on Friday that he took overall responsibility for the crush. “I take overall responsibility, for good and for bad. I am ready for every eventuality. The northern police command and transport section were ready for every eventuality. We had security and public safety at the top of the order of priorities,” Lavie told Israeli TV. “We are dealing with a lot of media and video which are not based in fact and have no connection to the reality. We are collecting evidence to get to the truth,"" Lavie said. Lavie added that “police were saving people’s lives, while they were also dealing with this complicated incident.” Mandelblit said Friday that Israel Police will not at this stage collect testimonies from the officers involved in the incident as part of the ongoing investigation. The attorney general and the acting state attorney will conduct additional situation assessments and make appropriate decisions based on the progress of the investigation, led by the justice ministry's police internal investigations department.   The National Center of Forensic Medicine (Abu Kabir) in Tel Aviv said that they are prepared to receive the dead and are able to receive and assist families who will coming to identify their loved ones.  The institute added that social workers from the relevant ultra-Orthodox authorities and Yiddish speakers will be present, according to a statement posted by the health ministry.   The institute said it is working to complete the identification process as quickly as possible and with increased staffing, adding that the process of transferring the bodies to the institute has already begun. Volunteer EMT Kalanit Taub, a first responder at the scene, told CNN there was “non-stop people to care for"" in the wake of the crush. Taub described place where the crush occurred as a ""horrific scene,"" and said that there were people giving CPR everywhere she looked.  “Literally, I saw twenty-plus CPRs ongoing at the same time,” Taub said.
“Anywhere you looked, you saw another person doing CPR … it was just nonstop one after another.” She added that a paramedic next to her was declaring person after person dead.  Taub, who is also a member of a psychological trauma treatment unit, said she also took care of nearly 100 people in the aftermath of Friday’s incident in addition to performing CPR. “I was walking around the site for a number of hours afterwards and there were people on the side crying or just staring into space and I helped them process what they were dealing with,"" she said.  “They didn’t know how to cope with what they had just seen,” she said.  Taub recalled how the religious gathering went from a joyous occasion to a disaster very quickly.  “In seconds it went from a site where people were singing and joyous, to mass chaos, pandemonium and death,” she said. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted about the crush on Friday morning, describing it a ""huge disaster."" ""We are all praying for the well-being of the injured. I want to strengthen the hand of those carrying out rescue efforts and who are operating on site,"" Netanyahu said.  Lazar Hyman, vice president of United Hatzalah, said it was one of the worst tragedies that he had ever experienced. ""I have not seen anything like this since I entered into the field of emergency medicine back in 2000,"" said Hyman. Israeli investigators are examining what caused a crush that killed at least 44 worshipers at a mass religious gathering in Mount Meron overnight. Thousands of worshipers had crowded onto the mountain burial site to celebrate the Lag B'Omer holiday, an annual event to pay homage to second-century Mishnaic sage Rabbi Shim Bar Yochai. But in the early hours of Friday morning, singing and dancing erupted into chaos, as a huge wave of people trapped others beneath them, including children, witnesses told Reuters. ""We were going to go inside for the dancing and stuff and all of the sudden we saw paramedics from MADA running by, like mid-CPR on kids, and then one after the other started coming out,"" said Shlomo Katz. Another attendee, Wice Israel, said he saw people falling to the ground. ""It was crowded and there were there around 60,000 to 70,000 people, no place to move, and people started to fall to the ground, a lot fell to the ground,"" he said. Dov Maisel from the volunteer-based emergency organization United Hatzalah told CNN that an estimated 50,000 to 100,000 people had been on the mountain. He said thousands of people tightly packed in a small area had fallen down a staircase and crushed each other. ""Overall they usually control the crowd, but at a certain point at the peak the crowd became too tight,"" Maisel said.","{'neg': 0.451, 'neu': 0.265, 'pos': 0.283, 'compound': -0.2263}",136,193.0,0.16599999999999998,0.7185714285714286,0.1152857142857143,-0.35022857142857144,0.155,0.747,0.098,-0.9997,-47.63108571428572,-75.52128571428571,265.0,-0.28498598382749324
Dozens of Palestinians injured in police clashes as Jewish extremists chanting 'Death to Arabs' march in Jerusalem,2021-04-23,"Clashes between Palestinians from east Jerusalem and Israeli police around the Damascus gate entrance to the Old City erupted in a night of unrest that earlier saw Jewish extremists marching through another city street shouting ""Death to Arabs.""   The violence marks a high point so far in a new phase of complex heightened tensions in the city which began a week and half ago around the start of Ramadan, and prompted an unusual statement Friday morning from the US embassy in Jerusalem in which it called on ""all responsible voices [to] promote an end to incitement."" Hundreds of Palestinians gathered in the area around the Damascus gate Thursday evening to protest the closure of the plaza space in front of the gate, a popular place for young Palestinians to hang out, especially during Ramadan.  Glass bottles and rocks were thrown at police, who used stun grenades, rubber bullets and water cannons spraying foul-smelling 'skunk water,' in an effort to disperse the crowds.  At one point, a group of young men managed to break down a pole with a security camera mounted on top and set it alight, temporarily creating a barricade.  The Palestinian Red Crescent said 105 Palestinians were injured, of which 22 required treatment in hospital.  Close by, police used barricades of their own to prevent a march by hundreds of supporters of the Jewish extremist 'Lehava' movement from reaching the same area.   Videos on social media show hundreds of people marching down one of Jerusalem's main thoroughfares, Jaffa Street, towards Damascus Gate chanting repeatedly ""Death to Arabs.""   Israeli media reports Lehava supporters threw rocks at police, and videos on social media show police water cannon being used to disperse them.  Lehava has been emboldened by the recent election to the Israeli parliament of several extremist-racist politicians, all of whom have been openly courted by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in his ongoing attempts to form a new government.  Tensions have been heightened further by a number of videos posted to Tik Tok over the last couple of weeks apparently showing acts of assault, including one purporting to show a Palestinian youth slapping two religious Jews riding the city's light rail tram service.  The violence continued well into Friday morning with incidents reported across the city, including one captured on video apparently showing Palestinian youths repeatedly kicking a Jewish man in east Jerusalem as he lies on the ground attempting to protect his head.  Another video appears to show religious Jewish youths attacking an Arab family house throwing sticks and other objects into the compound while a baby can be heard screaming.  Police say twenty of their officers were injured, three of whom were taken to hospital.   There were 44 arrests, police say.  In a noteworthy development, the US embassy issued a statement Friday morning, in English, Hebrew and Arabic, which said, ""We are deeply concerned about the incidents of violence in Jerusalem over the last several days. We hope all responsible voices will promote an end to incitement, a return to calm, and respect for the safety and dignity of everyone in Jerusalem.""","{'neg': 0.306, 'neu': 0.694, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.765}",17,194.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.086,0.828,0.085,-0.8176,0.0,-78.81928571428571,272.0,-0.2897767857142857
Biden hosts global climate change summit on Earth Day,2021-04-21,"President Biden joined dozens of world leaders today as part of a two-day virtual summit to address the global climate crisis.   Here were some of the notable developments from the summit: Global call to action: Biden asked world leaders to take action to combat climate change collectively as he announced an aggressive new goal for greenhouse gas emissions. Biden pointed to actions the US would take, an effort to reassert US leadership and put the US back to the center of the global effort to address the climate crisis after the Trump administration largely disengaged. “The signs are unmistakable, the science is undeniable that the cost of inaction, it just keeps mounting. The United States isn’t waiting. We are resolving to take action, not only our federal government, but our cities and our states all across our country, small businesses, large corporations, American workers in every field,” he said.
Cut emissions: Biden committed the United States to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 50%-52% below its 2005 emissions levels by 2030. Officials said Biden and his team arrived at the final number in a meeting at the White House on Wednesday morning. While the goals are a part of the Paris climate agreement that Biden rejoined upon taking office, they are non-binding and the administration has not rolled out a plan on how the US will meet them. 
More funds needed: Brazil's environment minister, Ricardo Salles, said Thursday that for Brazil to enforce its plan to reduce deforestation and carbon emissions by 2030 it will need more funds for resources. “Brazil presented to the United States, about a month ago, and at their request, an action plan so that in 12 months, if there are resources, it could move quickly towards reversing deforestation,"" Salles said in a news conference after President Jair Bolsonaro’s speech at the virtual summit to discuss climate issues convened by Biden.
Trying to make history: Europe wants to be “the first climate-neutral continent in the world,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said during Thursday's climate summit. “Yesterday, we agreed Europe's first-ever Climate Law with the European Parliament and our 27 governments. With this, we write into stone the goal set out by the European Green Deal – to make Europe climate-neutral by 2050,” von der Leyen said.
Celebrating Earth Day: As 40 world leaders convened for Biden's virtual climate summit, Pope Francis appealed for the world to “take care of the biodiversity, take care of nature” in a video message on Earth Day. Speaking in Spanish, Francis spoke about the Covid-19 pandemic and the impact on nature and climate change it had when the world “stopped.”  Both “global catastrophes” – climate change and Covid-19 — “demonstrate that we have no longer time to waste,"" he said. Special presidential envoy for climate John Kerry was complimentary of comments made by both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro at Thursday’s Climate Summit. However, he said the most important aspect is whether both countries follow through on their promises. “Some of the comments that President Bolsonaro made today surprised me for they’re- that’s pretty good, that works, if you do those things. The question is will they do them? And the question is what’s the follow through and enforcement,” Kerry said. On Putin, Kerry said he thought he was “pretty rational and put some decent visionary thoughts on things.” Asked whether he plans to visit Russia or Brazil, Kerry said “at some point travel will be warranted” but said more negotiations on climate need to happen first. Putin this morning said that Russia is “genuinely interested” in global cooperation. “I think there’s room to hopefully have a discussion about this and we’ll see if we can find some common ground. I think that’s the most important summary of what I heard in terms of their comments today,” Kerry concluded. Special presidential envoy for climate John Kerry offered a rebuttal to countries who may be wary of the US seeking to reemerge as a global leader on climate. “In the course of the last month, first question out of people’s mouths was, ‘What are you guys going to do? You destroyed your credibility, left the Paris Agreement, how can we trust you? What’s going to happen in the next four years?’"" he said in remarks from the White House briefing room Monday. The answer, Kerry said, is that “no politician could change what is now happening globally in the marketplace,” going on to cite financial commitments toward the administration’s goal. Kerry recalled signing the Paris Climate Accords five years ago today and lamented actions from the Trump administration pulling out of the historic agreement. “Regrettably, without any facts, without any science, without any rationale that would be considered reasonable, the former president decided to pull out. He was the only president in the entire world the only chief of state in the entire world who, without any scientific evidence, decided to pull out of the Paris Agreement,” Kerry said. That presented a challenge as Biden took office, Kerry said. “We had to restore America’s credibility, we had to prove we were serious, and I think that today does that in many ways, and not in a chauvinistic – in a way that is sort of inappropriate to our relationship with other countries, but in a way that reinforces the fact that … we need to bring all the countries in the world to the table, we all need to raise ambition,” he said. Brazil's environment minister, Ricardo Salles, said Thursday that for Brazil to enforce its plan to reduce deforestation and carbon emissions by 2030 it will need more funds for resources. “Brazil presented to the United States, about a month ago, and at their request, an action plan so that in 12 months, if there are resources, it could move quickly towards reversing deforestation,"" Salles said in a news conference after President Jair Bolsonaro’s speech at the virtual summit to discuss climate issues convened by US President Biden. ""The resources would go to the economic part and the command and control part of the plan in which will participate Ibama (environmental agency) and Federal Police, in addition to teams from the National Force and logistics with the support of the Armed Forces. It is also necessary to count on the state police,"" he said. Salles said the government budget for implementation of the plan will be presented next week and it will be higher than the current one. ""The president is going to double the resource, this is important because it gives support to the teams of the National Force, which can increase substantially,"" he said.  Bolsonaro’s new environment plan, according to Salles, has five axes and includes land regularization, payment of environmental services, bioeconomics, ecological-economic zoning, and increased inspection through the National Force, a police force that is not structured to fight environmental illegalities. The environment ministry reaffirmed what Bolsonaro said during his speech at the US Climate Summit, that Brazil will eliminate illegal deforestation by 2030 and neutralize greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. As US President Biden engages in a two-day virtual climate summit with world leaders, the fracking industry in Pennsylvania is reminding him of their importance to reach his climate goals.  In a letter to the White House Wednesday, the Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry, Pennsylvania Manufacturers Association, Pittsburgh Works, and the Marcellus Shale Coalition are calling on the administration to “promote policies reflecting the essential role American natural gas plays in this endeavor.”  “The workers and local small businesses driving the economy and helping to build America back are essential to a low-carbon future which cannot be achieved without an affordable and reliable source of clean energy. Natural gas is, and should continue to be, the key to our country’s environmental progress,” the letter states. In his first days in office, Biden ordered a moratorium on new oil and gas leases on federal land and water areas. However, the move was a far cry from the ban on fracking President Trump claimed Biden would initiate. Fracking – or the drilling for natural gas — supports an estimated 30,000 jobs in Pennsylvania, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Natural gas, along with solar and wind energy, is needed in order to advance climate and economic goals, according to the letter. “Domestically, a clean, reliable and resilient power grid based on natural gas and renewable energy sources working together is the only technologically feasible way of affordably meeting your climate goals for a carbon-free electrical grid by 2035 and net-zero emissions by 2050,” the letter states.   Today is Earth Day, and 40 world leaders are meeting virtually to discuss climate issues in a summit convened by US President Biden.  Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping are two notable leaders attending the summit, underscoring the wide range of leaders attending. Many allies of the US are also in attendance, including French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The US is the world's second-biggest polluter behind China, which has said it will continue to increase carbon emissions through at least the end of the decade.  CNN correspondent Fred Pleitgen reports on the latest from Moscow and answers questions about the summit.  Watch: CNN's Kate Sullivan and Kevin Liptak contributed reporting to this post. The virtual climate summit hosted by US President Biden cannot be “some expensive politically correct green act of ‘bunny hugging’” and must be about “growth and jobs,” British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Thursday. Praising the UK’s efforts on reducing carbon emissions, Johnson said, “We were the first country to pass legislation for net zero. We have the biggest offshore wind capacity of any country in the world, the Saudi Arabia of wind as I never tire of saying. We’re halfway to net zero.” “We have carbon emissions lower than at any point since the 19th century, we’re ending support for fossil fuels overseas and doubling our international climate finance. We’re actually speeding up because we see the obligations for developed countries to do more, we’re legislating to deliver 78% of the reductions needed to reach that goal by 2035,” he added. “As host of COP26, we want to see similar ambitions around the world and we’re working with everybody, from the smallest nations to the biggest emitters to secure commitments that will keep change to within 1.5 degrees. (…) It’s going to mean the richest nations coming together and exceeding the $100 billion commitment that they already made in 2009 and I stress how important that is,” Johnson also said. The UK will host the 26th UN Climate Change Conference in November 2021 in Glasgow, Scotland. Johnson also thanked Biden “for returning the United States to the front rank of the fight against climate change.” Alok Sharma, the president of the UN COP26 climate summit, has urged nations to “come forward and explain” how they will achieve their targets on reducing net greenhouse gas emissions.   ""This is an issue for China, it’s an issue indeed for all countries to come forward and explain how, having set targets for the middle of the century, how we’re actually going to get there,” Sharma told CNN on Thursday.  “It’s important that countries set out their plans in detail and that’s of course what we also want to see,” he added. He said he was “absolutely delighted” to have US President Biden “leading from the front” on climate, adding that “the nationally determined contributions set out by the [US] President is a big step up and I think it’s a benchmark, it’s for others as well the big emitters, to have a look at and see what more they can do.” Sharma said the world was “in a different place” to where it was about a year ago, adding, “The reality is that we’ve made progress in the last year. We now got 75% of the world economy covered by net-zero targets. But we need to do a lot more, in terms of near-term emission reduction targets and that’s what I’m looking for between now and COP26.” The 26th UN Climate Change Conference will take place in November 2021, at the Scottish Event Campus (SEC) in Glasgow, Scotland. As 40 world leaders convene for US President Biden's virtual climate summit, Pope Francis appealed for the world to “take care of the biodiversity, take care of nature” in a video message on Earth Day.  Speaking in Spanish, Francis spoke about the Covid-19 pandemic and the impact on nature and climate change it had when the world “stopped.”  Both “global catastrophes” – climate change and Covid-19 — “demonstrate that we have no longer time to waste."" “This shows us that the global nature needs our lives in the planet. It involved all of us, even if in many ways, different and unequivocal. And in this way, it teaches us even more on what we have to do to create a just planet, fair and safe from an environmental point of view. In brief, the Covid pandemic has taught us this interdependence, this sharing together the planet,” the Pope said.   The world “needs to reverse course” on climate as actions taken since the Paris agreement have “proven insufficient,” Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said on Thursday. “In the Paris agreement, we pledged to limit global warming to 1.5 degree Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels. But the actions we have taken since have proven insufficient. Under current policies, we are set to achieve 3 degrees of global warming. We need to reverse course, and do it soon,"" Draghi said while speaking at the Global Leaders Summit hosted by US President Biden on the occasion of Earth Day. “Italy is my own country, it is a beautiful but fragile country. The fight against climate change is a fight for our history and our landscapes,” he added.  With Italy holding the current presidency of the G20, which accounts for 75% of global emissions, Draghi said the group has a “special responsibility” to “deliver on the objectives of the Paris Agreement.” “We want to act now, not to regret it later,” he said. “The Italian presidency has proposed to hold a joint Climate and Energy Ministerial Meeting. A strong resolve by the G20 will also boost the chances for a successful COP26 Conference in Glasgow,” he added.  The 26th UN Climate Change Conference is scheduled to take place in Nov. 2021, at the Scottish Event Campus (SEC) in Glasgow, Scotland.  Draghi also thanked President Biden for his “leadership” in hosting the summit. “Now we are confident that together we will win this challenge,” he said.   US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen built off President Biden’s remarks on finance as key to combating climate change as she addressed world leaders Thursday. “We need a sprinting start now if we wish to achieve our goal of net-zero emissions by mid-century. President Biden has recommitted the United States in its part to tackle this crisis and marshal the full capacity of the US government. As Treasury Secretary, I understand that finance – public and private – is crucial to enable countries to accelerate their progress,” she said. Yellen cited “two questions that keep me up at night,” including how nations can reduce emissions by supporting economic development and responding to other challenges like Covid-19.  The second question, she said, is how should governments target public sector climate finance to mobilize private sector investments, noting that “past efforts to support private investment have not achieved anywhere near the scale needed to green the global economy."" She vowed that her department “will focus the full range of our tools and expertise to work with you in producing concrete and innovative answers to these questions.” She outlined key items in the President’s discretionary funding request to address this, including $1.2 billion request for the green climate fund, $485 million in funding to support multilateral climate initiatives, and increased support for multilateral development banks. Yellen said the US Treasury will work to facilitate investment in projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions via technical assistance to counterparts in other countries. The US is also working with the G20 on a sustainable finance working group to establish a sustainable finance roadmap for investors, she said. She again called for a global partnership in meeting the moment. “We will only achieve our goal of curtailing climate change through collective action. Today, we, as a global community, need to be ambitious, set goals, work together, and sprint toward a cleaner, safer, better future. We look forward to meeting this challenge together,” she concluded. US President Biden’s summit today could be a game changer for climate change, according to the Secretary-General of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said, an influential international policy organization.  José Ángel Gurría told CNN that “it’s completely turning the expectations around, and now with the United States leading the charge rather than holding everything back, this is the big game changer, and with China joining in, we have the second largest emitter of CO2, then that will really change the game.”  Speaking to CNN International's Julia Chatterley on First Move, Angel Gurría stressed the need “to convince the leaders, convince ourselves, that this is the single most important priority that we have in the long term, but the long term starts today.” He also addressed the Covid-19 crisis, saying the world is underfunding the fight against the virus. Angel Gurría said “it would be “a tragedy if we actually had the availability of the vaccines, and we did not have enough funding to be able to provide them to the least developed countries in the world.”   Europe wants to be “the first climate-neutral continent in the world,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said during Thursday's climate summit. “Yesterday, we agreed Europe's first ever Climate Law with the European Parliament and our 27 governments. With this, we write into stone the goal set out by the European Green Deal – to make Europe climate-neutral by 2050,” von der Leyen said. On Wednesday, the EU announced its target of reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels, as part of its Climate Law. Von der Leyen announced that the Commission would table proposals in June to make Europe “fit for 55.” “We will make emission trading work – not only for energy generation and industry – but also for transport and for buildings. Carbon must have its price – because nature cannot pay the price any longer,” she said. She also praised US President Biden for hosting the climate Summit. “It is so good to have the US back on our side in the fight against climate change. Together, we can go faster and get further. Together, we will win the future,” she said. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry said the creation of a net-zero economy will require a strong public-private partnership, noting that “governments alone cannot possibly find all the necessary investment” to meet the task of a net-zero carbon future.  “Creating a net-zero economy and doing it as rapidly as possible is an enormous challenge,” Kerry said in remarks at the opening of the second session of the Leaders’ Climate Summit hosted by the White House Thursday. “It will require mobilizing finance at an absolutely unprecedented level, and it will require governments to help facilitate the net-zero transition around the world, and to help … the vulnerable countries, the people who just don't have the finance or the technology or the ability to do this,” he said. “Given the magnitude of this challenge, however, governments alone cannot possibly find all the necessary investment,” Kerry added. “There’s no government in the world that has enough … in their budgets to be able to provide what we need to make this transition.” “Ultimately, how governments, international financial institutions and private providers of capital work together is really going to determine the outcome of this challenge,” Kerry said.   In his second set of remarks at the climate summit, President Biden outlined the case for global cooperation in the fight against climate change through an economic lens. Much like the first portion of the virtual summit, there were technical issues at the top, with Biden’s remarks echoing as he spoke for the first four minutes of a six-minute speech.  “Every nation has responsibility, and every nation is at risk… Instability and displacement in one country can have ripple effects that are felt throughout regions and across the world. Taking on climate change together is more than just the right thing to do, it’s also in everyone’s best interest to do it. Meeting this challenge is going to require mobilizing financing at an unprecedented scale,” he said, pointing to investment from the private sector. Governments, he said, need to lead in ""making sure that real material climate risks to financial systems are measured, disclosed and mitigated.” The response, he added, is “about international security, regional stability, food security, and gender and racial equality.” Mobilizing against the threat of climate change, Biden told the world leaders, is “an investment that’s going to pay significant dividends.” As part of the Biden administration’s commitment to have the US lead on this issue, he announced the US will double its annual public climate financing development to developing countries by 2024. The US also intends to triple public financing for climate application in developing countries by 2024.  He noted the Development Finance Corporation is also committing to net zero emissions in its investment portfolio by 2040, and has increased climate focused investments to 33% of all new investments beginning in 2023, which, Biden said, is “the earliest of any country.” Biden reiterated the “urgency” of the moment as he concluded.  “Good ideas and good intentions aren't good enough. We need to ensure that the financing will be there, both public and private, to meet the moment on climate change and to help us seize the opportunity for good jobs, strong economies, and a more secure world,” he said. Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro appeared to moderate his tone on environmental issues at Thursday's virtual climate summit. Bolsonaro reconfirmed his goal to eliminate illegal deforestation in the country by 2030, stating his government is strengthening environmental agencies, which goes in the opposite direction of the actions taken so far by his Environmental ministry.  Bolsonaro called on the international community to provide funding to help conserve the Amazon.  ""We coincide, Mr. President (Biden), with your call to establish ambitious commitments. In this sense, I have determined that our climate neutrality is to be achieved by 2050. Anticipating the previous goal in 10 years,"" he said. ""Among the necessary measures for achieving this, I highlight here the commitment to eliminate illegal deforestation by 2030. With that, we will reduce our emissions (of greenhouse gas) by almost 50% until that date."" Bolsonaro asked for international funding to help to conserve the Amazon. “Given the magnitude of the obstacles, including financial ones, it is essential to be able to count on the contribution of countries, companies, entities and people willing to act immediately, real and constructively in the solution of these problems. This year, the international community will have a unique opportunity to cooperate with the construction of our common future,"" said. Bolsonaro claimed the Amazon region needs to be developed economically. ""The solution to this Amazonian paradox is an essential condition for the sustainable development of the region,"" he said said, arguing that Brazil has little contribution to climate change. ""We cannot forget the main cause of the problem: the burning of fossil fuels over the past two centuries. Brazil participated with less than 1% of the historic emissions of greenhouse gases, even though it is one of the largest economies in the world,"" he continued.  Some more background: Traditionally one of the first country's to speak at world climate meetings, Brazil was one of the last to speak at this time. Bolsonaro's words came in line with a letter sent to President Biden last week, in which he vowed to work towards a zero deforestation rate in 2030 in Brazil. Despite Bolsonaro's speech, deforestation in Brazil remains on the rise. The environmental agencies Ibama and ICMBio are facing a lack of resources and public servants, with military personnel in technical positions and with less authority to supervise.  Read more about Bolsonaro's past stances on climate here.  All nations need to ""move more quickly"" on their climate commitments and ""2030 is the new 2050,"" French President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday. Speaking at the US-hosted virtual climate summit, Macron said: “There is only one goal for the coming weeks and months: to move more quickly."" “We need to move more quickly to implement commitments for 2030. A plan of action that is clear, measurable and verifiable. Basically, 2030 is the new 2050,” he added.  He also said countries should move more quickly on climate justice and on protecting biodiversity.  “Taking action for the climate means regulating, and regulating at international level. If we don’t set a price for carbon, there will be no transition,” he said. President Macron also welcomed US President Biden's commitment to cut his country's greenhouse gases by as much as 52% below its 2005 emissions levels by 2030, calling it a “historic decision on the road to Glasgow.” The 26th UN Climate Change Conference will take place in November 2021 at the Scottish Event Campus (SEC) in Glasgow, Scotland. President Biden announced a new pledge this morning to slash the country’s carbon emissions by between 50% and 52% by the year 2030, compared to 2005 levels.  That’s a big jump from the 26% to 28% reduction by 2025 that then-President Barack Obama announced he was aiming for when he joined the Paris agreement in 2015. How do these new targets compare to what other advanced economies are doing to curb global warming? When using 2005 emissions levels as a baseline, the US’ new target now puts it among the top-four most ambitious 2030 pledges globally, according to a recent analysis by the Rhodium Group, a private data analytics firm.  The US pledge doesn’t quite match the UK’s 2030 goal to cut their emissions by 63%, but it is roughly on par with what other developed countries like the EU and Switzerland are aiming for, the analysis shows.  Since Rhodium’s analysis was published, the UK government announced it is aiming to slash the country’s emissions by 78% by 2035 compared to 1990 levels. But more importantly, are the US’ targets in line with holding warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius, the threshold above which scientists have warned the world will face even more dangerous climate change impacts. In its 2018 special report, the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said that global greenhouse gas emissions would need to fall by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 for the world to have a shot at holding warming to less than 1.5 degrees Celsius.  The US’ new 50% target would translate into a 47% reduction by 2030 when compared to a 2010 emissions baseline, according to Rhodium’s analysis – in other words, right in line with what the IPCC says is necessary to avert disastrous levels of global warming.   During a virtual meeting held on the same day the US is hosting a climate summit, Vice President Harris spoke about her role in addressing the ""acute and root causes of migration.""  She told those convened that “most people don’t want to leave home” and said that the question needs to be “why they had to leave home.” Harris pointed to issues in the region such storm damage, drought, food scarcity and a number of issues that relate to poverty, as factors that also need to be addressed as part of solving migration issues.  “We have to give people a sense of hope that help is on the way... that if they stay things will get better,"" she said.  Harris warned that the issue is complex, adding: “if it was easy it would have been solved a long time ago.”  Speaking to the round table, Harris said the group was convened to figure out the best way to work together on the issues and a “comprehensive strategy” that includes civil society, the private sector, foundations and international help.  “This initiative from my perspective must be relevant to the root issues of migration and the reasons people flee,” Harris concluded. Cutting greenhouse gas emissions has already been a key topic during today's US-hosted climate summit. President Biden committed the United States to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 50%-52% below its 2005 emissions levels by 2030.  Reducing the amount of CO2 and other greenhouse gases that is released into the atmosphere is crucial for limiting future temperature increases. That's because these gases accumulate in the atmosphere and stay there for a long time. Like a blanket —or the roof of a greenhouse — they trap in heat that would otherwise escape into space.  This causes temperatures on Earth to rise, which is linked to more extreme weather, ice melt and a rise in sea levels. The more greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere, the more the planet will warm. Climate scientists have estimated the amount of greenhouse gases we can still add to the atmosphere without breaching the critical threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius.  At the start of 2018, the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimated we have around 420 gigatons (billion tons) of CO2 left in this so-called carbon budget. If humans can avoid burning through that budget, scientists say there is about a two-in-three chance of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. A more recent estimate published in the journal Nature earlier this year, puts the figure at a range from 230 gigatons for a two-in-three chance of meeting the target to 670 gigatons for a two-in-three chance of missing it. The world produced roughly 34 gigatons of CO2 last year, which means the remaining carbon budget could last for just over six years, unless emissions start declining fast. President Biden today kicked off a virtual climate summit attended by 40 other world leaders by announcing an ambitious cut in greenhouse gas emissions as he looks to put the US back at the center of the global effort to address the climate crisis and curb carbon emissions. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping are two notable leaders who are attending President Biden's two-day summit, underscoring the wide range of leaders attending. Many allies of the US are also in attendance, including French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Here's a look at the world leaders the US invited to the summit:  Prime Minister Gaston Browne, Antigua and Barbuda

President Nguyễn Phú Trọng, Vietnam   German Chancellor Angela Merkel welcomed President Biden's commitment to cut his country's greenhouse gases by as much as 52% by 2030.   ''The national contribution of the United States for 2030 is a clear illustration of your ambitions and is a very clear and important message to the international community,” Merkel said on Thursday during a virtual climate summit of world leaders.  Merkel also welcomed the fact that the US is back to being a global partner in tackling climate change.  ''I am delighted to see that the United States is back — is back to work together with us in climate politics because there can be in no doubt about the world needing your contribution if we really want to fulfill our ambitious goals,"" the German leader said.  Merkel said that the world's commitment in tackling the climate crisis is ''a herculean task because this is nothing short of a complete transformation — a complete change of the way we do business, the way we work.”  She reiterated that Germany has already reduced its emissions by 40% — compared to 2019 — and said that the EU will be climate neutral by 2050.  'We want to have at least 55% less emissions by 2030 compared to 1990,” Merkel said. Mexico's President Andrés Manuel López Obrador will propose a new migration agreement between the countries of North and Central America this week, he announced on Sunday. His proposal would ask Central American migrants as well as Mexicans considering emigration to work across Mexico planting trees and crops for three years in return for an eventual six-month US work visa, López Obrador said in a video posted to his YouTube channel. Eventually, participants in the program should be able to apply for US citizenship, he said. The Mexican President plans to present the plan during Thursday's virtual Climate Summit, convened by President Biden. ""We could make an agreement and say: 'Let's see, we support you to plant your land. If you are going to plant coffee, if you are going to plant cocoa for three years, we support you for three years and even more, but after those three years, once you have your harvest, you already have the automatic right to a six-month work visa for the United States,"" López Obrador said from Palenque, in Chiapas. ""You'll go six months (to the US) and then you will return to your town. And then, three years after having your work visa, with good behavior, you already have the right to apply for your US citizenship,"" he added. Some background: Thousands of Central Americans have been driven northward by the economic pain of the pandemic and two devastating Category 4 hurricanes last year. The recent influx of migrants, especially unaccompanied minors, at the US southern border has overwhelmed the American government's resources in the last month. Biden's administration has asked Mexico, Honduras and Guatemala to tighten their borders and stem the flow of migrants, and has also placed around 28,000 radio ads in Latin America to discourage people from making the trip. Aiming to find in environmental reforestation a solution to the migration crisis, López Obrador's proposal would extend the existing Mexican government welfare program Sembrando Vida, or Sowing Life. The US is just one of the major polluters announcing new, more ambitious climate targets this week. A number of countries, including the United Kingdom and Japan, have also upped their goals.  The UK government announced on Tuesday it is aiming to slash the country's emissions by 78% by 2035 compared to 1990 levels. The government has previously made a commitment to reduce emissions in 2030 by at least 68% compared to 1990 levels. On Thursday, Japan followed the UK and said it would aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 46% in 2030 from its 2013 levels. Previously, it was targeting a 26% cut.  The European Union has reached an agreement on a new climate law on Wednesday, following marathon talks that lasted 14 hours. Under the law, the EU pledged to cut emissions by 55% below 1990 levels by 2030. Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged his country’s commitment to a “green development” at the global climate summit with US President Joe Biden and other world leaders. Xi reaffirmed China would achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, and to peak carbon emissions by 2030. Xi also announced China’s plan to limit the increase in coal consumption: “We will strictly control coal fired power generation projects. We will strictly limit the increase in coal consumption over the 14th 5-year-plan period, and phase it down in the 15th 5-year-plan period.” China will also promote joint efforts for green Belt and Road projects, Xi said.  “Green mountains are gold mountains. To protect the environment is to protect productivity, and to improve the environment is to improve productivity,” he said. Speaking about the need for global cooperation on climate, Xi said, “Not long ago the Chinese and US sides released a joint statement addressing the climate crisis. China looks forward to working with the international community including the US to jointly advance global environmental governance.” Watch:  President Biden announced an ambitious goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 50% from 2005 levels by 2030. “By maintaining those investments and putting these people to work, the United States sets out on the road to cut greenhouse gases in half — in half — by the end of this decade. That's where we're headed as a nation,” he said. While the goals are a part of the Paris climate agreement that Biden rejoined upon taking office, they are non-binding and the administration has not rolled out a plan on how the US will meet them.  Officials said Biden and his team arrived at the final number in a meeting at the White House on Wednesday morning. The figures were struck after lengthy consultations with government agencies, scientists, industry representatives, governors, mayors and environmental researchers. The move underscores the President's commitment to addressing the climate crisis and follows on his pledge to work with other countries to find joint solutions to global issues. Biden went on to call on world leaders to join him, setting up a key test of his administration’s ability to galvanize support on this issue. “No nation can solve this crisis on our own, as I know you all fully understand. All of us, all of us and particularly those of us who represent the world's largest economies, we have to step up. You know those that do take action and make bold investments of their people in clean energy future, will win the good jobs, tomorrow, and make their economies more resilient and more competitive,” he said. He set the forthcoming Glasgow UN climate conference on Nov. 1 as a key target for other countries to join him in laying out goals. Steps between now and the Glasgow conference, he said, “will set the world up for success.” Biden called addressing climate change, which he described as “the existential threat of our time,” a moral and economic “imperative” and said this is “a moment of extraordinary possibilities.” Watch:  President Biden kicked off the Leaders Summit on Climate Thursday with welcoming remarks, calling on the world leaders to take action to combat climate change collectively as he announced an aggressive new goal for greenhouse gas emissions. The first moments of Biden’s remarks, including the entirety of introductory remarks by Vice President Kamala Harris, were wracked with audio issues. The pool was unable to provide the summit live to television networks, a last-minute change, so reporters were reliant on a whitehouse.gov feed.  Biden pointed to actions the US would take, an effort to reassert US leadership and put the US back to the center of the global effort to address the climate crisis after the Trump administration largely disengaged. “The signs are unmistakable, the science is undeniable that the cost of inaction, it just keeps mounting. The United States isn’t waiting. We are resolving to take action, not only our federal government, but our cities and our states all across our country, small businesses, large corporations, American workers in every field,” he said. Biden focused on the job creation aspect of addressing the climate crisis in his remarks, suggesting he sees “an opportunity to create millions of good-paying middle class union jobs.” “When I talk about climate, I think jobs. Within our climate response lies an extraordinary job creation and economic opportunity ready to be fired up,” Biden said, going on to urge investment in infrastructure. “I want to build critical infrastructure to produce and deploy clean technology, both those we can harness today and those we will invent tomorrow,” he said. Harris made brief introductory remarks ahead of Biden, outlining how the leaders present share the common concern of climate change. “As a global community, it is imperative that we act quickly and together,” she said, calling for innovation and collaboration “around the world.” As President Biden commited the United States to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg told CNN it's now a matter of policy and not individual choices to make these goals a reality.  ""It's going to take a national effort but this is not a matter of something that can be done just by asking individual Americans to make individual choices. This is a matter of policy,"" he told CNN Thursday. Giving the example of electric vehicles, he said it won't take any sacrifice for Americans but policy needs to ensure that ""they're affordable, to make sure we have enough charging stations around the country, to make sure the electric vehicles of tomorrow are made in America on American soil by American workers, preferably American union workers."" In the larger picture, Buttigieg pointed out that the US is responsible for about 15% of the world's emissions. ""That's why it was so disastrous when the last administration basically left the US seat at the table empty. That's why it's so important today that we are convening,"" he added, saying that it's important that the country leads the way. ""We're looking for other countries to make big commitments as well. But we can't do that with a straight face if America isn't leading the way, if we're not walking the talk. That's what this big, bold but achievable commitment from the President today is going to help us do —resume that position of US Leadership and then challenge the other nations of the world to be part of the solution as well."" Watch:  Former Vice President and Nobel Laureate Al Gore praised the Biden Administration’s pledge on cutting US carbon emissions on Thursday, calling it “a ground-breaking step” and saying, “we have no more time to waste.” Gore noted that significant cuts are needed in this decade if we are to limit the global temperature rise and avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate change. “This ambitious goal is one that we must reach. I know that with the Biden Administration’s whole-of-government approach, paired with investments in green jobs and infrastructure under consideration in Congress, we can,” Gore said. In 2006, former VP Gore brought climate change to the forefront of global discussion with the Academy-Award winning film An Inconvenient Truth. Gore shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for their efforts to study and inform the global audience about the climate challenge. More on Biden's announcement: Biden committed the United States to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 50% to 52% below its 2005 emissions levels by 2030. While the goals are a part of the Paris climate agreement that Biden rejoined upon taking office, they are non-binding and the administration has not rolled out a plan on how the US will meet them.  President Biden just committed the United States to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 50%-52% below its 2005 emissions levels by 2030.  Officials said Biden and his team arrived at the final number in a meeting at the White House on Wednesday morning. While the goals are a part of the Paris climate agreement that Biden rejoined upon taking office, they are non-binding and the administration has not rolled out a plan on how the US will meet them.  In an address opening the summit, Biden laid out his vision for a greener economy in which climate change is taken seriously across all sectors and results in more jobs for the blue-collar workers he has focused on throughout his career. ""That's where we're headed as a nation, and that's what we can do if we take action to build an economy that's not only more prosperous but healthier, fairer and cleaner for the entire planet,"" Biden said. ""These steps will set America's economy to net-zero emissions by no later than 2050,"" he added. Biden also used his remarks to warn about the impacts of not acting on climate change.  ""The signs are unmistakable. The science is undeniable. But the cost of inaction, keeps mounting,"" Biden said. ""The United States is not waiting, we are resolving to take action."" Watch: President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are opening the inaugural session of the  ""Leaders Summit on Climate."" Biden is expected to announce an ambitious cut in greenhouse gas emissions as he looks to put the US back at the center of the global effort to address the climate crisis and curb carbon emissions. He will commit the United States to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 50%-52% below its 2005 emissions levels by 2030.  According to the schedule released by the State Department, the first session of the summit will ""underscore the urgent need for the world’s major economies to strengthen their climate ambition by the time of COP 26 to keep the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius within reach.""  Countries will also be able to highlight ""the climate-related challenges"" they face.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson, United Kingdom    President Biden will soon kick off a climate summit attended by 40 other world leaders by announcing an ambitious cut in greenhouse gas emissions as he looks to put the US back at the center of the global effort to address the climate crisis and curb carbon emissions. More on the US announcement: At the White House summit, which will take place virtually on Thursday and Friday, Biden will commit the United States to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 50%-52% below its 2005 emissions levels by 2030.  Officials said Biden and his team arrived at the final number in a meeting at the White House on Wednesday morning. The figures were struck after lengthy consultations with government agencies, scientists, industry representatives, governors, mayors and environmental researchers. The move underscores the President's commitment to addressing the climate crisis and follows on his pledge to work with other countries to find joint solutions to global issues. What the President will not unveil, at least right now, is a specific road map for how the United States will reach those targets, which are being described as ""economy-wide."" Key summit topics: The summit will focus on mobilizing public and private sector finance to reach net-zero emissions and ""build a resilient future,"" according to the official. The US plans to discuss investing in innovation, which the administration argues is critical to creating transformational technologies to reduce emissions and at the same time creates new economic opportunities. It's hoped that other countries will follow the US' lead with additional announcements of new goals to tackle the crisis, the administration official said. The leaders who have confirmed attendance: Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping are two notable leaders who have both confirmed their attendance at the summit, underscoring the wide range of leaders attending. The summit will also be attended by many allies of the US, including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Read more about the summit here.  President Biden hopes this week's event will place the US back at the fore of global efforts to combat climate change, after four years in which the issue was neglected.  While former President Trump frequently touted the cleanliness of American air and water, he took steps to roll back the carbon reduction efforts made by the Obama administration. A few months into his presidency, Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris climate agreement against the urging of top leaders, who said global unity on the issue was paramount. At a heated G7 summit held cliffside in Sicily, leaders like German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sought to use their first encounter with Trump to press him into remaining in the deal. But Trump refused, announcing in the Rose Garden he had been ""elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris."" White House officials insist progress on cutting emissions did not completely stop under Trump; instead it shifted to state and local governments, along with actions taken in the private sector. Indeed, after Trump declared he was looking out for Pittsburgh and not Paris, the mayor of Pittsburgh declared he would continue pressing ahead on reducing carbon emissions anyway. ""We're pretty close to being on the trajectory we said we would be on,"" a senior administration official said on Wednesday. ""The fact that the change in the administration led to a top-line view that it wasn't a priority didn't in fact effect a lot of the trajectory in the country."" Biden, who has already reentered the Paris deal, hopes to send a signal both to foreign leaders and an audience at home that he is adopting a different approach than the previous administration. As the world's most powerful leaders prepare to come together for President Biden's virtual climate summit, the Dalai Lama and 100 other Nobel Prize winners have a clear message for them: Keep fossil fuels in the ground. The 101 Nobel laureates have written to Biden and those attending the meeting on Thursday, urging them to take concrete steps to phase out fossil fuels in order to prevent catastrophic climate change. ""The burning of fossil fuels is responsible for almost 80% of carbon dioxide emissions since the industrial revolution,"" the letter, shared exclusively with CNN, says, adding: ""Allowing the continued expansion of this industry is unconscionable."" The signatories make it clear they believe it is up to the summit's attendees to act. ""Leaders, not industry, hold the power and have the moral responsibility to take bold actions to address this crisis,"" they said. The laureates outline three steps they say world leaders need to take:  Put an end to any further expansion of oil, gas and coal production
Phase out existing fossil fuel production in a manner that is fair and equitable 
Invest heavily in the global transition to renewable energy ""In addition to being the leading source of emissions, there are local pollution, environmental and health costs associated with extracting, refining, transporting and burning fossil fuels. These costs are often paid by Indigenous peoples and marginalized communities,"" the letter says. The letter, which was coordinated by the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative, has been signed by some of the world's most distinguished scientists, peace makers and writers. Known to favor a back-slap and handshake style, President Biden will be limited to a computer screen as he seeks to restore American credibility on the world stage while also convincing fellow leaders to make bold pledges to stave off global warming.  Officials said the logistics of a virtual summit made pull-asides or individual bilateral meetings difficult to organize, and Biden has found previous virtual meetings with foreign leaders somewhat stilted. This week's meeting is the largest virtual summit of world leaders to be convened over the past pandemic-altered year.  When he begins traveling abroad, potentially as soon as June, Biden is expected to continue pressing on climate issues leading up to a major summit in Scotland in November. The urgency of the matter was underscored this week in a new report from the International Energy Agency, which estimated carbon emissions from energy use are on track to spike by 1.5 billion tons in 2021 as heavy coal consumption in Asia – China, in particular – outweigh rapid growth in renewable sources.  That would be the second largest annual increase in energy-related emissions in history. President Biden will commit the United States to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 52% as he convenes world leaders for a climate summit on Thursday. The new target, long anticipated as a signal of the new president’s commitment to fighting climate change, will actually be a range: a 50%-52% cut of 2005 emissions levels by 2030. Officials said Biden and his team arrived at the final number in a meeting at the White House on Wednesday morning.  The figures were struck after lengthy consultations with government agencies, scientists, industry representatives, governors, mayors and environmental researchers. What the President will not unveil, at least right now, is a specific road map for how the United States will reach those targets, which are being described as “economy-wide.” Officials described “multiple pathways” for the US to arrive at the goal, and said the President’s climate task force would release sector-by-sector recommendations later this year on achieving the necessary cuts. “Achieving that target is something we can do in multiple ways,” a senior administration official said a day ahead of the announcement.  “In the coming months you will continue to see from the administration a focus on driving forward the necessary actions that unlock the jobs opportunity that tacking the climate crisis presents,” the official said.  Indeed, Biden is expected to focus heavily on the potential economic boon that fighting climate change could present. His critics have described attempts to move the country away from fossil fuel as job-killers. But Biden hopes to highlight the opportunities that would come along with overhauling technology to make it cleaner. “There is only one playbook that works in this moment and that playbook is you chase after the economic opportunity that tacking the climate crisis presents and we’re doing that,” the official said.  Officials said they conducted a “techno-economic” analysis across various sectors — including electricity, transportation, buildings, industry, lands and oceans — to identify various pathways for reducing emissions in each one. That included the potential for new standards and incentives that would limit greenhouse gasses.  Read more about the announcement here.  In December 2020, before officially taking office, President Biden announced his climate team. It was a historic display of the then-President-elect's effort to prioritize his administration's response to the climate crisis. ""I'm pleased to announce a team that will lead my administration's ambitious plan to address the existential threat of our time, climate change,"" Biden said at the time. On his first day in office, Biden took executive actions to rejoin the Paris Climate Accord, cancel the Keystone XL pipeline and direct agencies to review and reverse more than 100 Trump actions on the environment. Just a week later, Biden signed several more executive actions related to the climate crisis, including one directing the secretary of the interior to pause on entering into new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or offshore waters. Since the early days of his administration, Biden and other administration officials have emphasized that the White House is taking a ""whole of government"" approach to climate change.  They've also underscored that they believe the President's actions will help spur job growth, and categorize people working in industries vulnerable to job loss, such as coal miners, under their umbrella of environmental justice. ""It's about coming to the moment to deal with this maximum threat that we exist with as now facing us, climate change, with a greater sense of urgency,"" he said at a January signing ceremony. ""In my view, we've already waited too long to deal with this climate crisis. We can't wait any longer."" Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin confirmed they are attending the US-hosted two-day virtual summit on climate. The White House said a total of 40 world leaders were invited to the conference, which will be live streamed to the public. ""President Biden took action his first day in office to return the United States to the Paris Agreement. Days later, on January 27, he announced that he would soon convene a leaders summit to galvanize efforts by the major economies to tackle the climate crisis,"" the White House said in a statement. ""The Leaders Summit on Climate will underscore the urgency — and the economic benefits — of stronger climate action. It will be a key milestone on the road to the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) this November in Glasgow,"" it continued.  On the campaign trail, Biden made climate change a central issue, setting a goal of ensuring that the US achieves net-zero emissions by 2050. He signed several executive actions his first week in office related to the climate crisis, including one directing the secretary of the interior to pause on entering into new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or offshore waters. The President and other administration officials have emphasized that the White House is taking a ""whole of government"" approach to climate change. They've also underscored that they believe the President's actions will help spur job growth, and categorize people working in industries vulnerable to job loss, such as coal miners, under their umbrella of environmental justice. The event marks the first time since former President Barack Obama left office that the US has taken the lead on climate change issues. President Donald Trump pulled the US out of the Paris Climate Accord and was often publicly skeptical that global warming was a real phenomenon.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",332,195.0,0.008,0.951,0.041,0.8176,0.042,0.839,0.118,1.0,271.4432,186.6971142857143,560.0,0.33338770408163265
America's enemies line up to put Biden to the test,2021-04-14,"The world already seems more dangerous and complex than when Joe Biden took office less than three months ago. That's partly because America's adversaries are putting the new commander in chief to the test. The United States is being drawn into great power confrontations with China and Russia. Iran plans to enrich uranium to higher levels than ever before after an attack on one of its nuclear plants widely attributed to Israel. North Korea is back to testing ballistic missiles. And Biden's plan to end the ""forever war"" in Afghanistan by this year's 20th anniversary of 9/11 has critics warning the Taliban could crush the weak US-allied government in Kabul. The limits on a President's power meanwhile have been underscored by a violent coup in Myanmar that US sanctions and condemnation have done nothing to thwart. The building crises will dominate two days of congressional hearings beginning Wednesday involving chiefs of intelligence agencies that balked at public testimony last year to avoid humiliating ex-President Donald Trump by contradicting his conspiratorial worldview. In an Annual Threat Assessment ahead of the hearings, the espionage community added another helping of challenges to Biden's plate -- predicting destabilizing cross-border migratory surges and toppled governments in the geopolitical aftershocks of the pandemic. And it said Beijing and Moscow were exploiting the discord to bolster their power. It is a daunting set of worsening problems for a President who has made no secret that his priority is defeating the virus, reviving the US economy and forging a foreign policy designed around the needs of the American worker. Recent events show that Biden will not have the luxury of a mostly domestic focus. Speeches and diplomatic blueprints from new administrations are great in theory. But US foes rarely comply with the neat assessments by Washington foreign policy planners of how they will behave. China and Russia are feeling out Biden's limits It's not unusual for there to be a sense that America's adversaries are probing a new president. Moscow's massive troop build-up on Ukraine's borders and China's probing of Taiwan's defenses may fit into this category -- and isolated North Korea always seeks to get a new commander in chief's attention. Biden's hopes of reviving a nuclear deal with Iran may already be on the rocks if Tehran hardliners scupper dialogue. If an Israeli attack is to blame, the President may also have an early crisis with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to sort out. This goes beyond America's adversaries hazing a new President. Biden's management of the situation will help define his legacy. China is accelerating a years-long rise and is now willing to assert its growing military might in Asia and its superpower influence elsewhere in the world. Russia, with its territorial grabs and election interference, is stepping up efforts to divide and weaken the West. Seeking to prolong his two decades in power amid simmering domestic discontent, President Vladimir Putin has a political motive to act aggressively abroad to match his quest to restore the respect the Kremlin lost with the fall of the Soviet Union. The Biden administration has made clear it understands adversaries are feeling out the new White House. An extraordinary head-to-head clash between US and Chinese officials in Alaska last month sent a clear message from Washington to Beijing that Biden wouldn't be pushed around. Since then, US and Chinese aircraft carrier task forces have steamed through the South China Sea. In addition, China sent a record 25 warplanes into Taiwan's self-declared air defense zone -- in a clear message to Washington to avoid what it sees as interference in its affairs. Taiwan is seen as the most likely trigger of a conflict between the US and China and presidents are bound by law to offer the island the means of self-defense. After Washington sent the USS John McCain through the Taiwan Strait last week, Beijing said it should not ""play with fire."" The Biden administration has been more outspoken than its European allies on Russia's pressure on Ukraine that has prompted fears of a full scale invasion on Putin's orders, or a more subtle attempt to destabilize the pro-Western government in Kiev. A senior US defense official told CNN last week that the Pentagon was considering sending a pair of ships to the Black Sea in order to show support for Ukraine's territory integrity, in a move that would further hike tensions. Blinken's tough talk  Secretary of State Antony Blinken -- who traded diplomatic jabs with Chinese officials in Alaska -- is not flinching from warnings to Russia and China likely to further exacerbate tensions. ""It would be a serious mistake for anyone to try to change the existing status quo by force."" Blinken said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday referring to China's aggressive tactics toward Taiwan, which it considers a rebel province. In Europe on Tuesday for NATO meetings at which the US announced an increased military presence in Germany, Blinken met Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleb. He had set the stage by saying on NBC that if Russia continued to escalate ""the President's been clear, there'll be costs, there'll be consequences."" The tough talk may be designed to counter a belief that shines through foreign policy pronouncements in both Russia and China that the US is a power in inevitable decline and has been weakened by two decades of war, financial crises, internal political strife and a poor pandemic response. It also must be seen in the context of the former President's approach to foreign policy. Trump frequently fawned over Putin and often undermined what was a comparatively tough administration approach to Russia by often seeming to act in the interests of a power that meddled in two US elections to help him. The former President was also susceptible to flattery from China's aggressive, nationalist President Xi Jinping, who he portrayed as a dear friend -- at least until the eruption of the pandemic in Wuhan threatened his reelection hopes. But rhetoric only goes so far. Ultimately, China knows that it's unlikely a US president could justify a war with the Asian giant over Taiwan as a vital national interest -- especially one who is more interested in getting out of wars than starting new ones. And while the US has supplied Ukraine with offensive weapons, it's inconceivable that Biden would take the US to the brink of war with nuclear-armed Russia over Ukraine, which is not even a NATO ally. The White House position on both Russia and China is that it will seek cooperation with both states where possible but that adversarial relationships are more likely along with intense economic competition with China. For instance, CNN has reported that Biden's global climate envoy, former Secretary of State John Kerry, will shortly travel to Beijing to seek common ground ahead of a UN climate summit in Scotland in November. And in an intriguing move, Biden on Tuesday called Putin and offered him a summit in a third country in the coming months -- only weeks after agreeing in a television interview that the Russian leader was a ""killer."" Biden's offer ostensibly gives Putin what he wants -- a place on a pedestal alongside the President of the United States in an echo of fabled Cold War summits among the world's two great powers. The move looks a lot like a carrot to pressure the Russian leader to avoid any actions in Ukraine -- or towards imprisoned opposition leader Alexey Navalny -- that might cause Biden to withdraw an offer to meet. Warnings over Afghanistan  Biden's decision on Afghanistan seems like a foreign policy move driven by domestic considerations. Hawkish Republicans are accusing him of a dangerous retreat that could repeat Washington's 1980s neglect after it helped rebels oust Soviet troops from Afghanistan. The subsequent vacuum caused years of civil war and a failed state that fostered the fundamentalist Taliban militia and a terror haven in which al Qaeda plotted the attacks on New York and Washington. ""Precipitously withdrawing US forces from Afghanistan is a grave mistake. It is retreat in the face of an enemy that has not yet been vanquished and abdication of American leadership,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said. But the Kentucky Republican's comments are not universally shared within his party, proof that fatigue with foreign wars harnessed by both Barack Obama and Trump on the way to the White House remains a powerful political force. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz for example, an avowed opponent on everything that Biden does and a potential 2024 GOP presidential candidate, had no problems with Biden advertising a departure date for US soldiers. ""Bringing our troops home should not be taken as a sign that America will be any less vigilant in protecting American lives and those of our allies, but we can do so without a permanent military presence in a hostile terrain,"" he said. If Biden sticks to his plan, he will achieve what Obama and Trump both tried and failed to do -- ending US involvement in a generation of post-September 11 wars abroad.","{'neg': 0.262, 'neu': 0.738, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.4939}",57,196.0,0.324,0.676,0.0,-0.8625,0.144,0.776,0.079,-0.9987,-49.1625,137.5346142857143,592.0,0.2323219835907336
Mysterious blackout in Iran threatens to undermine nuclear talks,2021-04-12,"Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif has vowed revenge against Israel after an apparent attack on an Iranian nuclear site caused a blackout at the facility over the weekend.  The incident threatens to undermine recently revived diplomatic efforts between Washington and Tehran to revive the 2015 nuclear deal. Newly inaugurated centrifuges at Iran's Natanz facility, a centerpiece of the country's contentious nuclear program, appeared to have been badly damaged in Sunday's incident, which Tehran has described as an act of ""nuclear terrorism.""  Israel's army chief hinted at possible Israeli involvement in the attack in comments on Sunday. Several Israeli media outlets, quoting unnamed intelligence sources, said Mossad, the national intelligence agency, was behind the operation but offered no other details. The most high-profile condemnation from Tehran came on Monday, according to Iran's state-run IRNA news agency, when Zarif reportedly accused Israel of seeking ""revenge"" over Iran's efforts to lift US sanctions on the country during last week's indirect negotiations to return to the nuclear deal.   ""Our stance will be stronger, and our sides in the negotiations must know that our enriching installations were so far the first generation,"" Zarif said, according to IRNA. ""But from now on, we will fill Natanz with further advanced centrifuges with many more folds of power of enrichment."" Zarif also tweeted on Monday a letter addressed to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, which argued that ""the deliberate targeting of a highly sensitive safeguarded nuclear facility—with the high risk of potential release of radioactive material—constitutes reckless criminal nuclear terrorism."" It calls on the US to remove all sanctions imposed on Iran since the adoption of the JCPOA.  What actually happened?  The details of the incident at Natanz are murky. Iranian officials said Sunday that there was an act of ""sabotage"" that led to a blackout at the underground facility in the desert of Isfahan. They also said this happened hours after Iran ceremoniously launched advanced centrifuges at the Natanz plant on Sunday. The extent of the damage is unclear but Zarif's promise to replace the centrifuges indicates that material losses may have been extensive.   Iran denies there were casualties, but the spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Behrouz Kamalvandi, was badly injured at the facility, according to state media, falling from a height of seven meters on the same day. Officials have not linked Kamalvandi's reported injuries to the incident. But on Monday, a video was released on social media showing him on a hospital bed vowing ""to resist."" ""Our nuclear industry is a time-honored and resilient industry. Our battle will be continued. We will resist,"" said Kamalvandi in a video address. This is not the first security issue at Natanz. The facility lost a building when a fire broke out last July, in an incident officials described as an attack on its nuclear program. In 2010, the facility was also the target of the Stuxnet cyberattack, which security experts believe was carried out by Israel and the US. What was going on at the plant at the time? On Saturday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani announced new advanced uranium enrichment centrifuges at Natanz, maintaining Iran's official line that its nuclear activities were for ""peaceful and civil purposes"" but touting the country's nuclear ability as stronger than ever before. The inauguration of the centrifuges came on the 15th anniversary of the Iran's National Nuclear Technology Day. The unveiling was yet show of defiance by Tehran as it begins new talks over the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which lifted US sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on its uranium enrichment program. In 2018, then-US President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal, unleashing waves of crippling sanctions on Iran. A year later, Tehran began to gradually withdraw from its commitments to the nuclear deal, resuming parts of its uranium enrichment program. But US President Joe Biden has vowed to return to the JCPOA. For months, Tehran and Washington have been at loggerheads about who should return to the landmark deal first -- Iran says it won't curb enrichment before the US lifts all sanctions, and the US has accused Iran of intransigence. However, the last week showed signs of the stalemate thawing. Indirect talks between Washington and Tehran in Vienna, where other parties to the JCPOA shuttled between the two sides, appeared fruitful. Both sides have called the dialogue ""productive."" What is Israel saying? In keeping with usual practice, Israel has given no official comment on the Natanz incident. But on Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared to issue a veiled threat to Iran at a toast to mark the anniversary of the founding of the state of Israel. ""The struggle against Iran and its proxies and the Iranian armament efforts is a huge mission,"" he said, appearing alongside Israel Defense Forces chief Aviv Kohavi and his senior commanders, as well as Defense Minister Benny Gantz. ""The situation that exists today will not necessarily be the situation that exists tomorrow."" In comments interpreted as a hint at Israel's possible involvement in the Natanz incident, Kohavi said on Sunday the country's ""operations throughout the Middle East are not hidden from the eyes of the enemies."" In November, Iran's top nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, was assassinated in an attack that rattled the country. A senior US administration official said Israel was behind the killing. Israel's leadership has vocally opposed the US's return to the JCPOA, arguing that it emboldens Tehran and compromises Israel's security.   On Monday, Netanyahu meets with US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin who is on a visit to Israel. It is the highest-level visit to Israel by a member of the Biden administration. What does it mean for nuclear talks? The apparent attack could complicate the course of nuclear talks, but it is unclear to what extent, and officials have indicated that the talks will carry on. Zarif hinted that Israel was lashing out at the ""success"" of the talks according to the IRNA and Austin on Monday said that the dialogue will continue. Austin did not comment directly on the Natanz incident when asked about it by journalists Monday saying only, ""I'm aware of the report, I really don't have anything to add on Natanz,"" he said. ""In terms of our efforts to engage Iran in diplomacy and the JCPOA, those efforts will continue and I'm obviously supportive of the President's efforts to negotiate a way ahead there. And I'll just leave it at that.""  However, while the scale of the damage at Natanz is still not publicly known, the facility's apparently reduced capabilities could weaken Iran's hand in negotiations. Ramped up uranium enrichment and the potential enhancement of centrifuges served to increase pressure on the US to expedite and expand the scope of sanctions relief.

Israeli army chief appears to hint at possible role in Iran nuclear site incident,2021-04-11,"Israel's army chief has appeared to hint at possible Israeli involvement in an incident at the Natanz nuclear site in Iran, which was described as ""terrorist action"" by the head of Iran's atomic energy agency.  Iranian officials on Sunday confirmed an ""incident"" at Natanz, an underground facility where uranium enrichment takes place. ""Fortunately, the incident did not cause any human injuries or leaks,"" said Behrouz Kamalvand, a spokesman for Iran's Atomic Energy Organization (AEOI). ""The causes of the accident are under investigation and further information will be announced later.""  AEOI condemned the incident, calling it a ""terrorist action,"" according to the Iranian telegram channel of the Revolution Guard Corps, or IRGC, a branch of the Iranian Armed Forces.  ""The blackout in Natanz on the anniversary of National Nuclear Day is suspicious and may be due to sabotage while Iran is trying to convince the Western countries to lift the sanctions,"" said Malek Shariati Niaser, a member of Iran's parliament, the semi-official news website Entekhab.ir reported. Just hours after Iranian officials reported the incident, Israel's army chief Aviv Kochavi said the country's ""operations throughout the Middle East are not hidden from the eyes of the enemies."" ""They are watching us, seeing the capabilities and carefully considering their steps,"" he said, speaking Sunday at a remembrance event in Jerusalem to mark fallen soldiers. Reports in several Israeli media outlets Sunday quoted intelligence officials saying Israel's national intelligence agency, Mossad, was responsible for the incident. While few details of the unnamed officials are offered, some outlets described them as ""Western intelligence sources,"" though it is not immediately clear whether ""Western"" includes the possibility the sources are from Israel or not.  Israel's Prime Minister's office offered no comment on the reports, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed Iran Sunday at a toast to mark the anniversary of the founding of the state of Israel.  ""The struggle against Iran and its proxies and the Iranian armament efforts is a huge mission,"" he said, appearing alongside Israel Defense Forces chief Kochavi and his senior commanders, as well as Defense Minister Benny Gantz. ""The situation that exists today will not necessarily be the situation that will exist tomorrow.""  Netanyahu is due to meet Monday with US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin who is on a visit to the country. It is the highest-level visit to Israel by a member of the Biden administration and comes days after talks in Vienna aimed at restarting negotiations on a possible new nuclear deal between Iran and a US-led group of world powers.  US officials were also in Vienna and met with representatives from global powers who are still party to the deal. They did not meet with Iranian officials directly.  Former US President Donald Trump began imposing new sanctions on Iran as he withdrew the United States from the deal. Iranian officials have maintained the US must lift all Trump-era sanctions and return to the nuclear deal before it again complies with the agreement. Israel's leader repeated his strong opposition this week to the prospect of a restored Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)-type deal, saying Israel ""would not be bound by any agreement that paves the way for Iran to develop nuclear weapons."" Iran condemns 'terrorist action' Leaders in Iran condemned the incident. Akbar Salehi, chief of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, said: ""Iran reserves the right to respond against the perpetrators, and those who committed the terrorist action,"" IRGC reported. ""Today's attack demonstrates that the enemies of Iran's progress and advancement in nuclear science, as well as nuclear negotiations, are in desperation committing terrorist actions against the nuclear technology at Natanz [nuclear facility]."" In Iranian news agency reports, other Iranian officials suggested the facility may have come under attack, speculating the plant may have been targeted as the country discusses a revival of the Iran nuclear deal with its Western signatories.  A spokesman for the International Atomic Energy Agency told CNN by email on Sunday the agency was aware of the media reports. ""We have no comment at this stage,"" he said. During the 15th anniversary of Iran's National Nuclear Technology Day Saturday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani announced new uranium enrichment centrifuges at the plant, stating that while Iran's nuclear activities are for ""peaceful and civil purposes,"" the country's nuclear capability was also stronger than at any time before.  ""Today, a chain of 164 IR-6 centrifuges was launched,"" Rouhani said Saturday, according to state-run Press TV. ""It can provide us with products 10 times more than the former chain."" The Natanz nuclear plant lost a building when a fire broke out last July. The Iranian government said at the time that it was an attack on its nuclear program. It was also the target of the Stuxnet cyberattack in 2010, which security experts believe was carried out by Israel and the US.

"5 things to know for April 6: Covid-19, infrastructure, LGBT rights, Israel, Russia",2021-04-06,"April is now Arab American Heritage Month, the State Department has announced. It's a time to celebrate and recognize a group whose contributions are, in a State Department spokesman's words, ""as old as America itself."" Here's what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. (You can also get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Coronavirus   The highly contagious Covid-19 variant first discovered in the UK has now spread to all 50 states. More than 15,000 such cases have been reported in the US, and while vaccines are highly effective against the variants, medical experts are worried we may not be vaccinating fast enough to prevent more major outbreaks. Remember, this mutation is dangerous because it's more severe and easier to catch. Meanwhile, the US is under pressure for its failure to share unused vaccines with other countries, even as powers like Russia and China have pursued aggressive vaccine diplomacy with others. Secretary of State Tony Blinken said things are moving as fast as possible, and the US will not use the exchange as a way to gain political favors. 2. Infrastructure The Senate parliamentarian, the person who interprets the rules and procedures of the body, has ruled that Democrats may amend the budget resolution they used for their Covid-19 relief bill. This is a key ruling for Democrats, because it could give them a way to pass President Joe Biden's infrastructure legislation without Republican support in the same way they got that big Covid-19 plan through. The infrastructure plan is the next big White House priority, but it's gained quick pushback from Republicans who have argued it's too expensive and includes overly partisan programs. This bill also encompasses far more than bridge repairs and repaved highways -- for instance, it also includes $400 billion to revolutionize home health care for the elderly and disabled. 3. LGBT rights Amid a wave of recent anti-LGBTQ legislation, two state leaders have made major moves in the other direction. Arkansas' Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson vetoed an anti-transgender health care bill that would've prohibited physicians in the state from providing gender-affirming procedures for trans people under 18. Hutchinson said while he believed the bill was well-intended, it would be a ""vast overreach"" and is the product of ""the cultural war in America."" Meanwhile, Virginia has become the first state in the South and the 12th state overall to ban ""gay and trans panic"" as a defense for murder or manslaughter. The bill was introduced by the state's only transgender lawmaker. Perpetrators of violent crimes sometimes argue that the victim's gender identity or sexuality provoked them to kill in a crime of passion -- a line of thought that LGBTQ advocates say excuses unacceptable actions and demeans LGBTQ lives. 4. Israel The results of Israel's fourth election in a little more than two years reveal more of the same: Political gridlock, and no clear path to a majority government. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party won the most seats in the Knesset (Israel's parliament), but they have not been able to bring together enough representation from other parties to form a majority. Now, Netanyahu is back in the courtroom as his corruption trial resumes. The Prime Minister faces charges in three separate cases, the most serious of which have to do with him allegedly giving financial favors to political allies in exchange for favorable news coverage. Unless he's granted special permission, Netanyahu may need to attend the entire trial. 5. Russia Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a law paving the way for him to run for two more presidential terms, potentially extending his rule until 2036. The provisions of this new law were decided last year in a landmark referendum on Russia's constitution. In addition to renewed term limits, the referendum included votes on a range of other amendments, including a provision that defined marriage strictly as a ""union of a man and a woman."" Putin, who turns 69 this year, is currently serving his fourth presidential term, which is set to end in 2024. He was in power from 2000 to 2008, and resumed office in 2012.  BREAKFAST BROWSE The Baylor Bears have won their first men's NCAA basketball title  And it was a heartbreaker for the Gonzaga Bulldogs, who had their perfect season cruelly snapped when it mattered most.  Illinois gymnast shows off Covid-19 vaccination card after sticking the landing Get stuck, stick it.
