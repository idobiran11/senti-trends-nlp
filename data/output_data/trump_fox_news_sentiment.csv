""as presiding officer, i will do my duty to ensure that these concerns receive a fair and open hearing in the congress of the united states.""he added: ""objections will be heard, evidence will be presented, and the elected representatives of the american people will make their decision.""pence acknowledged that ""some believe that as vice president, i should be able to accept or reject electoral votes unilaterally.""""others believe that electoral votes should never be challenged in a joint session of congress,"" pence wrote.

""all he has to do, this is from the number 1, or certainly, one of the top constitutional lawyers in our country, he has the absolute right to do it.""we are supposed to protect our country and support our constitution,"" pence said.

""we’re not going to let that happen."" videothe president, in recent hours, has increasingly put pressure on pence to intervene during the joint session, tweeting early wednesday: ""do it mike, this is a time for extreme courage!""the president has insisted that ""states want to correct their votes, which they now know were based on irregularities and fraud,"" adding that the ""corrupt process never received legislative approval.""""all mike pence has to do is send them back to the states, and we win,"" trump tweeted.the president, hours before, tweeted that if pence ""comes through for us, we will win the presidency.""""many states want to decertify the mistake they made in certifying incorrect & even fraudulent numbers in a process not approved by their state legislatures (which it must be.)"" videothe president has said that he and pence ""are in total agreement that the vice president has the power to act,"" and has claimed that the election ""was illegal.""trump went on to say that pence has ""several options under the u.s. constitution.""""he can decertify the results or send them back to the states for change and certification,"" trump said. ""he can also decertify the illegal and corrupt results and send them to the house of representatives for the one vote for one state tabulation.""a spokesman for pence declined to comment on the president’s latest tweets, but white house officials told fox news on tuesdaythat pence will ""follow the law,"" saying that pence is ""taking a very diligent and studious approach to his job tomorrow.""""he has consulted at length with staff. he has gone through the electoral count act several times,"" an official said.""he has read legal opinions, met with the senate parliamentarian and consulted with outside experts on the subject matter.""but those officials add that ""the vice president will follow the law,"" and that he will act ""with fidelity to the law and the constitution.""the president’s remarks also come just hours after the georgia senate runoffs, where democrats are projected to pick up one—and possibly two—seats, which would hand them the majority in the u.s. senate.the president went on to saythat the democrats ""used the pandemic as a way of defrauding the people in a proper election."" brooke singman is a fox news digital politics reporter. you can reach her at brooke.singman@fox.com or @brookesingman on twitter.",10.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.13371173348277807,0.7111548125743866,0.15513345394283534,0.0752725875016952,0,0,0,0,0.752725875016952,,,

Jonathan Turley: It's legally absurd to claim Trump committed crime ...,2021-01-06 05:00:00,17.0," close video trump call with georgia secretary of state draws bipartisan criticism fox news chief white house correspondent john roberts joins 'special report' with the latest on leaked audiofor many legal analysts, president trump remains a type of criminal midas figure: everything he says or does turns instantly into a crime. this pattern is continuing to the very end of the trump administration. within minutes of the leaking of a saturday call between trump and georgia election officials, the same experts were declaring yet another clear crime.the loudest was andrew weissmann, whose desire to find a crime to use against trump appears to be moving from the obsessional to the delusional. since his departure as the top deputy to special counsel robert mueller, weissmann (now an msnbc analyst) seems intent on proving his critics correct about his profound bias against president trump.weissmannrecently called forprosecutors to use grand juries to pursue trump and others in an unrelenting campaign based on unfounded legal theories. now he is claiming that the president’s call with georgia secretary of state brad raffensperger is clear evidence of a criminal act.while i clearly come to these questions from the counter perspective of a criminal defense attorney, the claim is legally absurd.trump lawyer slams georgia secretary of state raffensperger for 'secretly' recording 'confidential' callwhen the tape was released, many of us immediately criticized the statement of the president that ""i just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state.""however, experts immediately declared this yet another clear criminal act and some people even called for a type of twilight impeachment in the last couple weeks of the trump administration. weissmann declared that the tape showed ""criminal intent"" as well as ""proof of his motive and his pattern of similar activity.""more from opinion tucker carlson: forget trump phone call, here's what really matters about georgia senate runoffsgutfeld on the media uproar over trump's georgia phone calldoug schoen: senate will give biden problems no matter who wins georgia runoff electionsthe problem is that weissmann again left the criminal code and controlling case law behind in his blind pursuit of trump. as with the obstruction allegations investigated by mueller and the ukrainian call that was the basis for trump’s impeachment by the house of representatives, this comes down to a question of intent.while most experts are notably vague on the specific criminal provision, one possibility would be election fraud under 52 u.s. 20511. however, such an interpretation comes to a full stop at intent — a required showing of ""knowingly and willfully"" acting to subvert voting.the call trump participated in was a settlement discussion over election challenges with a variety of lawyers present, not some backroom at the bada bing club. the entire stated purpose of the challenges was to count what the trump campaign alleged were uncounted votes that far surpassed the 11,780 deficit.trump repeatedly asserted that he won the election and continued to return to the fact that officials only needed to confirm 11,780 of those hundreds of thousands of allegedly uncounted ballots.nevertheless, experts likeanthony michael kreis, a professor at the georgia state university college of law,declared that trump’s ""only demand is to have votes tossed or invented to fabricate a win"" and that ""there’s no way to read this other than a blatant attempt to pressure georgia officials to lie and alter legitimate election results with a wink and a nod to a looming consequence.""but trump did not actually say that and it is not the only possible interpretation of what he did say. he was discussing what he viewed as uncounted votes that far exceeded the margin of roughly 12,000 and noting, as part of the request for access to data, that they do not need to find much to overturn the result.in any criminal case, trump would simply argue that he was restating the point of the pending cases in a settlement negotiation: that the election was not fair and that a review could easily flip the result given the margin.a prosecutor would have to show that trump clearly knew his theories were bogus and that he did not believe there were sufficient ballots to reach that number.even if prosecutors could find a basis for establishing intent, they would still be pushing fraud statutes beyond any intelligible limits without more direct evidence of intent. ironically, this is the very issue that marred weissmann’s career and the reason many of us viewed his selection by mueller to be an egregious error.weissmann was responsible for the overextension of an obstruction provision in a jury instruction that led a unanimous supreme court to reverse the conviction in the arthur andersen case in 2005.weissmann proceeded to make the same exaggerated claims with mueller (which were apparently rejected by the staff) and has continued to do so as a msnbc analyst.weissmann seems impervious to conflicting case law, including supreme court decisions rejecting such broad interpretations of fraud, bribery and extortion statutes in political corruption cases.inkelly v. united states, the supreme court threw out the convictionsin the ""bridgegate"" case and unanimously ruled that fraud laws are ""limited in scope"" and congress ""did notauthorize federal prosecutors to ""set standards of disclosure and good government for local and state officials.""weissmann’s fraud prosecution would be based on a statement that could be easily defended as part of a settlement discussion without any clear threat or benefit discussed. they were discussing what trump was seeking access to data and his belief that fraudulent, and possible criminal, conduct marred the results. one can reject those claims (as i have) without converting the matter into a faux criminal case.click here to sign up for our opinion newsletteryet, some are not satisfied with just a condemnation of trump. they want a prosecution. to that end, another former prosecutor, daniel goldman, stepped forward to offer his own assurances of a criminal case to be made against trump. (house intelligence committee chairmanadam schiff, d-calif.,previously hired goldman, who earlier called trump a ""shameful"" person who ""doesn’t care about the country"" and committed a variety of crimes).goldmanfocused on the line""it’s gonna be costly to you."" goldman said that ""i’ve charged extortion in mob cases with similar language.""in reality, trump said ""it’s going to be very costly in many ways"" which is very different than ""it will be costly to you.""the extortion theory is the same basic theory that was raised in the trump impeachment hearing. i testified at that hearing and noted that this type of interpretation has been previously rejected by the supreme court.click here to get the fox news appi would be interested to see the cases that goldman charged solely on this type of line. the statement in a settlement that further litigation is going to be ""costly"" is hardly unprecedented. moreover, trump stated after that line: ""i think you have to say that you’re going to reexamine it, and you can reexamine it, but reexamine it with people that want to find answers, not people that don’t want to find answers."" if goldman did bring cases on that type of evidence, it is chilling in its own right.of course, none of this matters. that is just law and this is legal entertainment. in our media echo chambers, such views are rarely challenged. viewers hear what they hoped to hear from experts who are eager to supply endless theories of criminality. but the same flexibility and creativity applied to the criminal code does not extend to figures like hunter or joe biden. trump just has that criminal midas touch.click here for more from jonathan turley jonathan turley is the shapiro professor of public interest law at george washington university and a practicing criminal defense attorney. he is a fox news contributor.",19.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.6803965203856167,0.2714862434046441,0.04811724291893801,-0.7297799132223913,0,0,0,0,-13.865818351225435,-34.69974611092227,62.0,-0.5596733243697141

Harvard students seek to revoke Trump graduates' diplomas after ...,2021-01-14 19:32:00,20.0," video they’re at it again. following last year’s efforts to ban trump administration officials from speaking on campus, harvard university students are now circulating a petition that calls for revoking degrees from trump supporters and aides who attended the elite ivy league institution, fox business has learned.the reason cited, according to a copy of the petition reviewed by fox business, is that supporters of president trump were involved in spreading the “disinformation and mistrust” that led to last week’s deadly riot at the united states capitol building. harvard letter to revoke select grads connected to trump harvard letter 2021 by fox business on scribdthe petition is entitled, “revoke their degrees,” and was circulated by four students who attend harvard'skennedy school of government, fox business has confirmed. it calls on the university to be “prepared to take a stand for representative democracy and against violent white supremacy,” by specifically revoking degrees of three harvard graduates who are supporters of the president: white house press secretary kayleigh mcenany, senator ted cruz (r-tx), and representative dan crenshaw (r-tx).all were described as “violent actors” who need to be held accountable for their alleged actions, the petition said. a spokesman for harvard declined to comment other than to say the university is aware of the petition. mcenany, cruz and crenshaw had no immediate comment.jason chaffetz: evidence of 'big conspiracy' behind capitol riotthe petition began circulating on wednesday and is said to be gaining some traction among both current and former students, fox business has learned.“i was surprised how popular this petition is even among mid-career students"" one student who says he won't sign on to the effort and spoke on the condition of anonymity because he's afraidof reprisals. “it’s one thing for 22-year-olds to sign onto something radical but another thing for 40-year-olds to buy into it.”the petition argues that a harvard degree is “a privilege, not a right” and therefore no one is entitled to keep their degree if they violatecertain laws and societal norms. some supporters of the effort have cited harvard’s decision in 2010 to revoke a degree from arussian spy, andrey bezrukov, as setting a precedent for revoking degrees from trump associates.click here to read more on fox businessbut legal scholars say any move to revoke a degree would face serious court challenges. they say the bezrukov example is a poor one because he attended the school using a pseudonym and pleaded guilty to spying on the us.meanwhile, none of the people named as targets in the petition are being investigated for inciting last week's unrest. the president, himself, is under investigation for possibly inciting the d.c. riot, but such cases are difficult to prosecute.“it would be illegal and highly immoral to revoke a degree based on constitutionally protected actions like former students merely supporting the president,” alan dershowitz the felix frankfurter professor of law, emeritus at harvard law, told fox business. “and the end result would be to jeopardize federal funding"" because the university would then become a de facto political institution, dershowitz, who wrote the 2018 book, ""the case against impeaching trump,""added.in november, fox business was first to report that students were circulating a petition to ban trump aides and supporters from campus speaking engagements or merely walking on campus. the effort dissolved quickly and was not taken up by the university's leadership.but the latest petition may have more teeth asit comes in the wake of last week’s violent pro-trump protests that led to five deaths, and widespread outrage over the president's refusal to concede the 2020 election to joe biden -- a move that was supported by many republicans.last week, for example, a harvard kennedy student named diego garcia blum, once again demanded that harvard dean larry bacow ban trump associates from the university. it was co-signed by 300 students, the harvard crimson student newspaper reported. earlier this week, a harvard kennedy school professor ryan enos wrote a similar letter to bacow, the crimson also reported.get fox business on the go by clicking hereon tuesday, harvard announced it was removing rep. elise stefanik (r-n.y.) from the harvard institute of politics senior advisory committee for voting against certifying the 2020 election. kennedy school dean douglas elmendorf said in a statement that stefanik ""has made public assertions about voter fraud in november’s presidential election that have no basis in evidence, and she has made public statements about court actions related to the election that are incorrect… moreover, these assertions and statements do not reflect policy disagreements but bear on the foundations of the electoral process through which this country’s leaders are chosen.”",5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.7063791021704674,0.2679611722007394,0.025659716222435236,-0.8404752164011011,0,0,0,0,-4.202376082005506,-31.087529416988836,67.0,-0.4639929763729677
Ari Fleischer: Trump is a political wrecking ball — but with ...,2021-01-15 06:00:00,21.0," close video fleischer: peaceful transfers of power were a hallmark of america until now fox news contributor ari fleischer on the fallout of violence in washington.president trump entered office in 2017 as a political wrecking ball. he leaves the presidency wednesday as an even bigger wrecking ball. in between, he was a wrecking ball with accomplishments.however, the problem with wrecking balls is that unless they are controlled by a skilled operator, they can swing backward and harm the person controlling them. that’s a good description of what trump has done throughout his presidency, from some of his tweets to some of his more inflammatory statements — and especially after he stirred the pot that helped inspire the jan. 6 riot at the u.s. capitol.the rioters marred the president’s accomplishments and did tremendous damage to a worthy cause, especially for over 74 million peaceful americans who voted for trump.dan scavino tells trump officials to be ‘proud’ of accomplishmentstrump marred his own accomplishments as well, but still, he should be judged for what he did throughout his presidency, the good and the bad. there is something to learn about america too, considering how many people supported him.trump won the second-most votes ever in a presidential election, after president-elect joe biden, who received about 7 million more.the president’s appeal is and was that he is an anti-washington outsider. a massive number of americans don’t trust politicians and hold washington in low regard. many yearn for someone authentic, who bluntly speaks his or her mind.add to the mix a congress that barely functions, problems that don’t get solved, and experts, including a biased media, that accepted the false trump-russia collusion charges made by democrats. it’s no wonder the public was open to an outsider who threatened to disrupt the government.trump had some remarkable accomplishments on his watch. videoprior to the arrival of covid-19, the u.s. poverty rate dropped to its lowest level since 1959, an amazing fact that barely received any attention because the news came out during the pandemic.in fact, in late 2018 trump did more to lift up the poor than any of his predecessors, including president lyndon johnson, who launched the war on poverty.the unemployment rate for those without a high school diploma, pre-pandemic, also hit the lowest level in recorded history. hispanic and african american unemployment hit record lows.wages, stagnant for a decade, shot up under trump, especially for working blue-collar americans. these people benefitted greatly by trump’s low-tax and deregulation policies.unfortunately, the economic dislocation caused by the coronavirus wiped out many of the benefits on the jobs front that trump had achieved.more from opinion michael goodwin: democrats want to bring down anyone who ever backed trumpdan gainor: cnn goes full-throttle after trump supporters, includes them in same group as nazis, klan membersjason chaffetz: democrats have leveraged pandemic, economic pain and civil unrest for political gainin addition, the president brought relative peace to the middle east. he virtually destroyed isis and helped achieve remarkable peace agreements that will lead to diplomatic relations between four muslim nations and israel — an extraordinary accomplishment.trump stood up to china, resetting the terms of relations between our countries. he understands that china is a growing threat to america — economically, morally and militarily. he opened people’s eyes to these problems and stood up to china using tariffs — a tool no typical politicians would have used.the president’s appointments to federal courts, especially the supreme court, will have an impact for decades.politically, trump was a mixed bag, although he fared better than president barack obama. obama and trump both came into office with the house and senate under their party’s control and each left having lost those institutions.however, democrats lost 13 seats in the senate under obama, while republicans lost just one under trump between 2017 and this year.under obama, democrats lost 69 seats in the house. under trump, the gop lost 29 house seats.obama left behind a wiped-out, unpopular democratic party. trump leaves an exhausted and split republican party that almost took the house in november, has a 50-50 tie in the senate and still has control of most governorships and statehouses. the gop in 2021 is in a much better position than it was in 2009.trump’s biggest problem was and is himself. he regularly went too far, crossed too many lines, and offended too many people. if he had toned himself down a notch or three, he could have kept many of the voters who liked his tough, blunt approach without losing as many women and college graduates, especially in the suburbs, who were turned off by his tweets and his demeaning behavior.it’s one thing to fight when necessary, but it’s another to fight everyone, including your allies, almost all the time, in ways that go too far, culminating in a takeover of the capitol by pro-trump forces. the march took place after trump summoned his supporters to come to washington jan. 6 and then instructed them at a rally to march to the capitol.""you’ll never take back our country with weakness,"" trump told the crowd. ""you have to show strength, and you have to be strong.""click here to sign up for our opinion newsletterremember the first presidential candidate debate, the one in which trump and biden interrupted each other all night long? then there was the second debate, where trump bit his tongue.if his four years were more like the second debate than the first, trump would likely be enjoying another four years as president.but that’s not who trump is. he is an alpha-male who often pushes conspiracy theories and stays focused on his own greatness. he lost an election and never accepted the truth about it. his personality dominates his accomplishments. he thinks that’s why he won; he doesn’t understand that’s why he lost.as for what happens next, the future for republicans might not look bright right now, but it is.the gop should be america’s blue-collar, populist, outsider party, dedicated to individual and religious freedom. it should be the party that stands up to china. and it should do all this without saying or doing crazy things that scare college-educated voters, especially women.click here to get the fox news appthe republican party must resist violence in all forms, denounce white supremacy and continue to grow in black and hispanic communities.donald trump is the very definition of unique. no other candidate will be like him.a steady outsider will emerge who is trump-like in policy, without being donald trump. that candidate can take back the white house and show republicans how to take back congress.click here for more from ari fleischer ari fleischer serves as a contributor for both fox news channel (fnc) and fox business network (fbn.) he is currently the president of ari fleischer communications and ari fleischer sports communications. he is based out of new york and joined the network in july 2017. he is the author of the new book ""suppression, deception, snobbery, and bias: why the press gets so much wrong―and just doesn't care (broadside books, july 12, 2022).""",21.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.4875114561014232,0.1657585452443787,0.3467299931106113,-0.11536318761184065,0,0,0,0,-2.4226269398486537,-15.226275824078437,62.0,-0.245585093936749

(ap photo/alex brandon) trump had promised that his administration would build 450 miles of wall by the end of 2020 and last week officials announced that that had been achieved. additionally, there are more than 300 miles under construction or pre-construction. it’s a remarkable shift in construction from last year -- where only 100 miles had been built by jan. 2020.if biden halts border wall, it could cost taxpayers billions, cbp chief warnscritics have noted that much of the construction replaces a structure that was always there.but officials have said that there is no comparison between the old landing mat-style structure that could easily be climbed or pushed over, and the new 30-foot steel bollards that are madewith anti-climb technology, cameras, lighting and roads.the wall provided a key 2016 campaign promise for trump and a symbol for his efforts to get tough on illegal immigration. the wall is just one of a number of policies to secure the border. others include the migrant protection protocols, which keeps migrants in mexico as they await their hearings, and asylum cooperative agreements with northern triangle countries to stem the flow of migrants to the border. videothe combined efforts helped end the 2019 border crisis during which more than 100,000 migrants a month flooded toward the border in the spring. this year, the administration was given a tool in the form ofa centers for disease control order related to the covid-19 pandemic, which allows migrants to be quickly returned to home countries within hours of being apprehended.on tuesday, trump declared that his administration has ""achieved the most secure southern border in u.s. history.""""we took on the cartels, the coyotes and the special interests and we restored the rule of law,"" he said.as trump's border wall tops 450-mile goal, cbp chief says more wall is comingthe trip to the wall gives trump an opportunity to shift attention to something other than the riots that engulfed the capitol last wednesday. trump has taken heat from republicans and democrats for what they say was his instigation of the violence.democrats have called for trump’s impeachment and are moving forward with the process, and a number of cabinet and administration officials have resigned over trump’s conduct.trump acknowledged he bears some blame for capitol riot in conversation with mccarthy: sourceson tuesday, trump described the group that stormed the capitolas a ""mob"" and said they ""trashed the halls of government.""""we believe in the rule of law not in violence or rioting,"" he said.he also brushed off calls for trump’s cabinet to remove him via the 25th amendment, saying it would hurt president-elect joe biden more than him.""the 25th amendment is of zero risk to me, but it will come back to haunt joe biden,"" he said.

pigeon fraudgop sours on trump, but many cling to election hoaxpresident trump’s post-election conduct, especially as it relates to the sacking of the capitol, is driving down his support among republicans.anew surveyfrom the pew research center found that republican disapproval of trump’s conduct has reached 20 percent, double what it was in the immediate wake of the election.more than half – 52 percent – of republicans said that trump bears at least some of the responsibility for the capitol attack. one in five republicans said trump should be removed from office before the end of his term.just a quarter of republicans still back trump across the board, saying that he has behaved well since the election, bears no responsibility for the attack, actually won a second term and should continue to be ""a major political figure for many years to come.""those numbers, coupled with an overall job approval rating of 29 percent, seems like a snapshot of a party engaged in a messy but inevitable breakup with a partner in a turbulent relationship. trump’s approval among republicans is down to 60 percent from a high of 85 percent last year.with president-electjoe bidenenjoying the beginnings of a real honeymoon – 64 percent of voters have a positive view of how biden is conducting himself – it’s possible to see how in just a matter of months trump, who has consumed the national consciousness at such length like no political figure since perhapsrichard nixon, could fade from view.but even as republicans begin the process of moving on, one number stands out among republican attitudes about this presidency: 64 percent of republicans said that trump either definitely or probably was the actual winner of the 2020 election. seventy percent of trump voters said that fraud was a major reason for the election result.as the georgia senate runoffs demonstrated, these opinions may be of serious long-term consequences of republican ambitions. if you had convinced your core supporters that elections are rigged it tends to make turnout efforts far more complicated.georgia’s government, which has a well-run, secure elections system, was not able to convince a significant number of trump’s core supporters that elections in the peach state are free and fair. if the extraordinary efforts these officials took to prove the validity of their system was not enough, what would convince such skeptics?the consequences of trump’s sustained effort to convince people, even before the election took place, that he would be cheated may have other lasting consequences for republicans and the nation.while election fraud is certainly real, as examples from both parties in recent electoral history prove, it is no good when a majority of one of the major parties is inclined not to respect the results of elections that are overwhelmingly properly conducted in most of the country.we are managing the peaceful transfer of power by the skin of our teeth this time, but if 64 percent of republicans have been duped into believing that trump actually won in what he calls a ""landslide"" it is sadly possible to imagine the day that this long, invaluable continuum may come to an end.certainly the more republicans bleat about stolen elections to cater to a political base that holds such an outlandish belief the more likely it will be that democrats who assail our elections system on the grounds of disenfranchisement through voter identification etc. will escalate their efforts to hit the kill switch on the american system.the false belief in a stolen election has another consequence for republicans: if you pretend trump did not really lose, you will not be able to learn the correct lessons from his loss.in the months and years to come, there will be a brutal fight within the gop on how to proceed. while trump certainly opened many political doors for republicans with working-class voters and his populist appeals definitely increased intensity, a worthwhile assessment of his political acumen and approach cannot take place if nearly two thirds of republicans are still snowed under trump’s election deception.it is certainly important for congress as a whole and republicans in both chambers to sort out how to respond to the events of jan. 6, but it would seem the crucial work of the party for its long term health would relate to disenchanting its voters from the magical thinking that the loser really won.many of those voters may not like it, but a lie that damaging will do far more harm if left to fester.the rulebook: what it is""what, then, are the distinctive characters of the republican form? were an answer to this question to be sought, not by recurring to principles, but in the application of the term by political

[emphasis added.]regardless, historians will dwell on the ensuing mayhem.pity.ari fleischer: trump is a political wrecking ball — but with remarkable accomplishmentsone hundred years from now, a fair-minded assessment of trump’s presidency will recognize his abundant domestic and international accomplishments. liberals unborn may be appalled. conservatives unconceived may applaud. but both should agree that trump was a consequential president whose sleeplessness achieved significant things, often while astonishing foes and friends alike.—the $1.5 trillion tax cuts and jobs act, a globally competitive 21% corporate tax rate, immediate deduction of business expenses, eight regulations junked for every new one inflicted, and washington’s overall pro-business tone helped generate the most robust economy in u.s. history.—total employment (peaking at 158,803,000 working americans in december 2019) never was higher. black and hispanic unemployment sank to their lowest levels ever, with female unemployment the lowest since president dwight eisenhower. median household income in 2019 hit a record $68,703 — up 6.8% from 2018. wages grew a healthy 3.6% that year, even as the left’s favorite adult toy, income inequality, slid for the second consecutive year under trump, after rising under president barack obama.—america’s poverty rate fell to 10.5% in 2019, a record low, with black poverty at 18.8%, its first year ever below 20 %.—stock markets soared, thanks to trumponomics. since january 20, 2017, the dow jones industrial average climbed from 19,732 to 30,814 friday

court justices, 54 appellate judges, and 174 trial-court appointees. the 2nd (new york city), 3rd (philadelphia), and 11th (atlanta) circuit courts of appeals all had democratic-nominated majorities

educational savings accounts to cover k-12 students, reauthorized the dc voucher program with $85 million in funds, stabilized assistance to historically black colleges and universities, conditioned federal assistance to colleges on their defense of campus free speech, and (by shredding obama’s title ix guidance letter) restored due process for college students (mainly men) often falsely accused of sexual misconduct.—trump vastly improved department of veterans affairs hospitals, launched veterans medical choice, strengthened health savings accounts, required medical price transparency, and secured for terminally ill patients the right to try experimental drugs.—trump was the first president to address the national march for life in person, rather than literally phoning in his remarks. he blocked title x funds to planned parenthood and halted subsidies for abortions overseas.—the president fought for a southern borderwall, to stop entry by illegal immigrants, gang members, drug smugglers, terrorists and others who break into america without permission. overcoming relentless democratic objections, trump ultimately prevailed.in fact, the president tuesday celebrated 452 miles of steel and concrete wall along the southern frontier. this distance roughly separates manhattan from greensboro, n.c., and connects san diego and san francisco. consequently, federal apprehensions and encounters on the u.s.-mexico border have plunged from977,509 in fiscal year 2019 to 458,088 in fiscal year 2020 — down 53.1%. —trump dumped the cost-rich, benefit-poor paris climate accord.—unlike the last three presidents, trump finally obeyed the 1995 jerusalem embassy act and moved america’s diplomatic mission to israel’s capital.—trump scrapped obama-biden administration’s absurd, ayatollah-friendly iran-nuclear deal.—trump flushed obama-biden’s asphyxiating rules of engagement and sicced u.s. and friendly forces on isis in early 2017. by year’s end, the bloodthirsty, primitive, islamic-extremist caliphate — which obama-biden let swell to the size of two new jerseys — was blasted clean off the map.—isis founder abu bakr al-baghdadi and iranian terror master qasem

emirates, bahrain, sudan, and morocco.—the president confronted china. he applied trade sanctions for its cheating and intellectual property theft, locked up its spy-choked houston consulate, slapped travel bans on top officials, and more.—while trump’s diplomacy with north korean leader kim jong un did not denuclearize that country, the north halted the underground nuclear bomb tests and long-range missile flights that chilled the obama-biden years.—the president harangued america’s nato allies to keep their word and spend at least 2% of gdp on common defense. while four nations complied in 2016, today 10 pay their fair share. through 2024, an extra $400 billion will fund nato, not at the expense of u.s. taxpayers. this also aggravates trump’s supposed ""employer,"" putin.in short, like fedex on steroids, president trump delivered on the right’s economic, cultural, and national security agendas.the covid-19 pandemicof course, the chinese virus arrived a year ago and ruined everything. the pandemic, ensuing lockdowns, and economic devastation lobbed a sledgehammer into trump’s prosperity machine. still, the economy recovered with unexpected briskness, although winter infections, clampdowns, and deaths are slowing things anew.even as trump ordered hospital ships to new york city and los angeles and erected pop-up hospitals across america, he pressed government and industry to produce ventilators, masks, gowns, and other medical gear.incredibly, operation warp speed yielded two covid-19 vaccines within nine months of the march 13

(criminal complaint.)will impeachment witnesses be called in trump trial? how the decision could impact the proceedingsthe impeachment managers have tried to preempt some of trump's anticipated defenses early in the trial while also maintaining a solemn tone, playing gruesome video of rioters attacking capitol police, seeking out lawmakers and their staffs and calling for the death of former vice president mike pence, among others. they've particularly leaned on security footage from the capitol showing the number of close calls lawmakers had where they could have been swept up and potentially injured or killed by the mob.""obviously very troubling to see the great violence that our capitol police and others are subjected to,"" sen mitt romney, r-utah, said when asked about video showing officer eugene goodman, lauded as a hero for his actions in the riot, guiding the senator to safety. ""it tears you at your heart and brings tears to your eyes, that was overwhelmingly distressing and emotional.""but the solemn tone was broken wednesday during a spat between lee, r-utah, and the impeachment managers -- and it could escalate thursday if the impeachment managers try to ""relitigate"" the point as schumer, d-n.y., said may happen.who are the democratic trump impeachment managers?as lead impeachment manager rep. jamie raskin, d-md., was preparing to close down the house's arguments for the day, lee requested to be recognized and said that the impeachment managers had incorrectly described what happened when trump called his phone on jan. 6. he asked that the statement, made by rep. david cicilline, d-r.i., be removed from the record of the trial. sen. mike lee, r-utah, wednesday got into a spat with house impeachment managers over a phone call former president trump made to his phone on jan. 6. live updates: trump impeachment trial continues as swalwell shares capitol footage""statements were attributed to me moments ago by the house impeachment managers... relating to the content of conversations between ... president trump and senator tuberville. they were not made by me. they're not accurate and they're contrary to fact,"" lee said.""i move... that they be stricken from the record,"" lee continued.senate president pro tempore patrick leahy, d-vt., who is presiding over the impeachment trial, said that lee's motion was not provided in the rules. lee then appealed the ruling and requested a roll call vote.but leahy's statement on what the rule was was not clear and prompted minutes of conversations about what exactly the senate was about to vote on. schumer put the senate into a quorum call ""while we work this out.""it appears that what lee was objecting to was related to acall that was reportedly made by trump to lee's phone during the capitol riot. the call was actually meant for sen. tommy tuberville, r-ala., and lee handed his phone to the tuberville so he could speak with trump.these attorneys are defending trump in the impeachment trialcicilline claimed that lee said the content of the call was trump asking tuberville to further delay the certification of the election results. but lee claimed that he had never said such a thing. in this july 14, 2020, file photo, republican u.s. senate candidate and former auburn football coach tommy tuberville speaks at a campaign event in montgomery, ala.

section 3) instructs that ""the senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments."" the house, which has sole power to move for impeachment, has done so, charging the former president with

from opinion dr. robert jeffress: impeachment -- why america must let go of bitterness to healjason miller: trump impeachment trial is unconstitutional – here's why senate must dismiss itgregg jarrett: democrats' impeachment of trump – here's why this is a lost causein fact, until a couple of weeks ago, we did notevenknow who would preside over this trial.there was speculation about whetherit would bechief justice john roberts,who last year sat on the senate’s first trumpimpeachment trial.but there will be no sequel for him. the constitution onlycalls for a judicial officer – the highest ranking one in the land – for impeachment of anincumbentpresident.trump is out of office...so we have a trial without a real judge.not only does thatraiseprofound questions about the integrity of the proceedings. it also provokesa serious constitutional issue about whether the senate trial is permissible– in fact, 45 republican senators contend that it is not.the main point of impeachment is toremovean official, and trump is already aformerpresidentwho obviously cannot be removed.democrats and some republicans point out that the constitution also makes disqualification from holding office in the future a penalty for impeachment, and thus the insist the trial is valid. but if thatpenaltywere intended to apply toformerpresidents, the trump legal teamcounters, the framerswouldhave mandated that a real, impartialjudge preside over the senate trial.in any event, the ""presiding officer"" will now be sen. patrick leahy, d-vt., one of the chamber’s most notoriously partisan democrats. if you have a vague memory from civics classes that the vice president of the united states is supposed to preside over senate proceedings, you’re recalling correctly. but in this instance, vice president kamala harris opted out because the biden administration is worried that the senate trial of a president from the opposition party – a trial that, with trump already out of office, is overwhelmingly opposed by republicans across the country – already has the appearance of a vindictive, partisan kangaroo court.you’re thinking that because the proceeding is a ""trial,"" thenfairness must be an absolute requirement.butit is not. having leahy fill the void in his capacity as the senate’s president pro tempore is not exactly reassuring from the standpoint of fairness.ah, but there’s the rub.you’re thinking that because the proceeding is a ""trial,"" thenfairness must be an absolute requirement.butit is not. impeachment is not meant to be fair. it is meant to be political.that’s not a bug, it’s a feature. trump’s liberty and property are not at stake – which is when due process requires a judicial trial with all the due process trimmings. impeachmentis apoliticalpower the constitution gives to congress, apoliticalbranch, in order to strippoliticalauthority, by removing it ordenying it in the future.publicoffice is not an individualright; it is apoliticaltrust. depriving a person of eligibility for that trustis a political determination.in our system,it is not somethingthatcalls forpolitical judgment, notjudicial due process. videolet’s descend from the abstractions of high principle to concrete political reality. in a senatetrial, there isnever animpartial jury.even when the chief justice presides over suchtrials,his role is merely ministerial. thesenate retainsthe power to overrule any decision the chief justicemakes.judicial rules and precedent do not control.the presence of a high-ranking judgewould simplycamouflage the brute fact that the proceeding is political, not legal.trump was impeached because democrats control the house.he will be acquitted because there are not enough republican votes to convict him.it’s got nothing to do with any legal analysis.on impeachment, the framers did not put their trust in law. they relied on politics.they considered assigning impeachment trials to a judicial court; but they opted instead for the senate – i.e., for the judgment of seasoned statesmen (they were all men back then), who would not ignore legal principles but who would never forget that they were accountable to voters and that, because impeachment is anti-democratic in the sense that it deprives voters of their choice for president, it must be reserved for true emergencies driven by heinous misconduct.even if trump’s misconduct was egregious, is this truly an emergency?the former president’s prospects of returning to power are highly doubtful.democrats are determined to conduct the trialnow, but thesenate could holditin abeyance until such time, if ever, that trump mounts a campaign to return to office.that possibility might do more to discourage a 2024trumpcampaign than an immediatetrialthatwillend in a certain acquittal. videonevertheless, the trial will proceed.because it’s a political process, it is easier to predict the outcome than the process. maybe there will be a full-blown trial in the well of the senate.under the chamber’s impeachment procedures, however, leahy could assign the matter to a committee – perhaps a body formed ad hoc, or perhaps a standing committee, most likely judiciary – which could effectively conduct a trial,in which witnesses are called and evidence is presented, but without effectively shutting down the senate’s work.click here to get the fox news appif that happened, the committee would certify the record of its proceedings and disseminate it to the full senate. at that point, the senate could decidetosupplement the record with additional testimony, or it couldjustdeliberate on a verdict.all of this will unfold starting tuesday. what it will look like, we can’t be sure. we know only that, though it will be called a ""trial,"" what we’ll be watching
