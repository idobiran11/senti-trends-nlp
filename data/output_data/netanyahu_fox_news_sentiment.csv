""they will never plan another terror attack again.""the decapitation strikes illustrate prime minister benjamin netanyahu’s plan to inflict massive and lasting damage on hamas. to head off any push for quick restraint, which would give hamas a public relations victory and spare its leaders, israeli officials told the biden adminis­tration to buzz off.they want the freedom to act because they believe it is crucial that hamas not only lose the war it started, but for its defeat to be widely seen and understood. otherwise, the terrorists will gain stature and an incentive to do it again.to achieve that success, israel needs sufficient time to smash the organization’s operating ability and destroy its arms cache. how much time is a guess, but it is probably a matter of days, not weeks.israel’s superiority drives the left crazy, with the anti-semitic wing of the democratic party calling the response inhumane and even terrorism. naturally, israel’s superiority drives the left crazy, with the anti-semitic wing of the democratic party calling the response inhumane and even terrorism. rep. ­ilhan omar ridiculously claimed the war is unfair because palestinians don’t have an iron dome.she should have reminded ­hamas of that before it started the rocket barrage.then again, the warning would have fallen on deaf ears because hamas paints a target on its own civilians by hiding explosives in residential neighborhoods and putting rocket launchers near schools. if it spent half as much on schools, medicine and civilian infrastructure as it spends trying to kill jews, gaza would be far better off.the vast tunnel system hamas built under gaza city is a glaring example of how it diverts millions of dollars and construction material to war while using ordinary palestinians as shields. videoisrael goes the extra mile by often warning arab civilians by telephone to evacuate buildings it is targeting, showing more concern for them than hamas does.does israel make mistakes, and sometimes hit innocent civilians? of course. but these are accidents, while hamas targets israeli civilians. where’s the outrage over that?the latest media huffing and puffing involves a charge that the israeli military spread a false claim that a gaza invasion was underway, with the aim of luring ­hamas fighters to tunnels, which israel promptly bombed.if true, the deception wasn’t ­kosher, but the outrage carries a whiff of hypocrisy. it’s as if the media demands a monopoly on fake news from israel.in fact, the war started as a propaganda bid by hamas. demonstrations over a jerusalem property dispute led to violence near al-aqsa mosque on temple mount, with arabs throwing rocks and israeli soldiers firing stun guns.the confrontation came days after the feckless palestinian president mahmoud abbas canceled elections in the west bank because hamas would have made gains and become part of the government. the rocket barrage is hamas’ way of showing palestinians it is their defender, and that abbas can’t be trusted. videooddly, hamas is right on the trust issue. now in the 16th year of a four-year term, abbas foolishly rejected every overture from the trump administration and ended up further isolated. his refusal to get to yes on any deal has impoverished his people and exasperated arab and muslim states.the decision by bahrain, the united arab emirates, morocco and sudan to recognize israel and establish trade and tourism relations in part reflected their disgust with abbas’ dithering.it’s also a given that hamas and iran are testing president biden. david friedman, who was trump’s ambassador to israel, argues hamas aimed to inflict damage on israel while being spared a full retaliation because it believed biden would quickly pressure israel to de-escalate.""i’m sure to hamas’ dismay the biden administration has not – at least not yet – sought to handcuff israel and has supported its right of self-defense,"" friedman writes in the the hill.click here to get the fox news appmore critically, friedman cites biden’s ""seemingly irrational eagerness"" to rejoin the iran nuclear deal. the new president wants to lift the trump-era economic sanctions without demanding any restraint on either iran’s nuclear program or aggressive support of hamas.count that as another reason why israel deserves the time to deal hamas a crushing blow. anything less will embolden the terrorists and iran to start yet another round of bloodletting.click here to read more from michael goodwin michael goodwin is a fox news contributor and new york post columnist.",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.6418361663818359,0.07310151681303978,0.03506228607147932,-0.7499999999999942,0,0,0,0,-0.7499999999999942,-1.898001496874199,8.0,-0.23725018710927487

discusses growing conflict in the democrat party surrounding israel-hamas conflictthis is a rush transcript from ""special report with bret baier,"" may 19, 2021. this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.good evening. welcome to washington. i'm bret baier.breaking tonight, we're following two major foreign policy stories. president biden is stepping up the pressure on israel to make what is being called a significant de-escalation in its conflict with hamas. but israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu is rejecting that call.first up, the president's decision to waive sanctions on the company behind a controversial russian pipeline project to europe, specifically germany. he's getting more criticism about that today even as the administration announces penalties for other russian entities.let's get details now from white house correspondent peter doocy, he's live on the north lawn. good evening, peter.peter doocy, fox news channel correspondent (on camera): good evening, bret. the day before the inauguration, antony blinken went to the senate and told lawmakers there he agreed with them that nord stream 2 pipeline was a bad idea but not for the environmental reasons that have led this administration to cancel pipelines here in the states already. instead, because it would give russia an advantage in the region.but tonight, the biden administration is going to waive sanctions on certain officials that will make it possible for this project to be completed. and antony blinken is sitting with russia's foreign minister right now in iceland making nice.(begin video clip)antony blinken, u.s. secretary of state: president biden has demonstrated that in both word and deed, not for purposes of escalation, not to seek conflict but to defend our interests.doocy (voice over): this foreign policy decision tonight has the top foreign policy democrat in the senate furious.bob menendez writes, the administration has said that the pipeline is a bad idea and that it is a russian malign influence project. i share that sentiment but fail to see how today's decision will advance u.s. efforts to counter russian aggression in europe.(end video clip)doocy (on camera): and as president biden makes this big concession to russia, who he is called an opponent before. he's also applying new pressure to israel, a long-standing u.s. ally.(begin video clip)doocy (voice over): it's long been part of biden's pitch on the campaign trail.joe biden, president of the united states: bibi netanyahu, i know well.doocy: and at the white house.jen psaki, white house press secretary: he's obviously somebody that he has a long-standing relationship with.doocy: today, a test as the white house tells us, the president conveyed to the prime minister that he expected a significant de-escalation today on the path to a ceasefire.sen. tom cotton (r-ar): who cares what joe biden expects? the people of israel have a right an expectation that they can protect themselves from thousands of rockets and missiles being fired into their cities.doocy: the white house provided a short readout of the leaders call but hasn't detailed what's next.unidentified female: what recourse does the u.s. have to take if israel doesn't meet that deadline?karine jean-pierre, white house deputy press secretary to jen psaki: well, again, i'm going to let the readout play out for -- say -- speak for itself.doocy: after a chat with democratic congresswoman rashida tlaib, a critic of israel who recently accused the israeli government of using an apartheid system against the palestine. the president sympathized with her relatives in the west bank.biden: i pray that your grand mom and family are well.doocy: did that get tlaib to lay off israel? no, because today she signed on to a resolution hoping to block biden from sending arms to israel saying the harsh truth is that these weapons are being sold by the united states to israel with the clear understanding that the vast majority of them will be used to bomb gaza.sen. ted cruz (r-tx): accusing israel of committing acts of terrorism as the squad has done, it is unconscionable.doocy: hoping to keep weapons away from israel's enemies, republican congressman brian mast re-introduced a resolution to sanction backers of the terror group hamas.rep. brian mast (r-fl): hamas does not finance terrorism with bake sales. they receive significant support from individual groups and foreign governments like iran.doocy: democrats defeated that resolution in a party line vote.unidentified male: in the opinion of the chairs the ayes have it.doocy: the president's day started with the mess in the middle east. but hours later, he tried to keep things light when coast guard academy graduates didn't appreciate a scripted joke.biden: you're a really dull class. i mean, come on man, is the sun getting to you?(end video clip)doocy (on camera): so, maybe president biden is not much of a comedian today, but he is showing himself to be a deliberator. there are no serious calls for him to send u.s. troops to the middle east to intervene in this new conflict. but there is pressure on him from progressives to stop helping israel.we do not expect any major foreign policy announcements for the rest of tonight though, because as soon as the president got back from delivering that commencement address, the white house told us no more on-camera events today, bret.baier: it's so-called lid. peter doocy live in the north lawn. peter, thanks.now, to the latest on the middle east fighting. senior foreign affairs correspondent greg palkot live in tel aviv early thursday morning. hello, greg.greg palkot, fox news channel senior foreign affairs correspondent (on camera): hello, bret. yes, there are new reports tonight that we could see a ceasefire between israel and hamas in the next couple of days.but as it stands right now, despite new white house pressure, we could be in a dangerous status quo.(begin video clip)palkot (voice over): amid ongoing clashes between israel and hamas, more signs a cessation in hostilities might be closer.president biden in another call with prime minister netanyahu saying he expects de-escalation today, more pressure to coming from the u.n., the e.u. and regional powers.netanyahu, however, remained in a fighting mood talking about hamas.benjamin netanyahu, israeli prime minister: there are only two ways that you can deal with them. you can either conquer them, and that's always an open possibility or you can deter them. and we are engaged right now in forceful deterrence.palkot: hamas striking out again southern in central israel in the rocket fire. israel even hit by rockets from lebanon, no one was hurt. the israelis remain active on the front lawn.we are at an airbase in central israel watching an f-15 of the israeli air force take off planes from here have been heading south to gaza, some 30 miles with some heavy weapons doing some pretty bad damage to militants there and others.the damage to hamas has been substantial. according to israel, some 820 terror targets hit, 130 militants killed, but it's the havoc heaped on palestinian civilians that has the world concerned. some 230 killed including 64 children, over 1,600 wounded, shortages in food, medicine, power and water. 60,000 homeless and some still missing.reham owda, political analyst: now we are in urgent need to save the civilian and protect the civilian. we need international community to support the civilian regardless of the conflict between israel and hamas.palkot: even this israeli air force captain who's been involved in multiple sorties over gaza sounds like he'd be happy for a break to.captain b, israeli air force pilot: on a personal level, i 100 percent want peace and want zero civilian casualties on both sides.(end video clip)palkot (on camera): and by the way, we were asked withhold that captain b's name for security reasons.throughout the night, we've been watching new reports of both hamas rocket fire and israeli airstrikes. it could be as some analysts have said to us last licks before the end, before that dangerous end. back to you, bret.baier: i hopefully so. greg palkot in tel aviv. greg, thanks.a presidential nominee for a key intelligence post. the top spot, he's under scrutiny tonight. a republican senator raising concern over work the nominee did for a chinese telecommunications company, huawei. a company that was called a national security threat by the last administration.correspondent kevin corke is here tonight with details. good evening, kevin.kevin corke, fox news channel correspondent (on camera): good evening, bret. huawei as you know has been heavily sanctioned by the u.s. government after accusations that its infrastructure equipment actually enables the chinese communist party to surveil users.and now, republicans on capitol hill are asking a key biden nominee searing questions about his past involvement with the company. his name is christopher fonzone. he's been nominated to become the general counsel of the odni, for the folks outside of washington at the office of the director of national intelligence.on tuesday, nebraska republican senator ben sasse asked fonzone about huawei's link to china's oppression of its uighur minority.(begin video clip)sen. ben sasse (r-ne): what do you think of the role that they've played in the chinese communist party's genocide in xinjiang?i'm trying to ask why would you make a decision to work for huawei, given who they are.christopher fonzone, odni, general counsel nominee: my firm asked if i would help address some questions on how does u.s. administrative law works. i did a very small amount of analysis on with respect to that question less than 10 hours.corke: less than 10 hours. so, the nominee also said that he's aware that the odni has made an assessment that huawei poses a significant counterintelligence risk. he also vowed that he would use the latest intelligence available in any legal analysis, but that answer didn't satisfy sasse.sasse: who did you

policy.pergram: that's right. there's a mask rebellion in the house here, bret. mccarthy wrote a resolution saying the house mask policy on the floor is contrary to cdc guidance. he says it's ""not based on the best available science."" some gop members say the house rule is arbitrary.(begin video clip)mast: there's not really a real protocol to it. they're just telling us that if we're on the floor without a mask, they're going to find us even though the cdc says if you've been vaccinated, resume your normal life.pergram (voice over): the house right now is voting to kill mccarthy's resolution. capital attending physician brian monahan rejected mccarthy's argument.monahan says the house's mask requirement is consistent with cdc policy. monahan says the house floor is the only

commission could actually lay on top of existing efforts by law enforcement and congress. the facts have come out and they'll continue to come out.pergram (voice over): some republicans who back the probe take issue with mcconnell's reasoning.to doj/fbi side is a criminal investigation. the house has oversight responsibility, namely to security breaches. security is very important, just like 9/11 where were the breakdowns in the system and the planning and the staffing and the preparation and figure out how we can fix that to make sure it never happens again.pergram: if the commission is formed, it's possible it could subpoena mccarthy and even former president trump.mccarthy says the commission's mandate was too narrow and it should have included the 2017 baseball practice shooting along with the good friday attack which killed officer billy evans.(end video clip)pergram (on camera): senate democratic whip dick durbin said he couldn't believe mcconnell's opposition. durbin says

american prisoners as leverage in its effort to get rid of crippling economic sanctions and to achieve a new nuclear deal with the u.s. jennifer reports tonight from the pentagon.(begin

being held in prison by tehran as human bargaining chips, among them emad shargi, a 56-year-old american businessmen.bahareh shargi, husband imprisoned in iran: he was simply taken, you know, taken, yanked out of our life and without an explanation.griffin: he and his wife of 32 years inspired by travel shows and anthony bourdain, decided to visit tehran three years ago to see the country they left as children, a decision that would upend their lives. 15 secret police stormed their apartment at 2:30 in the morning and took the emad to tehran's notorious evin prison.shargi: i went there for two weeks every morning and it was as if they didn't know who i'm talking about until they finally told me your husband is here and will be here for a long time.griffin: emad shargi has not been charged or put on trial.shargi: nobody has seen him for five and a half months.griffin: his two daughters hannah and ariana described how hard it has been not having their father home with them in the u.s. he has missed both their college graduations and so much more.hannah shargi, daughter of emad shargi: our dad is really just the most incredible father in the world. he's extremely present. he shows up for you all the time, every single game. he is the person that we all turn to. he's the one who keeps our family together. he's the foundation of our family.what we do know is that he's an innocent american who's being held against his well unable to come home.griffin: six days after becoming secretary of state, antony blinken spoke to the families of all americans detained wrongfully overseas.anthony blinken, secretary of state: i'm determined to bring every american home. we have to take a stand against the arbitrary detention of citizens for political purposes.unidentified

elections.(begin video clip)youngkin: the current state of our schools is at the top of the list of concerns.mike emanuel, fox news channel chief washington correspondent (voice over): some key republicans are convinced running against critical race theory could be a winning issue. virginia republican nominee for governor glenn youngkin says parents are alarmed.youngkin: it's viewed as absolutely being a political agenda, not an educational curriculum. and oh, by the way, when i'm governor, we are not going to have critical race theory in our schools.emanuel: youngkin is likely to face former democratic governor terry mcauliffe in november. mcauliffe is fired back on twitter.

republican governors widely expected to run for president in 2024 ron desantis and kristi noem have banned critical race theory from classrooms in their states, suggesting this could be a key issue heading into 2024. democratic strategist leslie marshall says the gop could be going down the wrong path.leslie marshall, democratic strategist: republicans should be harping on immigration. that would be a smarter campaign slogan, if you will, than critical race theory. i think because a lot of voters left and right either don't care about it, don't fully understand it.(end videotape)emanuel

upon expansion of the u.s. supreme court had its first meeting today. it's an idea then senator joe biden once fiercely ridiculed. but things have changed. here is correspondent david spunt.(begin video tape)david spunt, fox news correspondent: an institution formed in 1790 is under a top to bottom review 231 years later. today a 36 member bipartisan panel met for the first time to discuss monumental changes to the supreme court. the commission, established by president biden, will look at the possibility of adding justices to the court, taking some away, and eliminating life tenure.bob bauer, supreme court commission co-chair: we really do not believe we can do this work without the benefit of the broadest diversity of perspectives.spunt: membership ranges from liberal harvard professor laurence tribe to former federal judge thomas griffith, a george w. bush appointee. the constitution does not establish a set number of justices. that's up to congress. there were initially six members of the high court, then five, then seven, then nine, down to eight, 10 for a while, back down to eight, before finally setting on nine a century-and-a-half ago.unidentified male: i will appoint justices who will not overtake to override the judgment of the congress.spunt: in 1937, president franklin d. roosevelt wanted 15 justices on the court, a plan called court packing. his plan failed. in 1983, a senator from delaware named joe biden called the idea, well --joe biden, (d) president of the united states: it was a bonehead idea.spunt: but some democrats in 2021 believe the idea is perfect.sen. ed markey, (d-ma): the united states supreme court is broken. it is out of balance.spunt: progressive democrats want to add as many as four justices to the court. the commission will put out a final report by november, but no formal recommendations. any changes would be up to congress.paul smith, georgetown university law center: if the democrats had done much, much better in the election than they did, i think there might be some momentum. but at this point, with a 50-50 senate, it's just not happening.(end video tape)spunt (on camera): in addition to potential hurdles passing the senate, house speaker nancy pelosi, bret, said that she has no plans to bring any legislation that would alter the number of justices on the court to the house floor. bret?baier: david spunt outside the supreme court. david, thank you.up next, president biden is pushing israeli prime minister netanyahu to draw down, but giving russian leader vladimir putin a win. our panel trying to make sense of the foreign policy after the break.(commercial break)(begin video clip)sen. mitch mcconnell, (r-ky) senate minority leader: rather than having israel's back, senior democrats have actually pressured israel to end its defensive operations. they have called for a ceasefire and urged leaders to strive for peace through a negotiated two-state solution.rep. ro khanna, (d-ca) house armed services committee: netanyahu is out there saying that he has a blank check from the united states. that's what he is saying. he said this is going to go on for more time and that the united states is with him. no, we are not. there are many members of congress, including supporters of the u.s.-israel relationship like myself and others, who are saying that netanyahu does not have a blank check.(end video clip)baier: well, the white house dealing very vocal members of their democratic caucus up on the hill about the issue of israel, it actions against hamas. the white house putting out a readout the call with the israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu. ""president biden spoke with israeli prime minister netanyahu today. the two had a detailed discussion on the state of events in gaza, israel's progress in degrading the capabilities of hamas, and other terrorist elements, and ongoing diplomatic efforts by regional governments and the united states. the president conveyed to the prime minister that he expected a significant de-escalation today on the path to a ceasefire."" no indication yet that that has happened. we'll see if it does.let's bring in our panel, bill bennett, former education secretary, host of ""the bill bennett show"" podcast, susan page, washington bureau chief at ""usa today"" and the author of the book ""madam speaker, nancy pelosi and the lessons of power,"" and ben domenech, publisher of ""the federalist."" susan, speaking about speaker pelosi, she is having to kind of let her caucus speak its mind on this foreign policy issue. but the biden administration seems to be trying to tiptoe through all of that.susan page, washington bureau chief, ""usa today"": i think president biden had hoped to be as little engaged in this as possible. he certainly hasn't been as outspoken as some even in his own party had hoped he would be. got a little farther forward today in his conversation with netanyahu.but of course, democrats are divided on the issue of the conflict between israelis and palestinians, and there are significant number on the progressive side who thinks the united states should do much more to protect palestinians even at the cost of pressuring our long-time ally, israel. it is a difficult situation for the president, and it's one that i think pelosi is well aware of because she has all these different voices in other own caucus.baier: ben, republicans obviously are jumping on this, saying that there is a hamas caucus within the democratic party.ben domenech, publisher, ""the federalist"": it is not a difficult situation for the president. the president ought to stand with israel as america's longtime ally in the middle east. but unfortunately, i think we see a situation here that the iranians are looking to exploit. they have been on their heels thanks to the last four years of the trump administration, which saw them really hurt in a lot of different ways, both seeing the top of their military exercise essentially knocked off, thanks to both the israelis and the americans, but, also, i think they see a situation where they are trying to seize this moment to lean in to this new administration, which has a lot of distrust with israel and with bibi netanyahu and in trying to essentially attain a new dynamic that would allow them to restore what they were trying to do back in 2015.unfortunately, i think we are seeing a situation where the incompetence of the biden administration, their inconsistency when it comes to foreign policy, is leading to benefits for our enemies overseas.baier: bill, there are some experts, foreign policy experts, not just republicans, who say that this all points to iran and its ability to funnel funds to hamas and to produce this moment.bill bennett, former education secretary: well, certainly the funds that went to iran were used to make these rockets, which are being launched into israel. and i think bibi netanyahu will stand his ground, as i know him, he will. but, further, we are now talking about giving iran more money, remember, going back to the table, which means potentially fueling more of this, giving them more funds to produce more rockets.i will split the difference between susan and ben. i agree with ben it's not difficult in terms of right and wrong here. who started this fight and why did they start it, because they think there should be an end to the state of israel. but it's a difficult situation for biden because he doesn't know what he thinks. and he is being pressured by the left caucus and, of course he also wants to keep good relations with our greatest ally in the world. bibi netanyahu knows who he is, knows who he is, knows what he wants to do. biden is in the process of figuring it out. welcome to the job, mr. president.baier: meantime, this nord stream 2 pipeline under construction, russia desperately wants it to be completed to go into germany. there is a lot of thought about it as you look at the graphic of where it goes. it's not finished yet. there were stiff sanctions that are being lifted on the company that's constructing it. and there is some more reaction to all of that.(begin video clip)jennifer granholm, energy secretary: i understand the state department soon is going to be releasing a report regarding the mandatory sanctions that congress has imposed in assisting on the building of nord stream 2, and i understand that the state department is going to notify congress soon.michael burgess, (r-tx) house energy and commerce committee: i would love to see the argument how this waiver, which benefits, seemingly to me, benefits only vladimir putin, and we've already disadvantaged the citizens of the united states by not completing the last 100 yards of the keystone pipeline. so i don't quite follow how that waiver in the national interest occurs.(end video clip)baier: susan, what about this and how it plays?page: bill bennett said welcome to the job, mr. president. it is true that the job is a tough one, involves balancing interest. this is another example of that. this is not intended as a decision to help russia. that's a side effect. this is intended as a decision to help germany, which wanted very much the completion of the pipeline. it puts the administration in this awkward situation which we have heard about. tony blinken when he was in his confirmation hearings as secretary of state says the united states, the biden administration would actively oppose completion of this pipeline. but i think when the balance of interest came out, they came out in a different position on that. and so russia reaps the benefits of the desire of germany to get this pipeline completed.baier: that is what the administration is saying, but it is interesting just in the context of the german elections are coming. angela merkel's term as chancellor is going to be over come september. and the leading party, ben, is the green party, which actually is opposed to nord stream 2 in germany. so you are going to have all kinds of things happening potentially in coming months.domenech: there's a lot of moving parts here. and i think that one of the things that we really have to appreciate about this decision is that it really undermines nato in a lot of different ways. it does not serve our interest in terms of benefiting russia's ability to influence europe. and i think that one of the things that obviously president biden ran on as a candidate was his criticism of the trump administration as being too soft on russia in a lot of different respects. you can debate whether that was true, but from my perspective, what we have seen in the early days from this administration is not something that indicates a hard line toward russia.i will be very curious to see if in their conversation vladimir putin and joe biden in the coming weeks, if they have any kind of conversation that includes the name navalny. that is something that i think may not happen, and if that does not happen, it's an indication that this is an administration that is not willing to really stand up and hold the russian's feet to the fire.baier: the opposition leader in russia against putin.very quickly, bill, this story against ben sasse, senator sasse, having a problem in grilling this nominee for general counsel for the department of national intelligence because he did work for huawei, the chinese telecommunications company that has been under fire and under sanction by the u.s. if through the prism of this happened in the trump administration, how would it look tonight?bennett: well, everything would look different, and to the media everything would be different. ben sasse can be very wrong in my view, can be out on a limb sometimes. but today or yesterday he was right. this very experienced washington hand, this lawyer, acting as if he was just helping with administrative rules, when these administrative rules are things they can get around so huawei can continue its efforts. and, remember, this is a regime that persecute the uyghurs, and we know about huawei's role in that. it's really disgusting what's going on there.baier: all right, panel, stand by.up next, commissions, one on the supreme court expansion, the other on looking into january 6th and the capitol riot.(commercial break)baier: moments ago on the house floor, the vote was finished and there was a majority of the house that voted to establish the independent commission to look into january 6th, the riot that happened. there was opposition on the gop side to that.we're back with the panel. ben, there are people saying why oppose it, it's going to go forward? why not look at it? what about that?domenech: well, i think that the democrats in the house are designed to try to -- or focused basically on trying to exploit what happened on january 6th to continue to maintain the idea that there is some kind of radical element within american society that is bent on overthrowing the government. and that's something that, frankly, i think reasonable people will understand is not something that has happened.john katko, who is the representative on the republican side who had tried to negotiate something here, kind of got over his skis on this a little bit. he didn't really actually interface as much with republican leadership as he probably ought to in order to try to attain something that would be reasonable in this vein.but look, there is no real reason to support this. we all know what happened. we all know what the straightforward result of it was. and i think that frankly this is a situation where democrats are trying to exploit what happened for political gain and to continue to maintain a situation that leads to a militarized capitol hill, and the idea that there are creeping white supremacists organizations designed on overthrowing our government, which is simply not the case.baier: susan, democrats say we need to know what happened specifically, and that the former president doesn't know or acknowledge what happened specifically, so that it doesn't happen again.page: i don't know what happened. there are lots of questions that i think have not been answered about what led up to the insurrection and about what exactly was prevented from having happened because of the brave work of capitol police officers. i think there are a lot of questions that are still unanswered.the interesting thing about the vote you just showed, 35 republicans defected even though their leader said vote against this, 35 republicans supported it. in this day and age, that is a real display of bipartisanship. now, it's going to have a tough road in the senate. but that means that for at least those 35 republicans they also have some questions they think this is an issue that is worth some future scrutiny.baier: that commission is going forward. we will follow all elements of that. meantime the supreme court commission, take a listen to this on court-packing.(begin video clip)joe biden, (d) president of the united states: i would not get into court packing. we had three justices. next time around we lose control, they had three justices. we began to lose any credibility the court has at all.cristina rodriguez, supreme court commission co-chair: president biden established this commission as you all know, and he charged us with producing a report within 180 days of this meeting that provides an account, in the words of the order, of the contemporary commentary and debate about the role of the supreme court in our system of government. we will actually assess the calls for reform themselves to assess the arguments for why reform is pressing as well as why it might not be.(begin video clip)baier: bill, there's a lot of people that look at this and say, hey, there is no chance. this is not going forward. but other people look at it and say it's the camel's nose under the tent, that some reform leads to something that's changes the judiciary as we know it.bennett: well, it's also to take on another american institution. anyone detect a pattern here? the president first day says no xl pipeline. doesn't like american oil, but seems to like russian oil. doesn't like america's strongest ally so much, but is willing to support iran, one of america's greatest enemies. and now let's attack a key american institution, just like the electoral college and so on.yes, this is going to lead to a lot of mischief, and this is the democrats' plan. it's beginning to seem that there are a lot of themes that the democrats are developing that kind of strike at the heart of what traditional america means and believes in. and let's see how much further this develops. i can't make any sense out of a lot of these policies.baier: well, 2022, we'll figure some things out. we'll see.when we come back, tomorrow's headlines tonight with the panel.(commercial break)baier: finally tonight, a look at tomorrow's headlines with the panel. bill, first to you.bennett: ok, i'll compress my english headline into latin ""odi profanum vulgus,"" i hate the vulgar crowd. there is something about this biden crowd which really hates a lot of american things. americans like cars and oil. we hate them. if america loves israel, we're going to put the brakes on that. supreme court, america likes the way it is? we are going to change it. how about traditional american history? let's trash that, too. what is this contempt for the most ways americans think and believe?baier: all right, the latin headline tonight. susan?page: i'm sticking to english. back to benghazi. if the senate does not approve this january 6th commission, as we think it probably won't, nancy pelosi has indicated that she will appoint a select committee like the benghazi committee to look into the events of that day.baier: wow. here we go. ben?domenech: i can't compete with bill. this is incredible.(laughter)domenech: media tries to make kamala harris happen and it is still not happening. she is down double digits according to the latest polls in terms of her approval from voters and in terms of her approval from independents. she is not someone who is popular with the american people.baier: all right, panel, thank you. nice job.tomorrow on special report interview with virginia republican gubernatorial nominee glenn youngkin.thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. that's it for this special report, fair, balanced, and still unafraid. fox news primetime hosted by will cain this week starts right now. hey,

palestinians left almost 300 dead.president biden is walking a fine line, promising to rearm israel whileworking to provide humanitarian aid to gaza. and he's also dealing with asharp split among democrats about support for israel.in a moment, we'll speak with mark regev, senior advisor to israeli primeminister netanyahu.but, first, let's turn to mark meredith at the white house with the lateston the conflict and the politics here at home -- mark.mark meredith, fox news correspondent: chris, president biden has spent alot of time on the phone lately, urging palestinian and israeli officialsto stop fighting and as you mention, while the cease-fire is holding today,the president is facing a long list of questions about how he hopes toachieve lasting peace in the middle east.(begin videotape)biden: i'm praying this ceasefire will hold. i take bibi netanyahu when hegives me his word, i take him at his word.meredith (voice-over):the u.s. says it firmly supports israel's right todefend itself from terrorist groups like hamas but some progressives sayit's the israelis who need to be reined in.sen. bernie sanders (i-vt): we should be bringing people together, notjust being one-sided and saying everything that israel does is good,because it is not.meredith: in the wake of civilian deaths in gaza, some democrats want thewhite house to cancel a massive arms deal to israel. republicans say it'sproof democrats are divided.mcconnell: i think at least half the democrats are hostile to israel andthe rest of them are afraid to those who are hostile to israel.meredith: violence abroad has many fearful of increased anti-semiticattacks at home. cellphone cameras capturing multiple violent incidentswith los angeles police investigating a fight at a restaurant as a possiblehate crime.(end videotape)meredith (on camera):secretary of state antony blinken is set to visitthe middle east in coming days. he's expected to meet israeli, palestinianand regional leaders, all of whom who may be crucial to keeping thisceasefire in place -- chris.wallace: mark meredith reporting from the white house -- mark, thank you.and joining us now from jerusalem, mark regev, senior advisor to israeliprime minister netanyahu.ambassador, how confident are you that this ceasefire will last? back in2014, the last major outbreak of violence, it took nine truces over 56 daysbefore israel and hamas finally stopped fighting.what are the chances we're going to see that again?mark regev, senior adviser to israeli pm benjamin netanyahu: well, asyou've just said, after that round of fighting in 2014, we did receive overhalf a decade of relative peace and quiet. and so, that is possible and ihope we can do that again.ultimately, in the operation, we gave hamas a heavy blow. we dismantled alarge part of their terrorist military machine. we took out part of theirleadership. we hit their command and control.hopefully, they will think twice, even three times before they strike inisrael again.wallace: there is no question that hamas started the military conflict,firing 4,300 rockets into israel and killing at least a dozen israelis. buti think you would agree that the toll was much heavier on the hamas side,in gaza.now, i want to put up some numbers on that. at least 248 palestinianskilled, including 66 children and 39 women; 800,000 people in gaza do notcurrently have access to piped water.ambassador, any second thoughts about whether the israeli response duringthese 11 days was proportionate?regev: they were firing thousands of rockets, as you just said, on ourcivilian population. they were trying to murder our people in their homes.we were defending ourselves. our operation was fundamentally designedsimply to protect our civilian population.now, in the process of fighting back, we were trying to be a surgical as ishumanly possible, in a very complex, combat situation. they were firing outof schools. they were firing out of built up areas. they were firing out ofhomes, out of mosques, even out of playgrounds.and we tried to be, as i said, to hit the terrorists and not to seeinnocent people caught up in the crossfire.and while our goal was to avoid civilian casualties, hamas had actually theexact opposite goal. they were aiming their rockets at our people, tryingto kill them, and, of course, they were brutally abusing gaza civilians asa human shield for their war machine.we know for a fact that many of the casualties in this operation werecaused by hamas munitions. almost 20 percent of their rockets fell short,landing in gaza, killing gaza civilians. it didn't bother them at all, theykept doing that.part of the death and destruction was because of their ordnance, theirexplosives going off. we made a maximum effort to minimize humancasualties, they did exactly the opposite.wallace: one difference is that this time, israel came under some heavyfire from the left wing of the democratic party. and i want to play some ofthe clips of that kind of rhetoric this past week.take a look, sir.(begin video clip)rep. rashida tlaib (d-mi): palestinians aren't going anywhere no matterhow much money you send to israel's apartheid government.rep. ilham omar (d-mn):every rocket and bomb that target civilians is awar crime.sen. bernie sanders (i-vt): benjamin netanyahu has cultivated anincreasingly intolerant and authoritarian type of racist nationalism.(end video clip)wallace:ambassador, do you worry that israel is losing support among somemajor political elements here in the united states? and to what degree thatyou're losing that support does that bolster hamas and hurt israel?regev: well, i can tell you this morning before coming to this interview,i looked at the polling. and i saw that the overwhelming majority of theamerican people stand with israel, support israel, are favorable towardsisrael. a majority of people who identify as democrats also support israelor favor israel.and even i saw group -- people who self identify as liberal democrats arefavorable towards israel. of course, they want to see peace, but israelwants to see peace too. we'd love to have peace with our palestinianneighbors.and people need to understand -- hamas is not just israel's enemy. hamas isthe enemy of everyone who wants to seek peace and reconciliation in ourpart of the world. there were brutal jihadist terrorist group. no oneshould make excuses for them.wallace: so how do you understand, how do you regard the criticism you'regetting from rashida tlaib and ilhan omar and alexandria ocasio-cortez, andin addition from much more mainstream democrats -- for instance, thechairman of the senate foreign relations committee, robert menendez?regev: so, senator menendez is a champion of the israel-u.s. partnership,a champion of the alliance between our two democracies, a real friend ofisrael.i think we weren't quick enough. he was particularly concerned about anattack on a particular structure and we weren't quick enough in our -- thefacts of that matter out because it was played that somehow israel attackedinnocent civilians. it wasn't the case.in that building that the senator was concerned about, hamas had its elitescientific research unit that was working on ways to try to counteract theguiding systems on our rockets. if they would have succeeded, not onlycouldn't we have shut down incoming rockets coming into israel to kill ourpeople, but we wouldn't have been able to be surgical in our strikesagainst hamas' military machine, so that definitely was a legitimatemilitary target.that hamas was using journalists as a human shield shouldn't come as asurprise to anyone but we notify the journalists in advance and i'm happyto tell you that there was not a single civilian casualty from thatoperation. in fact, from my point of view, it was an israeli tacticalsuccess because we took out a legitimate hamas target, a dangerous hamastarget and at the same time, not a single innocent civilian was killed.that's a good thing.wallace: one concern -- you talked about israel wants peace. one concernis whether israel is doing enough to address the root causes of theconflict. here is a comment on friday from president biden.(begin video clip)joseph r. biden, president of the united states: we still need a two-statesolution. it is the only answer.(end video clip)wallace: does prime minister netanyahu still believe that a two-statesolution is the only answer? and if so, what is he doing to achieve that?regev: i know my prime minister believes in peace very, very strongly. inthe last year, he -- we've made it through peace agreements with four arabcountries and we want to see more. he wants to expand the circle of peaceto include the palestinians as well.but let me be clear here, hamas is not interested in peace. hamas says thatevery israeli man, woman, and child is a legitimate target in their terrorwar. hamas says israel, my country, should be destroyed, wiped off the map.hamas says any arab or palestinian leader who makes peace with israelshould be murdered. i think in overcoming hamas and defeating hamas now,maybe we've created some room for more palestinian moderate voices to movecenter stage because as long as hamas is powerful, they can almost put aveto.wallace: yes, but, you know, there are a number of independent groups thatsay it's not all hamas. the human rights group human rights watch came outwith a report last month that made a serious charge against israel for thefirst time. i want to put it up on the screen.they said the oppression of palestinians there in israel has reached athreshold and a permanence that meets the definitions of the crimes ofapartheid and persecution.ambassador, it says that israel has set up a system that oppressespalestinians, especially in gaza and the west bank.regev: i'd like to say when that report was issued, we read it carefullyand we rejected it. it's simply not true.israel is a democracy. it's a country with a free pass, a free parliament,a country where we hold our freedoms very, very seriously.we are in conflict with neighbors, especially in gaza, run by brutalterrorist organizations. there's no parity here. you have a democraticcountry trying to protect its people and a brutal terrorist organizationtrying to kill civilians. we have to act to protect our people.wallace: finally, and i have about a minute left, ambassador.with the -- in the -- there was an anti-netanyahu coalition that wasreportedly within days, perhaps within hours, of forming a government andousting prime minister netanyahu. now that we've had these 11 days ofconflict, is that dead? and is israel headed for a fifth election in twoyears?regev: you know, chris, this might be the land of the bible, but i'm noprophet and i can't foretell the future. i don't know what will happen herepolitically.i do know this: israelis across the political spectrum were united in theneed to defend our people against these hamas rockets coming in and theneed to take action and to stop it, and i think also israelis were unitedwall to wall in our appreciation for the president, for president biden,when he again and again reaffirmed israel's right to defend ourselvesagainst these incoming rockets. it was much appreciated.wallace:ambassador regev, thank you. thanks for your time. we'll befollowing developments in the region over next days and weeks.up next, we'll ask our sunday panel about the new controversy over u.s.support for our oldest ally in the middle east.(commercial break)(begin video clip)biden: i think that, you know, my party still supports israel.rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez (d-ny): do palestinians have a right tosurvive? do we believe that?(end video clip)wallace:congresswoman alexandria ocasio-cortez contradicting presidentbiden's claim there is no split inside the democratic party over israel.and it's time now for our sunday group, guy benson of fox news radio; juliepace, washington bureau chief for ""the associated press""; and charles lanefrom ""the washington post.""julie, how much do you think the growing criticism from some democrats andas i mentioned in the last interview, especially from the chairman of thesenate foreign relations committee, robert menendez -- how much do youthink that criticism rattled the biden white house and pushed them to goharder and sooner for a ceasefire from israel?julie pace, washington bureau chief, the associated press: i think thewhite house was certainly aware that the democratic party is split overthis issue, that there is a much more vocal element of the democratic partythat is supporting the palestinian cause, that is not as reflexively pro-israel as we have seen in the past.i do think biden, though, was trying to walk this very careful line. yousaw this over and over again in statements that he was making in readoutsof the conversations that he was having with prime minister netanyahu, withthe conversations that tony blinken, lloyd austin, and others were having.the thing they put forward there at the forefront was, we support israel'sright to defend itself. they felt like it was critical to have thatstatement out there. but you did see then over the course of this conflicta move, privately at first, and then publicly to urge israel to stop.i don't think that was driven fairly by politics but certainly the politicswas something the white house was well aware of here.wallace: guy, i think it's fair to say that president biden stood prettyfirmly behind israel throughout this conflict, but you know, whether it wasthe squad, whether it was senator menendez, whether it was senator berniesanders, you have talk of apartheid, of racism, and war crimes. what do youmake of that?guy benson, ""the guy benson show"": yeah, chris, i listen to your interviewin the last segment very carefully and i hope that the ambassador is rightabout america remaining steadfastly pro-israel across-the-board and he saidhe looked at some polling.there's a new poll out in the last few days of yougov that shows when theyasked democrats which side of this conflict they sympathize more with, moredemocrats say palestinians than israelis. i think it that is anextraordinary sea change that we're seeing in the democratic party. i thinksome of the old guard remains pro-israel but the younger, very vocal sortof up-and-coming element of the progressive left, they have cast in theirlot with the palestinians and i think in some cases amplify what amount tohamas talking points.i think it's frightening to see. i think republicans are much more unitedon this front, independents remain heavily pro-israel. but there is a realfight here in the democratic party over this issue.wallace: chuck, let me pick up on that. do you think the real story, thebig story here is that the continuing support for israel among mostamerican politicians, republicans and democrats, or this growing criticismof israel from the left wing of the democratic party?chuck lane, fox news contributor: i would put it this way: whencommentators in the palestinian community claimed victory in this contestthat has perhaps just concluded, the main point they cited was the growthof support for the palestinian cause in global opinion, particularly theunited states.i don't think they are wrong to see it that way. they paid a heavy pricemilitarily, but in public opinion around the world on the progressive left,the palestinian cause is now seeing, ironically, almost as sympatheticallyas the jewish and israeli cause was seen 60 years ago.i think it's been a long time coming. there are a lot of reasons for that.certainly in the united states, one reason is that prime minister netanyahumade a very overt pro-donald trump, pro-republican kind of lunge over thelast four years and that alienated a lot of democrats. he became morepartisan.and i think now we are going to see in our country, israel, the middleeast, become a much more partisan issue with democrats on one side of itrelatively speaking and republicans on the other.wallace: let's turn to the facts on the ground. here was prime ministernetanyahu this week. take a look.(begin video clip)benjamin netanyahu, israeli prime minister: you can either conquer them,and that's always an open possibility, or you can deter them. and we areengaged right now in forceful deterrence but i have to say we don't ruleout anything.(end video clip)wallace: julie, under president trump, i think it's fair to say that thepush for the two-state solution, the traditional diplomatic position of theunited states was put on the shelf and you saw a much greater effort toachieve these abraham accords between israel and other arab countries likeqatar and the united arab emirates. but didn't these last 11 days show thatyou just can't ignore the central conflict between israel and thepalestinians?pace: or that if you do ignore it, that it's not going to get any betteron its own and it will continue to flare up and continue to push its way tothe forefront here. and i think what's interesting is that when joe bidencame into office, he didn't put the middle east, he certainly didn't putthe israeli-palestinian issue at the forefront of his foreign policy. hewanted to focus on rebuilding global alliances, he wanted to focus on asiamore, trying to counter china.and i think with these last 11 days have shown is that a u.s.administration, whether it wants to or not has to deal with this situation.i think what we're going to be watching for in the coming weeks and monthsis what the biden position is going to be here. how actively involved ishis administration going to get in trying to potentially restart peacetalks here that the region has changed, you do have these peace accords nowbetween israel and some arab countries. that is an important dynamic thathas shifted here, but the biden demonstration has a choice now to makeabout what their own approaches going to be and how active and central thiswill be to the president's foreign policy.wallace: and, of course, adding to all the difficulties, you've got thishuge split inside israel, the netanyahu forces and the anti-netanyahuforces as we may be headed to the fifth election in two years and a hugeand growing split among the palestinians between the more establishmentfatah wing and hamas. so if you are further away from the peace deal andever.panel, we have to take a break here. we'll see later in the hour.up next, a bipartisan commission to investigate the events of the january6th attack on capitol hill faces an uphill battle in the senate. we'll talkto two key republicans on opposing sides of the issue when we come rightback.(commercial break)wallace: coming up, the fate of the january 6th commission is now in thehands of a divided senate.(begin video clip)mcconnell: i made the decision to oppose the house democrats' slanted andunbalanced proposal.schumer: shame on the republicans for choosing the big lie over the truth.(end video clip)wallace: we'll ask our sunday panel whether congress will approve it.(commercial break)wallace: majority leader chuck schumer plans to bring a bill to the senatefloor soon creating a commission to investigate the january 6th attack onthe u.s. capitol. but republicans appear to have the votes to kill themeasure.there is a sharp split inside the gop about the need for an independentcommission. in a moment, we'll speak with a member of the senateleadership, roy blunt, who says the panel will only slow down reforms thatare already underway, but first, from illinois, republican congressman adamkinzinger.congressman, after the house approved the commission with 35 republicans inthe house breaking with the gop leadership to support the panel, itappeared that there was a possibility congress was going to approve thiscommission.but then, the senate republican leader mitch mcconnell spoke out this week.take a look at what he had to say.(begin video clip)sen. mitch mcconnell (r-ky), minority leader: it's not at all clear whatnew facts or additional investigation yet another commission could actuallylay on top of existing efforts by law enforcement and congress.(end video clip)wallace:congressman, with several congressional committees in both thehouse and senate investigating the events of january 6th, are therequestions? and if so, what are they, the biggest questions that you think acommission would be able to answer but that these committees will not beable to answer?rep. adam kinzinger (r-il): yeah, certainly. so let's keep in mind theinvestigations that are ongoing things like into specific criminal actions.that's why you've seen 400 people arrested. that's what the fbi can do.there can be discussions about, you know, did the house security fail? butwhat we need is a comprehensive look at what happened that led up tojanuary 6th, who was talking to who? what were the lies?and here's the truth, chris, the american people -- and it's sunday and youlearned in sunday school, truth matters. the american people deserve thetruth.and my party to this point have said things like it was hugs and kisses, itwas antifa and blm, it was anything but what it was, which was a trump-inspired insurrection on the capitol. and people deserve to hear the truth.and i think now what's going to happen if this thing fails is that nancypelosi will run a select committee and this could go all the way to 2024.chris wallace, fox news anchor: why do you think that senate republicans,led by mitch mcconnell, are apparently going to be able to block thiscommission? do you think it's all about politics on their part?and don't they have a point that one of the reasons the democrats arepushing so hard for this commission is because they want to bring thecontroversy over what happened on january 6th and over the alleged rolethat donald trump played in it, they want to bring that into the 2022midterms?kinzinger: well, you know, here's a revelation, this is going to the 2022midterms anyway, particularly if us as republicans don't take ownership forwhat happened, if every other day, there's a new conspiracy theory aboutwhat happened at the capitol, anybody but what it was. and so, yeah, that ithink it will go to 2022. and we'll look like we are just sitting heredenying reality and facts.i get it, it may have a political impact, but i'm going to tell you whathad a political impact on 2022, if anything does, it's going to be theattack on january 6th and then the subsequent denial to look in the mirror,tell the truth, take ownership for what we've done and recommit to tell theamerican people and republican voters the truth. the republican voter whohas had their patriotism abused by somebody that simply wants to use it tomaintain power.raw and noble patriotism is beautiful and leaders should be inspiring thatpatriotism to defend democracy and not attack it.wallace: let me ask you about one republican leader in congress.do you believe that it's a conflict of interest for house republican leaderkevin mccarthy to do everything he can to oppose this panel, do you thinkit's a conflict of interest given that he would likely be called by acommission to testify about his various conversations with president trumpboth on the day of the riot on january 6th and then subsequent to that?kinzinger: well, i wouldn't say it's a conflict of interest because kevinis the leader. there's probably a lot of people that are going to besubject to being called in front of any investigation on this, evencriminal investigation.but i do think kevin has failed to tell the truth to the republicans and tothe american people and it pains me to say. it's not like i enjoy standingup and saying this, but people, the 74 million voters that voted for donaldtrump, the belief -- a number of them that believe the election was stolenbelieve it because their leaders have not told them otherwise. the peoplethey trust have either been silent or not told them the truth.that's where kevin has failed, because he told the truth on january 13th,something around then, and then he went to mar-a-lago and said donald trumpis the leader of the party. he's right. donald trump is the leader of theparty, but we need to tell people the truth.wallace: you talk about the politics in all this on the part of therepublicans who are trying to block the commission but you have set up apolitical action committee called ""country first"" and part of the goal,maybe the central goal of ""country first"" is to try and take the republicanparty back from donald trump.so, in effect, doesn't the january 6th commission serve your politicalpurposes?kinzinger: no, not at all, because when i tell you, history is going totell the truth anyway. it would be nice to confront that through january6th commission. my whole thing with ""country first"" -- and it'scountry1st.com -- is just simply to say we owe the american people thetruth.my very first video on there, i just say, look, the republican party haslost its way. this party that built the interstate system, that freed theslaves, you know, fought for the environment, is now the party that isengaged heavily in mass battles, anti-vaccination and whatever the outrageof the day is, including dr. seuss.all that may be important but there are much more important things for thiscountry. and that's what we want to get back to, is putting the countrybefore the party. and frankly, january 6th embarrasses me. that will in noway benefit me at all.wallace:congressman kinzinger, thank you. thanks for sharing this weekendwith us.and now let's turn to senator roy blunt of missouri.senator, you're a member of the republican leadership in the senate. howconfident are you that you're going to be able to block the creation ofthis commission in the senate?sen. roy blunt (r-mo): well, i think it's to too early to create acommission and i -- i believe republicans in the senate will decide thatit's too early to -- to create that commission.you know, commissions often don't work at all. and when they do work, likethe simpson-bowles commission produced a good result, nothing happened as a-- as part of that result.the one commission that we generally think did work was the 9/11commission, chris. i think that was -- i was part of putting thatcommission together. i think it was 14 months after 9/11, after all kindsof other information was out there for that commission to look at, beforethat commission got started. and, believe me, it would be months beforethis commission could get started.i just was part of the senate intel committee looking into the lastelection, the russian involvement in the last election. we thought thatwould take a year. it took three years. and we already had a full staffthat was fully cleared to look at everything. it would take months, aschairman burr said the other day, former chairman burr of -- of ourcommittee, would take months just to get a staff ready to look at thingsand you've got 400 plus legal efforts going on against individuals. that'sgoing to produce a lot of information eventually.but, believe me, the justice department will not let a commission have anyof that information. we just went through that with the -- with the 9 --with the effort we looked at after the last election. we got no sharingfrom the justice department about a much smaller number of cases thanthey're dealing with now.this information is all going to get out there. i've actually opposed theidea of a commission from -- immediately from the very first because ithink we'll start waiting for a commission rather than moving forward withwhat we know we need to do now.there's a bipartisan effort in the senate with two committees to producenot only a report, but also a number of recommendations, and we should beable to do that in the first full week of june and we haven't even waitedfor that to decide what a commission should do.wallace: well, let me ask you about that.you are working with two committees, senate rules and senate homelandsecurity. both, of course, chaired by democrats because they're in themajority.blunt: right.wallace: and, as you say, they're going to come out with a report, wethink, as early as -- as next month. but the issue is whether or notthey're going to answer -- and this is what congressman kinzinger said --some of the key questions that a lot of people have about january 6th.i want to put those up on the -- on the screen. what was president trumpdoing during the riot? did he refuse to approve sending in the nationalguard? did white house staff and the military work around mr. trump withvice president pence?will your report, with those two committees, will they answer thosequestions, and have you talked, have you subpoenaed, or have you heard fromtop officials in the trump white house?blunt: well, we had two public hearings and we've had several individualinterviews with people like the acting secretary of defense, the -- thesecretary of the army. there's going to be a timeline that will come outthat -- that talks about what happened, when it happened. there will beplenty of answers to the questions, i think, of why we had that 30 minutegap between the time that the defense department says they approvednational guard assistance and the time they told the national guard thatthey'd approved that assistance.wallace: but -- but, sir, what about --blunt: there are some questions there, but --wallace: i -- i don't mean to interrupt, but what about what was going oninside the trump white house?blunt: well, i -- i think you've got to decide, what's the priority here?is the priority to secure the capitol, to do what we need to do to bettertrain, better prepare capitol police, decide what we want to do in thefuture, or is the priority to take what will be a of couple years, in myview, to decide what happened inside the white house? i think thatultimately will be out there. all kinds of books being written, all kindsof efforts to look at that. even a commission like the 9/11 commissionstarted at the right time with the information they need, won't get in theway of us doing what we need to do.but if we start a commission right now, just last week many people in thepress were saying about our report that will come out, it will bebipartisan, it will be something that -- that chairman klobuchar, chairmanpeters, rob portman and i all will have signed off on.wallace: right.blunt: when that comes out, people are saying, well, maybe we should waituntil we get a report from the commission. i don't think we should wait foranother year or so to decide what we need to do to respond to 9/11.wallace: well, i -- but you keep talking about the 9/11 commission. the --the two chairs of the 9/11 commission, one republican, one democrat, theyput out a statement this week and -- and here's what they said. theysupport creation of this panel, saying, unity of purpose was key to theeffectiveness of the group, the 9/11 commission. we put country above partywithout bias.i -- you know, i don't think many people or anybody is saying that yourcommittees can't do their work. the question is whether the -- a -- acommission, an independent commission, no members of congress, could serve-- could serve a useful function. as you say, it may be a year from nowbefore they comes out.can you honestly say, in opposing this commission, down -- coming out downthe line, that you're putting country above party?blunt: well, i -- i think -- first of all, i think i said a minute ago whathappened on 9/11. obviously, what i meant what happened january 6th. thoseare clearly, in my time in -- in the congress, the two seminal moments werethe -- were the -- the country, the capital city itself under an attackthat we wouldn't have anticipated.but i -- i do think that the 9/11 commission had a lot more informationavailable to it when it started than this one would have and we made a lotof decisions before the 9/11 commission started that were important tofurther secure the capitol, to further look at our intelligence failures.wallace: right.blunt: we need to be doing all of those things. we'll see what mycolleagues think, but there have been very little bipartisan discussionsbetween the house and senate on this topic.wallace: senator, i want to -- i've got about 30 seconds here, so i need aquick answer.you're part of a republican group trying to come up with a deal with thewhite house over infrastructure. they're at $1.7 trillion. yu guys are --on the republican side are around $600 billion. even in washington, that'sa lot of money.what do you think of the prospects for a compromise, a bipartisancompromise on infrastructure? thirty seconds.blunt: well, i hope we can get there. i think our best meeting on thistopic was the meeting we had with the president himself and the members anda couple of cabinet officers, the secretary of commerce and the secretaryof transportation.i think the president would like to get there on a bipartisan deal. ourbiggest gap is not the money. our biggest gap is defining whatinfrastructure is. and if we get to a definition of infrastructure that thecountry would have always accepted, that becomes a much narrower space thanit appears to be right now.i do think we've got about a week or ten days to decide if we can worktogether on this or not. i'd like to. i believe the president would liketo. the number is too big because the scope of what the white house staffwants to call infrastructure is way too big.wallace: right.senator blunt, thank you. thanks for coming in today and we'll stay on topof what happens to the commission and the senate.blunt: thank you too (ph).wallace: up next, we'll bring back our sunday group to debate who's playingpolitics with this plan for an independent investigation.(commercial break)(begin video clip)sen. mitch mcconnell (r-ky): what is clear is that house democrats havehandled this proposal in partisan bad faith going right back to thebeginning.sen. chuck schumer (d-ny): once again they are caving to donald trump andproving that the republican party is still drunk off the big lie.(end video clip)wallace: senate republican and democratic leaders sharply divided over theidea of a commission to investigate the january 6th riot on capitol hill.and we're back now with the panel.so, guy, which side do you think has the better side of this argument, therepublicans who it appears are going to be able to block the commission ordemocrats were are pushing for it?guy benson, townhall.com, ""the guy benson show"" and fox newscontributor:well, the republicans may have the votes in the senate, as senator bluntalluded to.in terms of the argument, i heard what senator mcconnell just said there.and one person who would disagree is the republican ranking member on thehomeland security committee in the house who helped hammer out a bipartisandeal on this commission. and it's absolutely true that one way or anotherthere's going to be an investigation by congress into this attack oncongress, which was an extremely disgraceful moment in our history. thequestion is will it be bipartisan with each side having similar powers, notexactly the same, but the exact same number of people that they'reresponsible for appointing to it, or will it be a partisan, democratic-involved situation on enterprise that nancy pelosi will run? and that's thepoint that congressman kinzinger made.so i really do think that this is an appropriate purview for congress tolook into. it's not ancient history. the hands of congress are not tied togo do other things while a commission looks into everything that led up toand happened on that horrific day. and i think republicans are reallytrying to just sort of move past it and look to 2022. i'm sympathetic tothat. but i think 1/6 was bad enough that it requires real answers.wallace: chuck, even if republicans take a political hit in killing thecommission, as it at least appears now they're going to do, couldn't youargue that it's still smarter politics than creating this panel, which isgoing to hold public hearings and bring the whole issue -- i understand ifnot it will be like a benghazi commission, it will be set up just by oneparty, nanny pelosi in the house, but, you know, an independent commissionhas a real political downside to it as well for republicans.charles lane, ""the washington post"" and fox news contributor: theindependent commissions' political downside to the republicans is that ithas more credibility and, of course, this is a very bad story for therepublican party. i think a lot of republicans are afraid of what it willfind out about their desperate but futile effort to get the president to dosomething about this mob that was coming for them.but, more importantly, i think they feel -- the republicans feel that theyhave to move -- just like they had to squash liz cheney to change thesubject, they have to squash this to change the subject so they have aclearer field in 2022.i just want to say that, you know, this is one where the democrats aregalvanized and united and have sort of logic and truth in their directionand the republicans are divided and fighting against the pretty clearmerits of the subject.wallace: right.julie, let's talk about this not from a political standpoint but from asubstance standpoint. are there some questions that -- about presidenttrump's role before the -- the riot or -- or during the day, january 6th,that it commission might be able to answer and that these congressionalcommittees, and senator blunt made it clear they're not calling topofficials from the trump white house, that congressional committees arenever going to be able to answer?julie pace, washington bureau chief, ""the associated press"": absolutely. ithink the commission would be the perfect venue to try to answer some ofthe unanswered questions. and most of those questions do focus on presidenttrump, focus on what he was doing on the 6th, what private conversations hewas having with aides. we have snippets of details about conversations thathe was having with some members of congress and others but i do think thatthere's a real gap in the history of this seminal moment in our country'shistory that has gone unanswered. and so this commission would likely bethe only real venue for being able to have a fair accounting of whattranspired inside the white house and around president trump on the 6th.wallace: let's turn to another big issue that i touched on at the end of myinterview with senator blunt, and -- and that's the question of a biginfrastructure bill. president biden keeps saying he wants a compromise.but at the end of this week, as i mentioned to -- to senator blunt, thewhite house is at $1.7 trillion and democrats are about $600 billion. sothey're more than a trillion dollars apart.guy, what do you think of the chances they're able to -- to resolve thatdifference and also the difference of how they pay for it. democrats wantto raise taxes on corporations. republicans don't. or do you think in theend that the president and democrats will end up going the straight partyline reconciliation route in the senate?benson: a trillion dollars plus apart. and a huge disagreement on taxes. ahuge disagreement on scope, which i think was a key word from senator bluntin that interview.i think that there is some openness to bipartisanship on this on therepublican side. the white house has come down in their number a littlebit. it's still astronomically high. the republicans want to focus ontraditional infrastructure, which i think makes sense. maybe they'll get alittle bit closer.i'm currently, based on what i'm seeing, what i'm reading, what i'mhearing, i'm more inclined to believe this is going to end up being apartisan exercise by the democrats to sort of ram it through because theparties are so far apart.the one potential opportunity though, four senators, two from each party,put together a bipartisan bill on service infrastructure, roads and bridgesand that sort of thing for $303 billion. if they go at this on a piecemealbasis, then perhaps there's more room, more wiggle room for bipartisanship.but i think the white house wants something big.wallace: julie, i've got less than a minute. how do you think thisinfrastructure story ends?pace: i think unless there's a significant shift in the dynamics this week,we're either going to go down a -- a purely partisan route where a bigpackage gets passed only on democratic votes or there is this potentialopportunity to explore what guy just outlined there, where you break up thebill into some smaller pieces. but the white house officials that i'vetalked to are very concerned that taking that route would actually cause asplit within their own party where a lot of democrats want to use thisopportunity to do something big and so there's some weariness among whitehouse officials about doing that, doing that second step.wallace: well, we'll be talk about that a little bit longer.thank you, panel. see you next sunday.up next, our ""power player of the week,"" a d.c. landmark on surviving thepandemic and its special place in washington history.(commercial break)wallace: as the country begins to get back to normal, a lot of us arelooking forward to enjoying a meal

(ap photo/vahid salemi4)former israeli defense minister moshe yaalon, who fiercely opposed the original deal, was one of the rare israeli voices to argue against withdrawal at the time. he now says the u.s. pullout has turned out to be the ""main mistake"" in the region of the past decade.a flawed deal, he told a security conference last week, ""probably was better than not having the agreement and to allow the iranians to use the withdrawal as an excuse to go ahead with the project.""""now they are in the closest stage they have been ever to become a (nuclear) threshold state,"" he said.here’s a closer look at the deal and what to expect this week:why did the original deal collapse?the 2015 agreement between iran and world powers -- spearheaded by president barack obama -- aimed to prevent iran from being able to build a nuclear bomb. it offered iran relief from crippling economic sanctions in exchange for curbs of 10 to 15 years on its nuclear activities. iran says its nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes.critics, led by then-israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu, assailed the deal because the restrictions on iran were temporary. they also complained it did not address iran’s non-nuclear military activity -- such as its support for hostile militant groups and development of long-range missiles.when trump withdrew, with strong urging from netanyahu, he promised a campaign of ""maximum pressure"" on iran. however, the approach appears to have backfired. despite increased u.s. sanctions, iran’s government remains firmly in power, and the country has raced forward with nuclear research banned by the original deal. the flag of iran waves in front of the the international center building with the headquarters of the international atomic energy agency, iaea, in vienna, austria on monday, may 24, 2021. (ap photo/florian schroetter, file)can't the deal just be reinstated?iran began exceeding the limits of the agreement after the u.s. withdrawal, and now enriches small amounts of uranium up to 60% purity — a short step from weapons-grade levels of 90%. iran also spins advanced centrifuges once barred by the accord and its uranium stockpile now far exceeds the accord’s limits.experts say that even if iran were forced to give up its uranium stockpile or halt its research, the expertise it has gained cannot be taken away.what are the prospects for this week's talks?in the short term, it does not look encouraging. heading into the talks, iran’s hard-line president, ebrahim raisi, has made maximalist demands, including calls for the u.s. to unfreeze $10 billion in assets as an initial goodwill gesture.the tough line might be an opening gambit. european negotiators remain confident a deal will be reached in the short to medium term.but u.s. officials do not appear optimistic. president joe biden and his top advisers have held a series of meetings in recent weeks with key allies and negotiating partners to prepare for the possible failure of talks.because of trump's withdrawal, the americans won't even be in the negotiating room. instead, they will be nearby and work through mediators.in an interview broadcast friday, chief u.s. negotiator rob malley said signs from iran ""are not particularly encouraging.""speaking to npr, he said the u.s. prefers a diplomatic solution. but if that is impossible, he said the u.s. will respond accordingly. ""the options that are at america’s disposal are, you know, they’re familiar to all,"" he said.given the tepid u.s. response to alleged iranian military activity in the region, including attacks on civilian shipping in the persian gulf and a strike on a u.s. base in syria, u.s. military action does not seem to be a serious threat. the united states’ bungled pullout from afghanistan has further eroded american credibility in the region.""i’m very pessimistic,"" said yoel guzansky, a former official in the israeli prime minister’s office who is now a senior fellow at the institute for national security studies in tel aviv.

(ronen zvulun/pool via ap, file)what can israel do?israel is not a party to the talks, but it has a huge stake in the outcome.it considers iran to be its no. 1 enemy and views a nuclear-armed iran as an existential threat. israel is believed to be the only nuclear-armed state in the region, though it does not publicly acknowledge its own arsenal.netanyahu's successor, naftali bennett, has been careful not to clash with biden in public. but his positions are similar to netanyahu’s. he has expressed hope an improved deal would emerge from the talks but reiterated israel’s longstanding threat to take unilateral action if necessary.""we will maintain our freedom to act,"" he said last week. on sunday, he said israel is ""very disturbed"" by what he sees as a willingness by the global powers to lift sanctions and reinstate ""insufficient restrictions in the nuclear sphere."" he said israel has been passing this message to all concerned parties.former trump adviser says possible biden ‘plan b’ on iran nuclear deal ‘insane’despite such threats, israel might hesitate. iran has spent the past decade scattering its nuclear sites and hiding them deep underground. plus, israel might be reluctant to sabotage a global diplomatic effort.is iran overplaying its hand?china and russia, two important iranian outlets for trade and parties to the deal, could grow impatient with tehran, especially if a now-shaky system of international nuclear inspections falls apart. economic pressure continues to squeeze iranians, who have seen their savings evaporate with the free-fall of the country’s currency.click here to get the fox news appif talks drag on, the u.s. might turn to new sanctions or even military action. there’s also the risk of a military intervention by israel.""we’ll see in the coming days what exactly"" iran's approach will be, state department spokesman ned price said last week.

(credit: ariel tanaami/tps.)jerusalem – tuesday could be a big day for former israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu. as israelis returned to the polls for a fifth time in less than four years, the former israeli leader is growing increasingly hopeful that a whirlwind election campaign and more than a year in opposition will be enough to propel him back into power.however, his path to the premiership is complicated. first by the fact that he is currently embroiled in a high-profile criminal trial that includes charges of bribery, fraud, and breach of trust, and secondly by the other political parties he might need in order to build his future coalition, which includes a faction made up of controversial far right-wing politicians.netanyahu, the longest-serving leader in israel’s history, was ousted in the last round of voting in march 2021. since then, he has watched from the opposition bench as his rivals – first naftali bennett and now yair lapid – ran the country with a fragile government coalition that included, for the first time ever, a controversial party from the country’s minority arab sector.in an interview on friday with fox news digital, netanyahu said that he felt confident he could win this election and return to power with a more solid and ideologically aligned government. supporters of benjamin netanyahu take part in a rally oct. 28 in support of the former prime minister. voters go to the polls nov. 1 to decide on 'bibi's' immediate political future.

""any small changes in the vote choice between the camps or within the camps can have a significant impact,"" said dr. liron lavi, a lecturer in the department of political studies at bar ilan university.additionally, lavi pointed out that while netanyahu might certainly choose to form a government with the parties that have backed him through the campaign – two ultra-orthodox jewish parties and a nationalist religious party – if his own likud party succeeds in garnering a larger number of voters, he would be better positioned to negotiate an alternative coalition, possibly with the party headed by the current defense minister benny gantz. president biden is greeted by israeli prime minister yair lapid, and president isaac herzog, left, as during biden's visit to israel in july 2022.

""in this election, however, the size of the party is crucial, especially for likud, because a large likud will give netanyahu the flexibility to choose his coalition partners.""netanyahu has faced criticism both within israel and outside for saying he is willing to include the national religious party –religious zionism – in a future coalition. the confab, which consists of three far-right parties, features characters such as itamar ben-gvir, adisciple of the american rabbi and knesset member meir kahana, who was assassinated by aterrorist in new york in 1990, and bezalel smotrich, a former transport minister, who isan outspoken advocate for israeli settlement on lands palestinians hope for a future state.israel election: with divisions deepening, israelis to decide if netanyahu should return to power israeli far-right lawmaker and the head of the ""jewish power"" party itamar ben-gvir visits at hatikva market in tel aviv during his campaign ahead of the country's election on nov.1 as israel heads to its fifth election in under four years.

""for god sakes, we're the biggest party i'm the prime minister, and we control policy.""""i always questioned the people who level this question against me,"" he continued.""i said, where were you when the current government has made a coalition with the muslim brotherhood that wants to see the disappearance of israel and doesn't accept the united states as currently formed? how come you’re speaking of people who recognize the jewish state, who support the idf, or who have been cleared by our supreme court, which vets all the parties? it just doesn't make sense.""on monday, with less than 24 hours to go until the polls open, netanyahu made a dramatic announcement that he was growing concerned about voter turnout for those affiliated with likud and called an emergency strategy meeting at his headquarters in tel aviv. his failure to win 61 seats for his bloc or increase the size of his likud party could, this time, end his political career for good, some local pundits say. videoclick here to get the fox news appjonathan rynhold, who heads the department of political studies at bar ilan university, said that there was a good chance of netanyahu challenging the legitimacy of the election results if he did not get 61 seats.""he will have seen that trump did this and although i do not expect the equivalent of 6th jan. in israel, netanyahu can cause a lot of chaos in the political system if he challenges the results,"" said rynhold.
