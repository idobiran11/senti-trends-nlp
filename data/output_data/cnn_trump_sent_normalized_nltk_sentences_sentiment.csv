Why Biden is only just about to face his first veto,2023-03-03,"Spend some time reading about how the presidential veto has fallen into disuse and you can't help but think it coincides with an era where the filibuster and other forms of Capitol Hill obstruction have been put on steroids. It's an indication of how the constitutional vision of the US government -- with its separation of powers -- has contorted to what we have today, where very little can pass out of one branch of government and the executive is taking more and more power.  The Constitution spells out specific instructions for use of the veto as a means to separate power. The filibuster is a custom that isn't mentioned in the Constitution, but has complete control over modern Washington and is leaving a vacuum for presidents to fill.  Still, issuing a veto is a rite of passage for every modern president, and Joe Biden is about to experience his first. There are two issues where lawmakers from both chambers are testing Biden. An effort to overturn Biden's retirement investments option The first relates to a Biden administration retirement investment rule, which according to CNN's report, ""allows managers of retirement funds to consider the impact of climate change and other environmental, social and governance factors when picking investments."" Normally, Democrats would have used filibuster rules to block action against the rule in the Senate. But since lawmakers are looking to repeal an executive rule and not a law, Republicans were able to vote to repeal it on Wednesday with help from two red-state Democrats, Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Jon Tester of Montana. Biden is expected to veto the measure, which was passed by the House on Tuesday. It would take two-thirds supermajorities in both chambers (usually 67 of 100 senators and 290 of 435 representatives) to override the expected veto. Taking power from the DC city council As for the second issue testing Biden, there had been talk that the president could veto a bill pushed by congressional Republicans to invalidate the DC city council's effort to rewrite its criminal law. Critics argue the new law is soft on violent criminals.  But Biden told Democratic senators on Thursday that he won't use his veto power in this case and would sign the measure to repeal DC's new crime law. In a subsequent tweet, he noted, ""I support D.C. Statehood and home-rule -- but I don't support some of the changes D.C. Council put forward over the Mayor's objections -- such as lowering penalties for carjackings."" What a difference four years makes Regardless, it took more than two years to get to this point, when a Republican-controlled House is testing Biden and a slim Democratic majority in the Senate is unable to protect him from pulling out his veto pen. That it's taken more than two years for Biden to face his first veto, after Republicans took control of the House in January, is about in line with when former President Donald Trump issued his first veto, more than two years into his presidency. The levers of government were completely reversed back then. The Republican president was usually protected by a slim Republican majority in the Senate from legislation passed out of a House controlled by Democrats. Few recent vetoes The trend away from vetoes has carried through several presidents as use of the filibuster has increased.  Trump threatened to veto lots of things, but he only ended up issuing 10. Just one of those -- his veto of a bill to authorize defense spending -- was overridden.  Note: Read this explanation of the difference between a regular veto and a pocket veto. The latter occurs when a president simply declines to sign a bill and Congress goes into recess. But there hasn't been one of those in more than 22 years. Barack Obama issued 12 vetoes as president and also had one overridden. Lopsided votes in the House and Senate enacted a law allowing citizens to sue Saudi Arabia for the 9/11 attacks. George W. Bush was more than five years into his presidency before he issued his first veto, but there was a flurry of activity in his final two years, when he, like Obama, ultimately used his veto 12 items.  Unlike Obama, Bush had four vetoes overridden, although one of those was due to a clerical issue that required him to veto (and be overridden) twice on the same farm bill. He was also overridden by lawmakers in order to avoid a slash in payments to Medicare providers. Notable vetoes The first veto was issued by the first president after the first census. George Washington, a Southerner, opposed Congress' plan to reapportion congressional seats to each state by the state's population, which would have given more seats to Northern states.  He issued the veto because the Constitution said there shouldn't be more than one lawmaker per 30,000 people, and the plan approved by Congress included eight states exceeding that ratio. Thomas Jefferson, who encouraged the veto, according to the National Archives, ultimately devised a new plan to apportion seats based on the population as a whole. The first master of the veto was Grover Cleveland, who cracked down on Congress' practice of acting to individually grant pensions to people who had been rejected by the Department of Veterans Affairs.  Most presidents up to that point had issued either zero or a handful of vetoes. Cleveland, however, issued 414 vetoes during his first term. His most notable veto was to reject crop subsidies requested by Texas. Only two of his hundreds of vetoes were overridden during his first term. In total, across two terms, he issued more than 580 vetoes. Andrew Johnson, who ascended to the presidency after Abraham Lincoln's death, suffered the most veto overrides: 15. It makes sense since Johnson, a Southern Democrat, clashed with the Northern Republicans who controlled Capitol Hill at the time. The fall of the veto and the rise of obstruction The veto practice has fallen into general disuse for a number of reasons, according to Steven Smith, a political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis, who has pointed out that for starters, Congress simply doesn't send as many bills to presidents as it used to. Rather than congressional committees writing bills, since the mid-'90s, when then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich squared off with then-President Bill Clinton, congressional leaders have taken over much of the process. That means there's more coordination between the White House and Capitol Hill when the same party is in control of both. The irony of obstruction When there is a split between the White House and Congress, the president's allies in the Senate usually offer protection. ""Many of the partisan, controversial measures die in the Senate before they can be sent to the president for signature or veto,"" Smith wrote in his newsletter in 2021. Presidents have also assumed more power from Congress, giving Congress less incentive to act.  ""Every president really in the modern era, especially in the last three or four decades, has stretched the use of unilateral action,"" Smith told me on the phone, noting as an example that instead of waiting for Congress, Biden has tried to enact student loan debt relief on his own. While these actions are frequently challenged in court, they are rarely completely repealed. ""And because of the gridlock on Capitol Hill, everyone has to live with that,"" he said. Congressional obstruction seems counterproductive in this way. Less legislation has meant fewer vetoes, but also more power for presidents.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",51,0.0,0.0315,0.9410000000000001,0.0275,-0.0644,0.066,0.897,0.038,-0.9902,-3.2843999999999998,,,
DOJ ramps up its allegations that Texas is 'judge-shopping' in cases against Biden,2023-03-03,"The Justice Department is tripling down on its allegations that Texas is ""judge-shopping"" in the lawsuits the state has brought against the Biden administration.  But the department is running into headwinds as it tries to push back against the Lone Star State's pattern of filing cases in a way that allows it to effectively choose the judges that hear them.  At a hearing last week on a Justice Department request that one such case be transferred to another federal court, the judge seemed to dismiss DOJ's concerns and appeared to blame the department for creating any perception that the case assignment set up was unfair.  The judge, US District Judge Drew Tipton, is one of three judges presiding over cases where DOJ has called out Texas for funneling its litigation against the Biden administration to courthouses -- often in remote parts of the state -- where a single, pre-determined judge is assigned most or all of the cases.  With its tactics, Texas can ""circumvent the random assignment system by never filing in Divisions where they have a non-trivial chance of not knowing what judge they are likely to be assigned,"" the DOJ said in brief submitted to Tipton this week.  Private litigants have been accused of taking advantage of the system as well -- with perhaps the most high-profile example being a lawsuit by anti-abortion activists seeking to block the FDA's approval of a drug used in medication abortions, the most common method of terminating a pregnancy. The case is before Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee who has issued controversial rulings against the Biden administration in the past and who is all but guaranteed to hear cases filed in the Amarillo division, where the medication abortion lawsuit was brought.  The DOJ asked Kacsmaryk last month to transfer a separate, Texas-brought lawsuit against the administration -- a challenge to climate change-related regulations for investors -- to another district. On Monday the department filed a similar request with another Trump-appointee, Judge James Wesley Hendrix, in a case Texas filed that takes aim at the annual federal spending bill that Biden signed late last year.  Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton's office denies it's done anything improper in where it has filed cases.  ""There are numerous compelling reasons for these cases to be heard where they are filed,"" Paige Wiley, a Paxton spokesperson, told CNN in an email. She accused the Biden administration of ""perpetuating"" a ""baseless smear"" of judge-shopping that ""risks undermining the public's trust in the legal system.""  Texas and private conservative activists have had a remarkable success rate in securing court orders that block nationwide major Biden agenda items -- often in lawsuits filed in divisions where a particular judge is guaranteed to hear the case. When those judges' orders are appealed, they go to the US 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, perhaps the most conservative appeals court in the country.   Forum shopping is a strategy embraced by litigants on the left and the right. Progressives were strategic in where they brought cases against the Trump administration. But legal experts say there's a distinction between the practice then and the current trends, because with the Trump-era cases, those lawsuits were filed in courthouses where one of several Democratic-appointed judges could be assigned the case.  Tipton, however, seemed largely unconcerned with Texas' tactics of targeting its cases at his courtroom, as he grilled a DOJ attorney on whether the department was suggesting the judge would be unfair.  Tipton told the DOJ attorney, Erez Reuveni, that the department could help with the perception of fairness by saying on the public record that it believed that Tipton, as a judge, would give them a fair shake.  ""Wouldn't that go a long way to addressing any public perception issues?"" Tipton said, according to a transcript of the hearing.  A record of wins for Texas   Paxton's office has brought 28 cases against the Biden administration in Texas federal courts, according to a DOJ brief, which said that all of those lawsuits have been filed ""in just seven Divisions where local rules severely limit the number of judges to whom the cases could be assigned."" Eighteen of those cases were filed in divisions where a single, pre-determined judge is assigned all lawsuits, the DOJ has said.  Tipton presides over virtually all civil litigation filed in Victoria, Texas, including at least seven lawsuits brought by Paxton against the administration in that division. In one of those cases -- concerning the how the administration prioritizes deportations -- Tipton in 2021 halted the policy and ordered regular updates from the administration on how it was managing its deportations in accordance with his order.  That case is now being reviewed by the US Supreme Court, which has kept the Biden policy on pause. Tipton was appointed by former President Donald Trump and is viewed as a very conservative judge, having been confirmed without the support of any Democrats.  Hendrix, another Trump appointee, hears two-thirds of the civil lawsuits filed in the Lubbock division, which is located in northwest Texas and is several hours' drive from the state's biggest cities. DOJ, with its Monday request in the spending legislation case, asked the judge to move the lawsuit to DC or to Austin. The department argued that Texas' ""sole allegation related to an event in Texas is the National Board's award of a grant to a non-profit organization in Houston.""  Kacsmaryk, meanwhile, is assigned every civil case filed in Amarillo, another division in northern Texas. The judge has ruled in favor of Texas in disputes over Biden administration's LGBT protections and the president's attempts to end Trump-era migration restrictions. He is now in the national spotlight for his forthcoming ruling in the medication abortion case, which could be issued any day now.  The lead plaintiff in that case, a medical organization called the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, filed its paperwork incorporating in Amarillo just a few months before filing the lawsuit. However, the organization's attorney pushed back on allegations that the filing location was chosen strategically to get the case before Kacsmaryk.  ""It's an utterly nonsensical argument to make because we have every right to file a lawsuit where our clients are injured,"" Erik Baptist -- a senior counsel at Alliance Defending Freedom, which is representing the abortion pill challengers -- told CNN. He pointed to an individual plaintiff in the lawsuit, Dr. Shaun Jester, who practices near Amarillo.  ""Congress has authorized the American public to sue federal agencies where the American public has actually been injured and where they reside,"" Baptist said. ""And that's exactly what Dr. Jester did here. He filed this lawsuit with the other plaintiffs in this case because he is based in the Amarillo area, and therefore, we filed this lawsuit where he resides.""    Texas defends its tactics  To explain why its lawsuits against the Biden administration often end up in single-judge divisions miles from the state capital, Texas is leaning on case law that says that states -- when suing the federal government -- reside in all parts of their borders and are not restricted to filing suits in the court divisions containing their state capitals.  Leif Olson, an attorney in Paxton's office, told Tipton at last week's hearing that ""I don't know why our office chooses to file in seven divisions over and over,"" referring to the seven divisions DOJ highlighted in its briefs.  Olson told Tipton that the specific immigration case was filed in Victoria because Paxton's office felt like it knew how the judge ran his court room and because Tipton was familiar with the statutes relevant to the case.  ""The long and short of it, Your Honor, is that the public interest is served by having the case decided fairly and quickly. That is available in the Victoria Division,"" Olson said.  Reuveni, the DOJ attorney, meanwhile, stressed that their motion wasn't targeted at Tipton, whom the department thought was a fair judge, but rather it was aimed at Texas' tactics. Reuveni said that the department would have no issue if the case was randomly assigned to Tipton, having been transferred to a court division where Tipton shares case assignment with other judges. Tipton, however, suggested DOJ was to blame for exacerbating any public perception of unfairness, and the judge highlighted his tendency of granting DOJ requests for pauses of his orders so they can be appealed.  When pressed by the judge, Reuveni confirmed that the department believed that Tipton was impartial.  ""Don't you think if the public heard the Department of Justice say that, that it would go a long way towards addressing your public perception concern?"" the judge said.  The judge is expected to rule on the motion to transfer in the next few weeks.

Michigan threats deepen America's dangerous nexus between antisemitism and political violence,2023-03-03,"An alleged threat to kill Jewish government leaders in Michigan reflects two of the most dangerous, and interlocking, menaces in American politics and society -- an alarming spike in antisemitism and escalating threats against elected officials. Police last month arrested a man accused of posting a Twitter threat to ""carry out the punishment of death"" against anyone Jewish in the Wolverine State's government. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said on Thursday she was among those targeted. This is the latest example of a growing trend of intimidation and attacks targeting Jewish people at a time when extremists, who might once have been isolated, find affirmation and spurs to act from social media. Only a few years ago, top American officials would bemoan rising antisemitism in Europe and question whether the lessons of the Holocaust were being forgotten: Now it's a growing and pernicious feature of US life that threatens the security and peace of mind of millions of citizens whom extremists want to ostracize as outsiders in their own country.  In certain political and social media circles -- sometimes fueled by celebrities -- antisemitic rhetoric that was once taboo seems to be filtering into accepted discourse, alongside conspiracy theories like QAnon. It is hardly a coincidence that assaults, vandalism and harassment targeting Jewish communities and individuals in the United States have raced to their highest levels on record.  And the consequences run much deeper than this inhumanity. History shows that antisemitism, which is attractive to unhinged conspiracy theorists, is often an early warning sign or a symptom of deepening threats to democracy. The latest spate of incidents targeting Jewish Americans coincides with unprecedented attacks on the integrity of elections and the public officials who administer them. It comes as right-wing commentators muse about ""Great Replacement Theory,"" which posits that outsiders are coming to America to overwhelm its majority White population -- a fantasy that has its roots in antisemitism but is now often applied to migrants. ""Unfortunately, whether it is in Michigan or other parts of the country, we are seeing the confluence of anti-government, Covid and other conspiracy theories combined with antisemitism, and we see how this is animating people to action,"" Oren Segal, vice president of the Center on Extremism at the Anti-Defamation League, said on CNN Thursday. ""It is not only operating in spaces online but in the fantasies and imaginations of people who are willing to then take action."" Violence as a political tool  This is an age when political brutality isn't just some remote theoretical possibility. Ex-President Donald Trump's lies and incitement spilled over after the 2020 presidential election, when the US Capitol insurrection chillingly revealed that some Americans view violence as a legitimate tool to express their political grievances. The unrelenting lies about a stolen election, the currency that election deniers have on the right and the endless propaganda on conservative television curate a festering pool of anger that influences those who are tempted to act on their own anti-democratic grievances. The alleged threats against specifically Jewish officials in Michigan are only the most recent and high-profile example of a rising tide of antisemitism. Last month, San Francisco police arrested a man who allegedly made political statements and fired apparently blank rounds in a synagogue. Days earlier, a man allegedly threw a Molotov cocktail at a synagogue in New Jersey. In December, a 63-year-old man was assaulted in New York's Central Park in what police called an antisemitic attack. These were just the latest is a string of antisemitic incidents that included incendiary tweets from Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, with whom Trump dined at Mar-a-Lago in November, alongside White supremacist Nick Fuentes. Also last year, demonstrators were spotted giving the Nazi salute and holding banners targeting Jews on a Los Angeles bridge. Shocking antisemitic messages were also projected onto buildings in Jacksonville, Florida. In 2018, a mass shooting at the Pittsburgh Tree of Life synagogue that killed 11 people stunned the nation. The year before, White supremacists converged on Charlottesville, Virginia, chanting, ""Jews will not replace us,"" in a march over which then-President Donald Trump equivocated. Scores more incidents failed to make national headlines but have had a corrosive and frightening impact on America's Jewish community. The Anti-Defamation League, in the latest available annual figures, found that a total of 2,717 antisemitic incidents were reported in 2021 -- a 34% increase on the 2,026 incidents reported the year before. In the new case in Michigan, the FBI National Threat Operations Center told the Detroit FBI office that a person with the Twitter handle ""tempered_reason"" said he was heading to Michigan and ""threatening to carry out the punishment of death to anyone that is Jewish in the Michigan govt."" Any attempt to ""subdue"" him would ""be met with deadly force in self-defense,"" the user said.  Former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe said Thursday that the details of the alleged threats to Nessel and other officials underscored the increasing risks of political attacks motivated by antisemitism and extremism. ""This is right in the wheelhouse of what the FBI and Director [Chris] Wray have told us. That ... the most dangerous, the most concerning threat that they face on the counterterrorist side, and that is the threat from domestic violent extremists,"" McCabe said on ""CNN Newsroom."" He added that such offenders were often ""motivated by racial animus, they're motivated by antisemitic feelings, by anti-immigrant feelings, charged sometimes with political grievance and then motivated to act violently on their own.""  The dangers to democracy posed by political intimidation  Even without the antisemitic dimension, the alleged threats to Nessel and other officials are a fresh example of Michigan's problem with political hate and extremism, though the state is far from alone in seeing its officials exposed to intimidation. In December, a federal judge sentenced one of the convicted leaders of a separate plot to kidnap Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to nearly 20 years in prison. The man's lawyers argued he had descended down a ""conspiracy rabbit hole"" during long solo trips as a truck driver. Another Democratic state official involved in election administration, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, has said armed protesters turned up outside her home to denounce her as a ""traitor"" in late 2020 when Trump was pushing lies about a stolen election in the critical swing state. Outside Michigan, two Georgia election officials testified last year to the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection how verbal attacks on them by Trump and his aides had ruined their lives, with one saying, ""There is nowhere I feel safe."" In January, a Republican former candidate for New Mexico's legislature -- who claimed there had been election fraud, according to police -- was arrested on suspicion of orchestrating shootings that damaged the homes of Democratic elected leaders. And Paul Pelosi, the husband of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, is still recovering from a late October assault, allegedly by a man with a hammer who told police that Democrats had committed crimes against Trump, using rhetoric popular with the ex-president's supporters.  Democrats are not the only victims of extremism. In 2017, Republican Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, who now serves as House majority leader, was seriously injured in a shooting at a congressional baseball practice by a man claiming to be a Bernie Sanders supporter. And last year, police arrested a man near Brett Kavanaugh's home and charged him with attempting to murder the conservative Supreme Court justice.  And as recently as Thursday, New Hampshire woman Katelyn Jones, 25, pleaded guilty to sending a series of threatening texts to a Michigan county election official after the 2020 election. She faces up to 10 years in prison when she is sentenced in July, according to the Justice Department.  Each case is different, and individuals act on their own agency however they might be persuaded by heated political rhetoric. Politicians often use this to claim plausible deniability that their words caused violence. But the House January 6 committee aired video of Trump supporters on the day of the riot saying they were inspired by his false claims of election fraud. And a poll from The Washington Post and the University of Maryland in January 2022 found that 34% of Americans -- and 41% of Republicans -- think violent action against the government is sometimes justified. It is also undeniable that antisemitic attacks and violence and threats against public officials are coming at a time when the ex-president and his supporters have made false claims about stolen elections, which have been amplified by powerful media organizations like Fox News, even when -- as emerged in court filings this week -- the network's leaders knew those claims to be lies.  Just this week, Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who also has a record of spreading antisemitic material, showed up at a meeting on election integrity and berated Gabriel Sterling, a Republican election official from the Peach State who resisted Trump's baseless claims that he won the swing state in 2020. Greene fired off a flurry of claims and conspiracies for the cameras, which were almost all false. ""She came in late. She purposely sat next to me because she wanted to get her social media hits,"" Sterling told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Wednesday. Behavior like that often seen from Greene and Trump risks damaging democracy at its roots, since it comes with sometimes dangerous consequences for local public officials like Michigan's Nessel, who are critical to ensuring Americans can vote.   ""It's happening in almost every state. It's happening against regular people,"" said Rachel Kleinfeld, a senior fellow in the Democracy, Conflict and Governance Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""Who is willing to take these jobs?"" she asked, before warning: ""Our democracy is only as good as the people we elect, and we can only elect the people willing to run. And polling is showing that people are stepping back from running when they have to add this to a stressful job that doesn't pay particularly well and puts them in the literal targets of their fellow citizens.""","{'neg': 0.556, 'neu': 0.444, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.875}",60,2.0,0.14422222222222222,0.7845555555555556,0.07122222222222223,-0.3053111111111111,0.199,0.737,0.064,-0.9998,-18.318666666666665,,,
Fair and Balanced? Murdoch's private messages show Fox News was instructed to help Republicans,2023-03-03,"""We report. You decide."" That was the longtime slogan of Fox News. But a deposition and private messages made public in recent weeks has exposed that even Rupert Murdoch doesn't treat Fox News like an actual news organization. The revelation is part of several legal filings from Dominion Voting Systems' $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against the right-wing talk channel, uncovering numerous instances in which the Fox Corporation chairman brazenly directed the network's leadership to help the Republican Party. A version of this article first appeared in the ""Reliable Sources"" newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. Taken as a whole, the statements show that Murdoch apparently views Fox News more like an extension of the GOP than a credible news organization with a mission of informing viewers and allowing them to arrive at their own decisions.  The legal filings are littered with examples of Murdoch tipping the scales: ► Murdoch gave Jared Kushner ""confidential information"" about then-candidate Joe Biden's ads ""along with debate strategy"" in 2020, a filing said, offering Donald Trump's son-in-law ""a preview of Biden's ads before they were public."" ► Murdoch asked Fox News chief executive Suzanne Scott to have Sean Hannity say ""something supportive"" about Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham ahead of the 2020 election. Murdoch explained, ""We cannot lose the Senate if at all possible."" ► Following Trump's loss, Murdoch told Scott to ""concentrate on Georgia"" when the state was holding a high-stakes special election that would decide the balance of power in the US Senate, instructing her to be ""helping any way we can."" ► When Trump appealed for help defeating Republican West Virginia Senate candidate Don Blankenship, Murdoch told Scott and Fox News president Jay Wallace, ""Anything during day helpful but Sean [Hannity] and Laura [Ingraham] dumping on him hard might save the day."" ► When then-New York Post editor Col Allan told Murdoch that Biden's only hope for winning the election was ""to stay in his basement and not face serious questions,"" Murdoch responded, ""Just made sure Fox banging on about these issues. If the audience talks the theme will spread."" Taken in isolation, any one of these actions would be considered a major scandal at an actual news organization. There would be investigations and likely disciplinary measures would ensue. But at Fox News, that's not the case. That's almost certainly because the leadership does not view the channel in the same way that it is marketed to viewers and advertisers. And Murdoch isn't the only person in leadership who seemingly doesn't view Fox News as a straight-shooting news organization (which, to be clear, it most definitely is not). In the Dominion filings, former House Speaker turned Fox Corporation board member Paul Ryan wrote the Murdochs, ""[T]he sooner we can put down the echoes of falsehoods from our side, the faster we can get onto principled loyal opposition."" Notice the words Ryan used there: ""Loyal opposition."" That's what Ryan thinks Fox News should apparently be, in its best form.  Critics have long accused Fox News of being the ""opposition"" to Democratic officeholders and candidates. Honest observers have known for quite some time that that is the case. It's just striking to hear Fox leadership like Ryan talk openly behind the scenes about what the company is at its core. Fox News has accused Dominion of having ""cherry picked"" statements to unfairly malign the network. But it's hard to see how, under any circumstances, these instructions to a supposed network news chief would be appropriate.

Jim Jordan's first FBI whistleblowers face scrutiny from skeptical Democrats,2023-03-03,"In his quest to prove the federal government has been ""weaponized"" against conservatives, Republican House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan has touted the allegations of what he claims are ""dozens"" of whistleblowers who have come to his office with stories of discrimination and bias.  While little is known about them, Jordan's reliance on these whistleblowers is already emerging as an early flashpoint, with Democrats raising questions about their legitimacy as actual whistleblowers and the relevance of their testimony.  Three of Jordan's witnesses have come in for private interviews with committee staff so far. None of them appear to have had their claims validated by government entities that grant federal whistleblower protection, sources familiar with their testimony said. One who alleged there was FBI wrongdoing had their claims rejected. Another is retired and it's unclear whether he has first-hand knowledge of the violations he alleges. The third has not revealed his direct disclosures or FBI suspension notice to House Democrats, according to transcripts reviewed by CNN.  Separately, several other supposed whistleblowers who have not come in for interviews were suspended from the FBI for being at the Capitol on January 6, 2021, according to multiple sources familiar with the committee's work. This is a point Jordan has not shied away from, using the accounts of ""several whistleblowers"" in a May 2022 letter to accuse the FBI of ""retaliating against employees"" for engaging in ""protected First Amendment activity on January 6."" Jordan added in the letter that he had been told none of these whistleblowers were inside the US Capitol, charged with any crime or contacted by law enforcement about their actions. For more than a year, Jordan has made whistleblower allegations a central part of his campaign to uncover what he claims is political bias inside the federal government, including drafting a 1,000-page report last year that leans heavily on claims by government employees alleging political interference by both the Justice Department and the FBI.  That report and the groundswell of support among House Republicans helped lead to the creation of an entire subcommittee Jordan now leads, the ""Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government,"" which is helming the whistleblower interviews.  Democrats on Jordan's weaponization subcommittee, already skeptical of its premise, are frustrated that many of the materials regarding these individuals have not been shared. While Democratic members and their staff have interviewed some of these people behind closed doors alongside their GOP counterparts, what they have learned so far has not been encouraging, Democrats told CNN.     ""Who knows whether he has dozens. Who are these people? Why haven't we been given a list? What kind of credibility do they have?"" Democratic Rep. Gerry Connolly, who serves on the subcommittee, told CNN.  GOP Rep. Kelly Armstrong, who serves on Jordan's weaponization subcommittee, accused Democrats of discrediting the whistleblowers before having a chance to hear them out.   ""Discounting whistleblowers before the Democrats know what the witnesses have to offer says a lot more about their agenda than it does about the validity of the whistleblowers,"" Armstrong told CNN.  ""Procedural mistakes should splatter like paint. It's messy but the results should be random. In my four years here every mistake DOJ has made has benefited one side and harmed the other. That's a hell of a coincidence,"" Armstrong told CNN. A senior GOP staffer told CNN that Jordan plans to share whistleblower information only if the individual agrees to go on the record. ""If they're willing to go on the record, if they're willing to sit for transcribed interviews, that's the point where we provide their name and attorney to our Democrats. And that's pretty standard,"" the senior GOP staffer said.  Russell Dye, a spokesperson for Jordan, said in a statement to CNN, ""It is beyond disappointing, but sadly not surprising, that Democrats would leak cherry-picked excerpts of testimony to attack the brave whistleblowers who risked their careers to speak out on abuses at the Justice Department and FBI.""  'An elephant gun to kill a mouse': A suspended FBI agent's concerns with a SWAT arrest Some of Jordan's whistleblowers who have been suspended from the FBI have formed a ""little bit of a network,"" the senior Republican aide told CNN. One whistleblower told CNN that some of them communicate over a group text chain and that many initially connected through a community of unvaccinated employees.   Right-wing opinions about the January 6 attack appear to be a consistent throughline among the three individuals that have come forward so far.   One of them is Steve Friend, a former FBI agent working out of Florida who was suspended in August 2022 for objecting to using a SWAT team to arrest a subject for what Friend described as ""misdemeanor offenses.""  Friend, who was interviewed by Republican and Democratic subcommittee staff earlier this month, was not part of the SWAT team but was asked to help with the case and refused, he told CNN in an interview.   The men arrested on the date Friend listed in his disclosures were members of a Florida-based organization known as the ""Guardians of Freedom,"" which adheres to the ideology of the ""Three Percenters"" and were illegally at the Capitol on January 6, according to the FBI.   The one individual charged with a misdemeanor of that group from Florida was at the Capitol on January 6 wearing a black gas mask, a tactical vest and a military-type helmet and goggles, according to court documents reviewed by CNN. One witness interviewed for the case claimed that the defendant had an AR-style rifle with him as well.   Following his subcommittee interview, Friend told CNN he was suspended, in part, for raising concerns that the FBI was using ""unnecessary force.""   ""I compared it to using an elephant gun to kill a mouse,"" Friend, who officially resigned from the FBI on the day of his interview with committee staff, told CNN.  Friend also told CNN that his concern with using a SWAT team would contribute to the illusion that ""half the country are potentially domestic terrorists"" and therefore prevent people from participating ""in a political dialogue.""   Friend admitted in the subcommittee interview that owning a gun or being accused of a felony crime were reasons for FBI management to consider using a SWAT team, according to transcripts reviewed by CNN. After Friend was suspended for refusing to help in the case, he filed a whistleblower complaint to the Justice Department inspector general on September 21, 2022. He also filed a claim with the US Office of Special Counsel, the function of which is to protect federal employees making whistleblower complaints.  Friend's claim was eventually rejected by both entities.   ""We cannot find with a substantial likelihood that the agency has violated a law, rule, or regulation or has abused its authority. Therefore, we will take no further action on this matter,"" the November 10, 2022, OSC report read, according to a copy reviewed by CNN.  On December 2, 2022, the DOJ inspector general declined to open an investigation into the claims Friend raised. Friend is still waiting for the OIG to render a decision about his claims that the FBI retaliated against him.  US law creates specific requirements for those who say they have been retaliated against for their claims. An individual must make a disclosure to the special counsel, to an inspector general or to Congress that provides evidence of any violation of ""any rule, law or regulation"" or ""gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety.""    Friend is now a senior fellow at the Center for Renewing America, a policy shop run by former Trump administration officials.   ""Steve Friend bravely blew the whistle on FBI overreach and is devoted to ending the abuses of federal law enforcement,"" Rachel Semmel, a spokesperson for the group, told CNN. ""We are proud to have him working with us at Center for Renewing America.""  FBI spokesperson Christina Pullen told CNN, ""Employees who don't carry out their responsibilities are held accountable through an objective administrative process. The FBI is required to follow established policies and procedures, to include a thorough investigation, when suspending or revoking a security clearance. FBI employees who report evidence of wrongdoing through a protected disclosure are protected from retaliation.""  'Insurrection my a$$': A retired FBI agent's allegations  Judiciary committee staff have also interviewed a former FBI analyst who retired in October 2021 named George Hill, who supervised intelligence analysts that provided support to less than a dozen cases related to January 6.  In his interview with the subcommittee Hill criticized a bank that he says shared with the FBI records of people who were in DC on January 6, according to transcripts reviewed by CNN.  When pressed, Hill said he simply saw a record listed in Sentinel, the FBI's case management system, and that he did not open it, according to the transcript. As part of its investigation into the January 6 attack at the Capitol, the FBI collected financial, communications and other business records of people investigated for possible crimes related to the Capitol riot. It's a routine investigative tool used to help investigators and prosecutors gather evidence. Bank transactions could be used to show travel and location of suspected rioters, and could be used to establish the purchase of weapons used in the attacks on police protecting the Capitol.  Hill also raised concerns about a request that he says the Washington, DC, FBI field office made to the Boston field office to open preliminary investigations into two buses of people that traveled into DC on January 6. In his interview with the committee, Hill said he was told about the request, sources familiar with his testimony told CNN. Hill said there were concerns about violating people's First Amendment protected activity, the transcript read. Pullen said in a statement to CNN, ""the FBI's policy is to neither confirm nor deny the existence of investigations, however, the FBI will never open an investigation based solely on First Amendment protected activity,"" when asked about the claim of an investigation being opened into those buses. Hill has previously raised some of his claims on a podcast and in an interview with ""Just the News."" Hill's interview covered tweets he made concerning the January 6 attack, a number of which have since been deleted, according to the transcript reviewed by CNN.  On December 28, 2022, for example, Hill tweeted, ""insurrection my a$$. It was a set up and sadly, there's no shortage of idiots willing to take","{'neg': 0.204, 'neu': 0.796, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.3182}",67,4.0,0.0,0.849,0.151,0.4939,0.13,0.786,0.084,-0.9982,33.091300000000004,12.099673333333339,258.0,0.04689795865633077
Opinion: How a third party could unintentionally lead to a Trump 2024 victory,2023-03-02,"As he was planning his 2000 third-party bid for the presidency, Ralph Nader asked me to meet with him. Nader strongly believed that he could launch a viable Green Party, seizing at least 5% of the national vote, which would qualify the Greens for federal matching funds, and begin to erode what he called ""the two-party duopoly.""   ""I'm not sure if you can do that,"" I told Nader. ""But I am sure of this: If you succeed, you'll elect George W. Bush."" Nader vehemently disagreed. He thought that then-Vice President Al Gore would still have enough votes to win comfortably, and he wanted to pull him to the left. I failed to dissuade Nader, obviously. The rest, as they say, is history. Bush was credited with a win in Florida by just 537 votes. Nader received 97,488 votes in Florida. Some might say that third-party presidential candidates are like cockroaches in the kitchen. To quote legendary Texas Longhorn football coach Darrell Royal, ""It's not what they eat and tote off, it's what they fall into and mess up that hurts."" The good folks of the political organization No Labels are diving into the presidential election of 2024. The organization describes itself as a group that ""demands American leaders and citizens alike declare their freedom from the anger and divisiveness that are ruining our politics and, most importantly, our country."" And yet their central project -- organizing a moderate third-party candidacy for president in 2024 -- would, despite their stated intentions, likely reward the most extreme, most divisive, most angry forces in our politics. In a video on their website, chief strategist Ryan Clancy explains his group is working to get a spot on the ballot in all 50 states, ""to create an opening for a presidential ticket that stands for the kind of ideas that appeal to most people, even if it drives the extremes crazy."" What ideas? Well, Clancy says in the video, they're coming. ""Soon.""   No Labels, thus far, has offered no concrete ideas or policies. Nothing about whether corporations should pay more in taxes, as Democrats want, or less, as Republicans do. Nothing about whether health care should be more driven by private markets, as Republicans favor, or more heavily subsidized by the government, as Democrats do.  All we know is that No Labels rejects partisanship and division and extremism. Here's the simple political reality, as I see it: In recent elections, most voters who reject extremism have tended to vote Democratic. This means the vast majority of votes that a No Labels presidential candidate would receive would likely come out of President Joe Biden's pool of potential voters, not former President Donald Trump's -- assuming the 2024 election turns out to be a 2020 rematch.     Third Way, another centrist public policy group, has a more compelling answer. According to their analysis, a third-party candidate ""would act as a spoiler,"" and that the kind of post-partisan candidacy No Labels calls for would pull disproportionately from the Democratic nominee. Simply put, there is no way in the world a third-party candidate can win. But a moderate third-party candidate would, in my estimation, almost certainly elect Mr. Trump. Ross Perot, the most successful independent candidate in modern times, who spent millions of his money on campaigning, won nearly one out of every five votes in 1992 -- and earned precisely zero electoral votes. What made Perot different from the No Labels effort is he drew from both parties. His pro-change, pro-choice, anti-Gulf War, anti-NAFTA positions drew from Democratic candidate Bill Clinton's voter base, and his pro-business, anti-deficit positions drew from Republican President George H.W. Bush's base. The strongest third-party candidate ever was former Republican President Theodore Roosevelt, who got 88 electoral votes -- not near enough to win, but more than enough to swing the 1912 election away from his former GOP protégé  William Howard Taft and give the presidency to Democrat Woodrow Wilson. The best performance by an independent since Roosevelt was Democrat-turned-independent George Wallace, who in 1968 won five states. In the half-century since, not a single independent presidential candidate has won a single electoral vote.   Democrats may not want to hear this, but Third Way does not flinch from the facts: Trump got more votes in 2020 than in 2016. After two impeachments, after banning people from Muslim-majority countries, after siding with Putin over US intelligence agencies in Helsinki, after initially saying Covid-19 would ""disappear.""    After all that, he got more raw votes and a higher percentage of the vote in the key swing states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. But whereas Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton lost those states in 2016, Biden won them. Why? As Third Way states, ""In 2016, there was a third slice eating into Clinton's support. In 2020, that third party segment shrank, so Biden's support eclipsed Trump's."" In 2016, two third parties -- the Libertarian and the Green parties -- both competed heavily across the country, drawing almost 6 million votes between the two of them. In 2020, voters pulled back from third parties, and they drew closer to 2 million votes. Though that was not the only reason for Biden's success, as Third Way points out, ""Biden won 2016 third-party voters by a 30-point margin."" Of course, there was not a wholesale rejection of Trump's brand of extremism in 2020, nor is there likely to be in 2024. But a sensible, centrist, moderate, anti-partisan candidate, as No Labels is seeking, will succeed in electing Trump, the most divisive, polarizing politician of modern times.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.787, 'pos': 0.213, 'compound': 0.4019}",46,5.0,0.0252,0.8267999999999999,0.1482,0.38693999999999995,0.066,0.779,0.155,0.9986,17.799239999999998,33.18331333333334,253.0,0.1311593412384717
Justice Department pushes back on Trump's sweeping claims of presidential immunity for January 6 speech,2023-03-02,"The Justice Department on Thursday urged an appeals court to reject sweeping claims of presidential immunity put forward by former President Donald Trump in the civil litigation surrounding the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol. The department told the appeals court -- which is considering several private lawsuits brought against Trump for his conduct in the lead-up to the attack on the Capitol -- that a president can't be absolutely immune for speech on a matter of public concern if the speech is found to have incited violence. ""No part of a president's official responsibilities includes the incitement of imminent private violence,"" the Justice Department said in a friend-of-a-court brief that the US DC Circuit Court of Appeals asked the government to file. Thursday's brief marks the first time the department has confronted directly the question of Trump's civil immunity for his conduct related to January 6. The lawsuits were brought by Democratic members of the House and Capitol Police officers. A 1982 ruling from the US Supreme Court established that presidents are absolutely immune from civil damages arising from their official acts as president -- but when presidential speech amounts to an official act is still a murky question for the courts. The new filing stressed how difficult the legal disputes around the presidential immunity are, with the Justice Department telling the DC Circuit that in ""all contexts, questions of presidential immunity must be approached with the greatest sensitivity to the unremitting demands of the Presidency."" The Justice Department did caution the court against using the January 6 civil cases as a vehicle to draw firm lines on whether president can face liability for speech related to electoral or political concerns. Instead, the department asked the DC Circuit to issue a ""narrow"" ruling, focused solely on the assertion by Trump's attorneys that he should be immune to civil lawsuits for presidential speech even if that speech incited violence. The January 6 civil cases are currently at a phase where courts are weighing questions about the legal strength of the claims against Trump, and those courts are not yet considering the factual merits of the allegations against the former president. A district court judge previously denied a Trump motion to dismiss the case, finding that the former president was not absolutely immune from the civil January 6 lawsuit. The DC Circuit is now considering a Trump request to reverse that ruling. After hearing arguments on the matter last year, the appeals court invited the Justice Department to weigh in. ""The United States here expresses no view on the district court's conclusion that plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that President Trump's January 6 speech incited the subsequent attack on the Capitol,"" the DOJ said in its brief. ""But because actual incitement would be unprotected by absolute immunity even if it came in the context of a speech on matters of public concern, this Court should reject the categorical argument President Trump pressed below and renews on appeal."" In response to the filing, a Trump spokesperson said, ""The D.C. Courts should rule in favor of President Trump in short order and dismiss these frivolous lawsuits.""  Whether Trump can face certain civil lawsuits for his conduct while in the White House has been tricky ground for the Justice Department to navigate. The Justice Department, under Attorney General Merrick Garland, came under fire from the left when it held onto the department's Trump-era position that Trump could not be sued personally for allegedly defaming a woman who accused him of sexual assault. The courts are still considering the question, but if it sides with DOJ, that would force the dismissal of the case, brought by E. Jean Carroll. In the January 6 civil cases, the department is seeking to take a very precise stance for why Trump could potentially be held liable in the civil lawsuits for his January 6-related conduct. It is asking the DC Circuit to not issue any ruling that would attempt ""to comprehensively define the boundaries of the president's immunity for his speech on matters of public concern -- including when and how to draw a line between the president's official and electoral speech."" The Justice Department emphasized it was not weighing in on any potential criminal liability. In the brief, the department said in a footnote that it ""does not express any view regarding the potential criminal liability of any person for the events of January 6, 2021, or acts connected with those events."" A special counsel is leading a federal criminal investigation into efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election.

Five times Chris Rock said the thing out loud,2023-03-02,"From his early days on ""Saturday Night Live"" to his first standup special ""Bring the Pain"" and next a history-making live event on Netflix, Chris Rock's comedy has been shaping popular culture for more than three decades. On Saturday, Rock's latest special, ""Selective Outrage,"" will mark the first global live event to stream on Netflix.  A teaser trailer for the special shows Rock sitting in a dressing room when he gets a knock at the door, announcing, ""Chris, they're ready for you."" In anticipation for the main event, here are five times Rock was at his funniest. 'Bigger & Blacker' (1999) Rock tackles several big topics like racism and gun control in this special, released not long after the Columbine massacre.  He talked about firearms and ammunition being too accessible and suggested a solution.  ""If a bullet cost $5,000, there'd be no more innocent bystanders,"" Rock said. Election night sketch on 'Saturday Night Live' (2016) Rock appeared as a castmember on ""SNL"" from 1990 to 1993 and has hosted the show three times since. In 2016, just after Donald Trump was elected US president, Rock made a surprise appearance in a sketch alongside the night's host, Dave Chappelle.  The two attended an election night party in the skit, where a group of White guests made comments about how shocked they were at the results of the presidential election.  Rock and Chappelle are shocked the guests had been so ignorant.  'Late Show with David Letterman' appearance (2010) Rock appeared on the talk show many times, but a 2010 appearance stands out. At the time, Letterman was recovering from a public scandal after admitting he had been in intimate relationships with some female staffers. The host was under the weather and losing his voice, so Rock asked him why he hadn't taken a few days off.  ""Wife still mad at ya, ain't she?"" Rock joked. ""Why drive back to Connecticut to a mean woman? 'I may as well just stay here and do the show with no voice.' I love ya honey. I been there, Dave. I do get sick on the road. And if my wife is mad at me I add a few shows."" He admits to his own faults (2018) In his special ""Tamborine,"" Rock got real about his divorce from Malaak Compton-Rock, admitting in his set, ""I was not a good husband."" He went on to explain why. ""When you're in a relationship, you're in a band,"" Rock said. ""And when you're in a band, you have roles that you play in the band. Sometimes you sing lead and sometimes you're on tambourine. And if you're on tambourine, play it right ... 'cause nobody wants to see a mad tambourine player."" O.J. Simpson (1996) Rock's 1996 special ""Bring the Pain"" shot him to fame.  He talked about the O.J. Simpson trial.  ""Black people too happy, White people too mad,"" Rock said of Simpson's acquittal. ""I haven't seen White people that mad since they canceled ""M*A*S*H.""   ""That s--- was about fame. If O.J. wasn't famous, he'd be in jail right now,"" Rock said.

"DeSantis says GOP will not 'mess with Social Security,' as Democrats and Trump slam his past support for privatization",2023-03-02,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Thursday distanced himself from his past support for privatizing Social Security and raising the retirement age as potential future political foes seize on his previous ideas for the popular retirement program. ""We're not going to mess with Social Security as Republicans,"" DeSantis told Fox News. ""I think that that's pretty clear."" As a congressman, DeSantis voted for nonbinding budget resolutions that would have made age 70 the new threshold for seniors to collect their federal benefits. A recent CNN KFile review review of DeSantis' comments during his 2012 congressional campaign found support for privatizing Social Security as well. The attempt by DeSantis to publicly walk back a position foundational to the fiscal conservatism that defined his early political career comes as former President Donald Trump has made support for Medicare and Social Security an early fault line in the 2024 GOP presidential primary. Trump has singled out DeSantis, who is traveling the country to promote his new book and raise his profile ahead of a highly anticipated campaign for president.  Unloading on his social media platform, Trump this week called DeSantis ""the man who wants to cut Social Security and Medicare"" and a ""wheelchair over the cliff kind of guy, just like his hero, failed politician Paul Ryan."" The criticism revived an attack line Democrats used over a decade ago to undercut Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican who proposed partial privatization of Medicare and Social Security in his budget blueprints and was named Mitt Romney's running mate in 2012. In an ad that aired in multiple swing states, an actor seemingly portraying Ryan wheeled an elderly woman to the edge of a cliff and pushed her over. DeSantis has largely avoided engaging with Trump and didn't previously respond to questions about his past positions. His new book, ""The Courage to Be Free,"" glosses over his early political career and his nearly three terms in Congress, instead focusing largely on the cultural fights that have defined his first term as governor and fueled his ascent in the GOP.  But Thursday, in his latest of several appearances promoting his book, DeSantis was asked by Fox News host Dana Perino about a proposal to raise the retirement age for federal benefits to 70. He pivoted to criticizing President Joe Biden's past votes on Social Security before appearing to dismiss concerns about the long-term financial outlook of federal entitlement programs. ""There's a lot of the budget people used to say, they would blame Social Security or Medicare for budget woes. But the reality is they have printed trillions and trillions of dollars, and that has really fueled the inflation,"" the governor said. The statement appears at odds with what DeSantis said in 2012, when he first ran for Congress as a tea party conservative and a disciple of Ryan's and his hawkish budgets. DeSantis said at the time that it was ""unsustainable"" to allow seniors to retire before their late 60s, CNN KFile found. He also voiced support for Ryan's plans for privatizing Social Security. ""What I think we need to do for people in my generation, particularly, is start to restructure the program in a way that's going to be financially sustainable, both Social Security and Medicare,"" he said at the time. DeSantis' about-face drew immediate rebuke Thursday from the Democratic National Committee, which accused the Republican governor in a press release of attempting to ""completely rewrite his long, established record of supporting cuts to Social Security and Medicare."" On social media, the party posted side-by-side video featuring DeSantis' past comments and his remarks Thursday.   As Trump pressures Republicans to support Medicare and Social Security, other potential 2024 contenders have voiced support for making changes to the programs. Former Vice President Mike Pence told CNBC last month that Social Security and Medicare needs to be ""on the table"" in dealing with US national debt. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley declared early in her campaign for president that ""we do have to address entitlements"" for future beneficiaries. DeSantis' pivot marks the second time he has appeared to change his position to more closely align with Trump's. The governor recently voiced opposition to American intervention in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, after repeatedly voicing support in the past for sending ""defensive and offensive"" weapons to Ukraine to deter Russian aggression.  While Trump has tried to pull his potential primary opponents into uncomfortable policy fights in recent weeks, DeSantis has sought to steer the narrative around his likely candidacy to his legislative wins as governor. He launched his new book a day after signing a bill that effectively gives him control of Disney's special taxing district in Florida, a saga that is recounted in detail in his political memoir. In his appearance on Fox News, DeSantis teased a potential announcement after the upcoming legislative session, which starts next week, when the governor is expected to push through more of his ideological agenda.  ""When we get on the other side of that, assuming we've been successful,"" DeSantis said, ""we'll take a look at what that would mean for national.""

White House releases ambitious cyber strategy calling for more regulation of vulnerable sectors,2023-03-02,"The White House on Thursday released an ambitious national cybersecurity strategy that calls for new federal regulation of vulnerable critical infrastructure firms and for software makers to be held liable when their products leave gaping holes for hackers to exploit. The strategy -- shaped by major hacking incidents that threatened key public services in the first year of the Biden administration -- embraces the US government's regulatory and purchasing power to force companies that are critical to economic and national security to raise their cyber defenses. It reflects a widely held belief in the US government that market forces have failed to keep the nation safe from cybercriminals and an array of foreign governments such as Russia and China.  ""We have to drive the entire ecosystem to be more cyber vigilant,"" Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in an interview with CNN on Thursday. The Biden administration will look for new regulatory authorities if necessary ""to make sure that we are shoring up our critical infrastructure"" in the face of advanced hacking threats ""because the adversaries are not decreasing in activity, only increasing."" Acting National Cyber Director Kemba Walden said that too often small businesses and local governments bear the brunt of cyberattacks. ""This isn't just unfair, it's ineffective,"" said Walden, a White House official, told reporters on Wednesday. The strategy is a policy document and not law, but it could shape corporate behavior for years to come as firms compete for billions of dollars in federal contracts that increasingly require a minimum set of cybersecurity defenses. And the White House says it wants to work with Congress to develop legislation that holds software makers liable when their products and services don't provide adequate protections from sabotage.  The goal of US government and corporate work on cybersecurity should be to ""correct market failures, minimize the harms from cyber incidents to society's most vulnerable,"" a copy of the strategy states.  The strategy does not specify which sectors of the economy the administration could regulate next, but US officials have previously signaled that one area of focus could be health care. Ransomware attacks -- hacks that lock up computer systems and demand a fee -- have put an even greater stress on hospitals across the country struggling with the coronavirus pandemic.  So far, the Biden administration has imposed cybersecurity requirements on sectors such as aviation and oil and gas pipelines. The genesis for those regulations in many ways was a May 2021 ransomware attack by an alleged Russian-speaking hacker that shut down 5,500 miles of fuel pipelines in the US for days. Corporations have sometimes balked at the regulations. After oil and gas industry groups complained that cybersecurity regulations from the Transportation Security Administration were too onerous and unrealistic, the Biden administration last year revised the regulations to give pipeline operators more time to report cyber incidents to the government. Multiple administrations, including the Trump and Obama administrations, have tried to shore up federal defenses against hacking threats and in some cases drive big changes that make agencies safer in the long term.  There has been some progress. Agencies now have more visibility into malicious cyber activity than ever before, officials say.  But in other cases, bureaucratic inertia has gotten in the way. The Government Accountability Office, a federal watchdog, says it has made over 700 public recommendations for federal agencies to improve their cyber defenses since 2010. About a fifth of the recommendations had not been implemented as of December, according to GAO. In the last month, the US Marshals Service was hit by a ransomware attack that affected sensitive law enforcement information, and the FBI has had to deal with a cyber incident involving a computer network used in investigations of child sexual exploitation. In the interview Thursday, Mayorkas said it was incumbent on the federal government to share what it learns from hacking incidents so the private sector can protect itself. ""The lessons learned should spread throughout the entire cyber ecosystem and not be limited to the particular domain in which it occurs,"" Mayorkas told CNN. Geopolitics has also been a roadblock to improved cybersecurity. The US has for years tried to blunt the impacts of hacking operations from Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, to limited effect. And US officials have accused all of those governments of harboring, or even enlisting, cybercriminals that attack US organizations -- accusations those governments deny. After the big pipeline hack in 2021, President Joe Biden made a big push to get Russian President Vladimir Putin to crack down on cybercriminals operating from Russia. But any chances of bilateral cooperation on cybercrime have dimmed after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine a year ago.  A senior administration official acknowledged the obstacle when rolling out the new cybersecurity strategy.  ""We do have a problem where Russia is serving as a de facto safe haven for cybercrime,"" the official told reporters. In the last few years, including during the Trump administration, US officials have rallied support from allies in Europe and elsewhere to condemn alleged hacking operations from Russia and China, and to arrest cybercriminals who travel to Europe. ""[T]he criminal justice isn't going to be able to on its own address this problem,"" the senior official added, ""so we do need to look at other elements of national power to be going after the threat.""

Opinion: What went right and wrong on Covid,2023-03-01,"The Chinese lab leak report from the Department of Energy saying it has ""low confidence"" that the Covid-19 virus accidentally escaped from a lab in Wuhan made headlines earlier this week. Then on Tuesday, FBI Director Christopher Wray weighed in, telling Fox News that ""the FBI has for quite some time now assessed that the origins of the pandemic are most likely a potential lab incident in Wuhan."" On Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning responded to that assessment, saying that the lab leak theory holds ""no credibility at all."" This all adds to the confusion surrounding the virus's origins. There is considerable science pointing to animal-to-human transmission as the origin of the virus, but there is also credible reporting and the FBI director's public assessment that it likely leaked from labs researching viruses in Wuhan. And we may never truly know how the Covid-19 virus originated because the Chinese government didn't allow international inspectors into Wuhan for weeks after a new mysterious, lethal virus first emerged there in December 2019. Initially, the local Wuhan government downplayed the virus. That doesn't necessarily mean they were covering up a lab leak, but rather this may point to simple incompetence -- a pretty good explanation of most human activity.  As CNN noted, ""top-down bureaucracy and rigid procedures that were ill-equipped to deal with the emerging crisis"" may have been to blame, a conclusion based on an examination of internal Chinese documents from the first months of the crisis. By the time the central Chinese government got serious about the virus, it was already spreading worldwide. While the new Department of Energy intelligence report does not settle the question of the precise origin of the virus, it does point us to the need for a bipartisan Covid-19 commission that goes well beyond US House investigations of Covid that are planned for this year. Consider that almost as many Americans have died of Covid-19 already -- some 1.1 million -- as have died in every war since the American Revolution. If that isn't a significant national security problem, I'm not sure what is. And yet the United States hasn't had any systematic examination by the government of how this happened. A good deal of that is likely because the whole issue of the pandemic is so politicized -- but so too were the debates about whether the George W. Bush administration might have done a better job thwarting the 9/11 attacks. The Bush administration initially blocked a commission to investigate 9/11. Following intense public pressure, the administration finally agreed to allow a commission to be formed more than a year after the attacks. The 9/11 commission not only told the whole backstory of the attacks, but it also proposed lasting reforms that made Americans safer when they were implemented, such as the creation of a National Counterterrorism Center that coordinates all counterterrorism intelligence across the US government and the creation of a new Office of the Director of National Intelligence which coordinates the work of all of the US intelligence agencies. A similar Covid-19 commission must be formed to investigate how the virus emerged, which responses to the virus worked or didn't work as it spread across the United States and the lessons learned for how best to prepare for the next pandemic. Each party should appoint subject matter experts on pandemics, epidemiology and emergency response to take part in this Covid-19 commission.  It should have sufficient staff and money and subpoena power to investigate questions such as, ""How did we get here?"" And, ""What can be done to mitigate the next pandemic?""   Of course, some questions may never be completely settled, like the lab leak theory vs. the natural transmission theory. Still, there are pressing questions that the Covid-19 commission should address so that we are better prepared for the next pandemic, which will inevitably eventually happen. Here are eleven questions that a Covid-19 commission could try and answer: Where did the coronavirus originate from?
After 9/11, the US spent many billions of dollars preparing for a possible bioterrorism attack. Where did all that funding go and why were those defenses against bioterrorism not more helpful in responding to the pandemic?
Why did the Trump administration eliminate the National Security Council's pandemic unit in 2018? What effect did that have?
 An early decision by former President Donald Trump during the pandemic was to bar non-US citizens who had recently visited China from entering the US. What kind of effect did that have on mitigating the spread of the virus? 
Why didn't the US government ensure there were enough medical-grade masks to cope with the pandemic when it started?
Why was there so little federal leadership on containing the virus in the early months of the pandemic? Those decisions were primarily left to individual states. What effect did this uncoordinated response have?
Trump said on February 26, 2020, that the number of Covid-19 cases would soon be close to zero. He also claimed that the coronavirus was no more dangerous than the flu. What effect did this have on the behavior of the American public and how did that behavior impact the spread of the virus?
What role did right-wing media play in downplaying the pandemic and how did that affect sentiments among some Republicans that the coronavirus was being hyped?
Dr. Deborah Birx, Trump's coronavirus response coordinator, told a congressional committee in closed-door testimony in 2021 that ""we probably could have decreased fatalities into the 30-percent-less to 40-percent-less range.""  How did she come to that conclusion?
To its credit, the Trump administration launched ""Operation Warp Speed,"" which saved many lives during the Covid-19 pandemic. As part of that effort, the US invested $2.5 billion in Moderna, which produced a testable vaccine on humans in only two months. Why did Operation Warp Speed work so well? And what are the lessons for future vaccine development? 
Covid-19 mortality rates per capita in the US are much higher than in other wealthy nations such as Canada, France, Germany and Japan. What went right in other countries that didn't go right in the US? If we get some reasonable answers to these and other questions, the next pandemic that rolls around may not claim more than a million American lives.","{'neg': 0.307, 'neu': 0.693, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.4767}",47,10.0,0.0252,0.8664,0.10840000000000001,0.13185,0.104,0.802,0.093,-0.9186,6.19695,20.62494076923078,179.0,0.11522313278899876
Fact check: Zelensky didn't say American sons and daughters have to fight in Ukraine,2023-03-02,"A viral video of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky takes his remarks out of context to wrongly make it sound like he demanded that Americans send their sons and daughters to fight in the war in Ukraine. The out-of-context 19-second video has been viewed millions of times on Twitter. It features a clip of Zelensky speaking at a news conference last week as an interpreter translates his words into English as follows: ""The US will have to send their sons and daughters, exactly the same way as we are sending, their sons and daughters to war. And they will have to fight, because it's NATO that we're talking about. And they will be dying, God forbid, because it's a horrible thing."" The clip has circulated widely on Twitter among critics of American financial and military support for the Ukrainian defense against Russia's invasion. Monica Crowley, a conservative commentator who served in the Trump administration as a spokesperson for the Treasury Department, posted the video on Tuesday night and wrote, ""Zelensky now directly threatening us and claiming American sons and daughters will have to fight and die for Ukraine. HELL NO."" Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah shared former Trump administration official William Wolfe's tweet of the video in which Wolfe claimed that Zelensky wants ""dead Americans on Ukrainian soil."" Lee himself added in a tweet on Tuesday night: ""Zelensky has no right to presume that our sons and daughters will fight his war. Shame on him. We've somehow sent the message that we work for him. Shame on us!""  Facts First: Zelensky did not say that American sons and daughters will have to fight in Ukraine or die for Ukraine. Rather, he predicted that if Ukraine loses the war against Russia because it does not receive sufficient assistance, Russia will proceed to enter North Atlantic Treaty Organization member countries in the Baltics (a region made up of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia) that the US will have to send troops to defend. Under the treaty that governs NATO, an attack on one member is considered an attack on all. Ukraine is not a NATO member. Lee deleted his tweet after CNN informed his office on Wednesday about how the video was taken out of context. Zelensky made the comments at a news conference on the anniversary of Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. He was asked what message he would give to the growing number of Americans who believe the US is giving Ukraine too much support. Zelensky began by saying, per the interpreter, ""I would like to thank all of the American people that are supporting Ukraine -- the Congress, the president, the TV channels, the journalists, and everyone that has been supporting us."" He urged the US to avoid losing its position of ""leadership"" in the world, asked Americans to see the Ukrainian people as similar to themselves, and said that while Ukraine enjoys ""bipartisan support"" in the US, he hears sentiments from time to time that are ""dangerous."" Soon after, he said, ""The US is never going to give up on the NATO member states. If it happens so that Ukraine, due to various opinions and weakening -- depleting -- of assistance, loses, Russia is going to enter Baltic states, NATO member states, and then the US will have to send their sons and daughters, exactly the same way as we are sending, their sons and daughters to war. And they will have to fight, because it's NATO that we're talking about. And they will be dying, God forbid, because it's a horrible thing. I wish peace and Ukrainian support to the United States."" Zelensky's critics are perfectly entitled to criticize his actual remarks about the necessity of continued US support for Ukraine. But it's just inaccurate to depict Zelensky's ""have to send their sons and daughters"" remark as a demand that Americans take part in combat on Ukrainian soil. Lee's office did not respond to a request for comment, and Crowley could not be immediately reached for comment. The out-of-context video has been fact-checked by Reuters and BBC journalist Shayan Sardarizadeh, among others.","{'neg': 0.167, 'neu': 0.833, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.3818}",31,11.0,0.1615,0.785,0.05349999999999999,-0.6423,0.103,0.839,0.058,-0.9803,-19.9113,5.670010000000008,186.0,0.030483924731182842
Opinion: The recipe for Ron DeSantis' success,2023-03-02,"The 2018 midterm elections were terrible for the Republican Party. The GOP lost 41 seats in the House of Representatives, and Democrats beat GOP candidates by more than 10 million votes — the largest raw vote margin in a House midterm election ever. Democrats also gained seven governorships that year.   Despite those anti-Republican hurricane-force headwinds, Republican Ron DeSantis beat Democrat Andrew Gillum in the Florida governor's race by 0.4%, or roughly 32,000 votes out of more than 8 million votes cast.  In the 2022 midterm elections, the anticipated bright-red ""tsunami"" evaporated into a colorless mist. Yet DeSantis scored an unprecedented victory for a Republican in Florida, beating his Democratic opponent by more than 19 percentage points and 1.5 million votes. When Republicans were asked who they would like to see as their party's nominee for 2024, a recent Monmouth University national poll showed DeSantis even with former President Donald Trump in a hypothetical field of seven and ahead of him in a direct head-to-head matchup. A Quinnipiac University poll found a near even race between Biden and Trump, with 48% supporting Biden and 46% supporting Trump, and a close race between DeSantis and Biden, with 47% supporting DeSantis and 46% supporting Biden. How has DeSantis gone from narrowly escaping defeat in 2018 to now becoming a formidable prospective contender for the White House?  His rapid national ascent began during the early pandemic in 2020 when he became a hero to millions for filling a vacuum of leadership at a time of global crisis and uncertainty.  Vulnerable older adults in Florida witnessed how he prioritized their health and safety by prohibiting transfers of patients infected with the coronavirus from hospitals into long-term care facilities, unlike in New York. Parents of Florida schoolchildren witnessed how he focused on keeping schools open, so students wouldn't fall behind in their learning. Small-business owners witnessed how he battled to get and keep businesses open, so they and their employees could continue to feed their families during the pandemic. Being the governor of tourism-rich Florida meant that voters within the state were not the only ones who noticed or benefited from DeSantis' pandemic leadership. Florida counted about 200 million visitors in 2020 and 2021. When visiting Florida, millions of domestic tourists experienced Florida's openness and returned home having personally experienced the benefits of DeSantis' leadership. DeSantis' governance style during the pandemic not only earned him respect from many around the country, but it also became a weathered template for other battles he has fought.  Here is the recipe for DeSantis' political success:   Step 1: Take decisive action. This step follows a counterintuitive political principle that DeSantis gets: It's more important for a leader to be decisive than for the decision itself to be popular. Voters do not want weathervanes for leaders. They appreciate a leader who takes bold action and gets things done much more than someone who constantly puts a finger in the wind, unsure of which direction to move next.   Step 2:  When possible, take your most decisive actions on issues that unite Republicans, divide Democrats and appeal to independents.   Step 3: Hope to be condemned by major news media outlets or scorned by elites in Hollywood or university faculty lounges.  Step 4: Stand your ground. Do not back down.   DeSantis' decisions on Covid-19 are prime examples of how this recipe worked. He was decisive, even when public opinion started out against him. He was criticized in news reports and by editorial boards, public health experts including Dr. Anthony Fauci -- then the nation's highest ranking government official on infectious disease -- and by Biden. Yet instead of hurting him politically, these criticisms only magnified DeSantis' street cred with so many Americans who wanted a champion to stand up against lockdowns.  The Florida governor has followed a similar playbook on other issues -- from immigration to education issues. In September, DeSantis flew migrants from Texas to Martha's Vineyard, where three municipalities had adopted sanctuary policies limiting local law enforcement from enforcing federal immigration laws. While editorials as well as local officials representing those sanctuary jurisdictions heaped scorn on DeSantis's decision, DeSantis was tapping into widespread national concern about the failure of border enforcement.  More than half of Americans believe it is completely or somewhat true that the United States is experiencing an invasion at the southern border, with 76% of Republicans and 47% of independents holding this view, according to an NPR/Ipsos poll in August. Meanwhile, 59% of Democrats and Democrat-leaning independents say border security should be very or somewhat important, and almost 4 of 10 Democrats say that increasing deportations is very or somewhat important, according to a Pew Research poll. This widespread bipartisan dissatisfaction on border enforcement provided a vast political space for DeSantis' decision to relocate migrants. DeSantis also supported a bill that prohibited classroom instruction about sexual orientation or gender identity to kindergarteners and other young students. Disney, a global entertainment conglomerate, opposed it and the hosts of the Academy Awards made fun of the bill on national television. But while Hollywood kingpins and celebrities disapproved of the bill, a New York Times-Siena College poll in September found Republicans united in opposition to such classroom instruction in first through fifth grades (95% against), while 42% of Democrats strongly or somewhat opposed it. More interestingly, 71% of independent voters strongly or somewhat opposed classroom instruction of gender identity to children in elementary school, the poll found.  DeSantis issued a proclamation declaring Florida native Emma Weyant the winner of the NCAA Division I women's 500-yard freestyle final after the NCAA declared Lia Thomas, a transgender woman, the victor. Just like the other issues DeSantis has taken on, Republicans and independent voters were strongly in favor of DeSantis' position, while Democrats were split almost evenly, according to a NPR/Ipsos poll.  Regardless of whether one agrees with his policies or his politics, DeSantis has shown he has a recipe for political and electoral success that has made him the governor of red-state America as well as an effective critic of progressive Democrats.  In today's ""cancel culture"" environment, DeSantis has uniquely channeled the emotions of what former President Richard Nixon called the ""silent majority."" That term is more politically potent now than it was then, because those voters who consider themselves part of this group -- regardless of whether they are a majority -- feel more silenced than ever.  One may be tempted to believe that such a strategy has limited appeal -- but consider the following: In 2020, although Trump beat Biden in Florida, Biden beat Trump by 11 points among independent voters. Yet two years later, DeSantis won back this important bloc of nonpartisan voters, winning a majority of independents and besting his Democratic opponent by 8 points among independents. DeSantis' proven ability to galvanize Republican voters and simultaneously appeal to a majority of independents is what makes him capable of winning both the GOP presidential nomination as well as the general election, should he choose to run next year.  It's a recipe that has worked brilliantly in Florida -- an incredibly diverse, multicultural and fast-growing megastate. Anyone who doesn't think it can work elsewhere may belatedly regret such skepticism in 2024.

Dueling CPAC and Club for Growth events highlight divide within GOP ahead of 2024,2023-03-02,"Two dueling high-profile Republican gatherings this week -- one featuring former President Donald Trump and the other Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis -- showcase the deepening divide within the GOP as it barrels toward its 2024 nominating process.  Trump is scheduled to headline the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland this week along with several conservative stars who have pushed election conspiracy theories and are closely allied with the former president. Meanwhile, DeSantis, who is expected to launch his own 2024 bid later this year, will skip the annual conference and is instead expected to be the main draw at the conservative group Club for Growth's private donor retreat in Florida this weekend.  Club for Growth, an anti-tax group at odds with Trump, is one of the biggest outside spenders in Republican politics. Trump was the only major 2024 hopeful not invited to the group's Palm Beach donor retreat, which is expected to be attended by several potential 2024 Republican candidates who have opted not to attend CPAC. Club for Growth plowed $2 million into DeSantis' reelection campaign for governor last cycle, according to Florida campaign filings. As the group focuses on DeSantis, it is also weighing launching a large-scale effort to boost an alternative to Trump in four early voting states, according to a source familiar with the discussions. A Club official said the organization was ""exploring a number of different strategies,"" but had nothing to announce yet. Former Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem and New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu are not on the schedule at CPAC but are expected to attend Club for Growth's event. All but Sununu have previously spoken at prior gatherings of CPAC, which has long been considered an essential stop for any potential presidential candidate working to build conservative support. Some Republicans linked the lackluster lineup at CPAC to recent allegations against Matt Schlapp, the president of the American Conservative Union, which puts on CPAC. A Republican strategist who was working for Herschel Walker's Senate campaign alleged that Schlapp sexually assaulted him and is suing Schlapp and his wife for more than $9 million. Schlapp has denied the claims.  ""It's a scandal,"" one Republican operative who has worked on several presidential campaigns told CNN. ""If you are thinking about running for president and you're not Donald Trump, you can't afford a misstep. You can't afford to be linked to a scandal."" There will be some crossover at the dueling events, including Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley, who will fly to Florida after speaking at CPAC on Friday, according to a Haley spokesman. GOP 2024 candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, an entrepreneur seen as a longshot to win the nomination, will also speak at both, per a source familiar with the planning. Republican Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Rick Scott of Florida, who have both said they're focused on their Senate reelections when asked about 2024, will also attend both CPAC and the Florida retreat. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin were invited to the Club for Growth retreat but are unable to attend, according to a source familiar with the planning. The Virginia state legislature concluded its session over the weekend but failed to reach an agreement on the state budget. Pompeo is scheduled to speak at CPAC, but Youngkin is not.  The rest of CPAC's lineup features a slate of prominent election deniers and close allies of Trump, including defeated Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake, MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, as well as Trump family members Donald Trump Jr. and Lara Trump.  ""It's clear that the leftist media is on a search and destroy mission against CPAC, its leadership, and the conservative movement,"" Megan Powers Small, a CPAC spokesperson, said. ""We could fill many more days of programming with all of the people who have requested to speak. Any suggestion to the contrary is disingenuous."" Club for Growth and Trump sparred during last year's primaries as they backed different candidates in key states holding Senate primaries, including Ohio. When it was reported last month that Trump was not invited to the Club for Growth summit, the former president slammed the group as ""an assemblage of political misfits, globalists, and losers"" and as ""Club for NO Growth"" on his Truth Social account.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.706, 'pos': 0.294, 'compound': 0.6124}",33,13.0,0.032888888888888884,0.8882222222222222,0.0788888888888889,0.1868285714285714,0.05,0.873,0.077,0.9144,6.165342857142856,8.114392857142864,195.0,0.0416122710622711
Biden's first-ever veto might be against the GOP war on 'woke' capitalism,2023-03-02,"Joe Biden could end up wielding the first veto of his presidency not on one of the great issues of state, but over a wonky skirmish sparked by the Republican Party's assault on what its culture warriors brand as ""woke"" capitalism.  Congress has sent to his desk a resolution overturning a Labor Department rule that allows managers of retirement funds to consider environmental and other factors when picking investments. The measure passed the Democratic-controlled Senate on Wednesday with the votes of all Republicans and two vulnerable Democrats. And now Biden has vowed to block it.  The showdown might seem obscure, but it is a barometer of the kind of cultural backlash agenda that is certain to shape the tense politics of the next two years in divided Washington and in the Republican primary in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election. The strategy is the latest front in the Republican Party's self-described war on ""woke"" -- in other words, their efforts to attack some climate change and social or racial equity policies that they believe will fire up their most conservative voters, many of whom fear their vision of American is under attack. The GOP is trying to define the next few years as a struggle between ""normal or crazy,"" as Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders characterized the divide during her response to Biden's State of the Union address.  The resolution Congress passed also shows how the GOP is increasingly unmoored from its role as the party of corporate America and Wall Street, as it seeks to weaponize the cultural anxieties of its most committed voters in red states. Investment firms had around $18 trillion in so-called Environmental, Social and Governance assets in 2021, according to PwC, which allow fund managers to make investing decisions based on such non-financial considerations. The GOP's assault on socially conscious corporations is being pioneered by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a likely 2024 contender who this week escalated his clash with the Walt Disney Company over its criticism of one of his laws that limits certain classroom instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity for young children.  The fact the anti-ESG measure made it to Biden's desk at all is one of the first illustrations of the delicate power balance in Washington given the new Republican majority in the House and the still fragile Democratic edge in the Senate. It passed the Senate by 50-46 on Wednesday with Democrats hurt by the absence of Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, who is hospitalized for depression. Two other Democrats, Sens. Joe Manchin from West Virginia and Jon Tester from Montana, voted with Republicans, reflecting tough reelection races both are likely to face next year in states former President Donald Trump won by double digits.  The resolution -- which, unlike major legislation, only required a majority to pass -- is likely to be the first of a flurry of Republican efforts to pass measures that have no chance of changing policy but that carry a hefty political message. Republicans slam 'liberal, left-wing agenda' Republicans argue that the Biden administration rule -- which reverses an attempt by the Trump White House to prohibit the consideration of ESG factors in investing -- would cost Americans financially by reducing the value of their investments, including 401k pension plans. GOP leaders also insist that investing based on environmental considerations could cost jobs in the fossil fuel industry, for instance.  The Biden rule, however, does not require investment managers to make such decisions; it merely allows them to do so if they are relevant to risk and return analyses. While the differences between the Biden and Trump rules are intricate, the issue has blown up because it offers the GOP an opening to pivot to its broader claims that Democrats are trying to embed liberal political principles in vast sectors of government, business and everyday life. ""What's happened here is the woke and weaponized bureaucracy at the Department of Labor has come out with new regulations on retirement funds, and they want retirement funds to be invested in things that are consistent with their very liberal, left-wing agenda,"" Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso said on Tuesday. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky accused the administration of wanting to let ""Wall Street use workers' hard-earned savings to pursue left-wing political initiatives."" But Biden has warned that American workers should have the ""fullest set of available tools"" to maximize returns on their life savings and pensions. He said in a statement threatening a veto that the Trump-era rule got between investment advisers and workers and stopped plan managers from ""considering all factors relevant to investment decisions."" If Biden vetoes the measure as expected, Republicans are certain to charge that he has capitulated to extreme left-wing influences in the Democratic Party. But Biden, adopting a populist tone, is criticizing the GOP measure for limiting American workers' earning potential from their savings. Democrats are also likely to charge that a far-right Republican Party is again demonstrating its cultural extremism and taking actions that could prejudice efforts to fight climate change and to foster racial equality. It is unlikely that there will be the sufficient two-thirds majority in the Senate and the House to overturn Biden's potential veto.  There is one another candidate for Biden's first presidential veto. Republicans are working to rescind a controversial Washington, DC, crime law that they argue is soft on violent offenders. A final Senate vote on the measure is expected next week. Manchin has already said he'd vote with Republicans, while Tester told reporters earlier this week he has not decided. The mantra that is taking over the GOP   The Republican campaign against ""wokeness"" is often hard to define and, in some cases, is a rhetorical device rather than a coherent set of policy programs. Often it is a mindset or definition that means different things to different people.  But generally, it is employed by Republicans to target the belief that there are systemic injustices in US society -- for instance, around race or sexuality -- and policy responses to try to mitigate them. More broadly, as in the case of ESG investing, the GOP war on ""woke"" policy is invoked to decry government or institutional efforts to make inclusionary or socially conscious decisions. In education, for example, Republicans often target the teaching of gender and sexuality issues that they think go against conservative values.  Critics, however, often view such campaigns as attempts to create political wedge issues, which only end up hurting vulnerable individuals and groups. While attacks on ""woke"" policies are allied to the ideology of Trumpism and his efforts to destroy government institutions, DeSantis has perfected the use of government power in what he's selling to conservatives as a defense of their values.  Among multiple efforts, DeSantis has used state power to prevent fund managers from using ESG considerations in investment decisions. His new book, ""The Courage to Be Free,"" which was published on Tuesday, bristles with countless references to ""woke"" ideology.  ""Woke capital exerts a pernicious influence on society in several ways. First corporations politicize the economy when they leverage their economic power to take positions on issues that do not directly affect their businesses,"" DeSantis wrote. The Florida governor also criticized what he sees as politicized companies that force employees to ""self-flagellate"" over concepts such as ""white privilege"" in diversity, equity and inclusion training. As Republicans in Congress pushed this campaign forward in Washington this week, DeSantis escalated his duel with Disney in Florida, giving him more power over its special tax district. Democrats have accused him of inappropriately using power in an act of personal and political revenge that pales in comparison with how he would use federal power if he ever makes it to the Oval Office.","{'neg': 0.262, 'neu': 0.738, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.5994}",47,14.0,0.08820000000000001,0.8422000000000001,0.0694,-0.05107999999999998,0.105,0.839,0.056,-0.9976,-2.400759999999999,8.239032857142863,206.0,0.03999530513176147
Opinion: Lori Lightfoot's fatal political mistake,2023-03-01,"Four years ago, Lori Lightfoot captured almost 74% of the vote en route to an historic election as Chicago's mayor. The first Black woman and first lesbian to lead the city, the former prosecutor upended the political establishment with promises to clean up a city weary of corruption. But, on Tuesday, Lightfoot's reign came to a screeching halt in a manner as stunning and decisive as the landslide that swept her into office. Lightfoot managed just 17% of the vote in a nine-way general election, failing to make the April 4 runoff that will now pit former school superintendent Paul Vallas against County Commissioner Brandon Johnson.   ""Obviously, we didn't win the election today, but I stand here with my head held high and a heart full of gratitude,"" Lightfoot told her supporters after the polls closed.  ""You will not be defined by how you fall. You will be defined by how hard you work and how much you do for other people,"" she added. It was a classy and dignified concession from a pugnacious mayor who often seemed to favor the middle finger over the middle ground. Lightfoot was smart, quick and always spoiling for fight, defending the city against its detractors -- from former President Donald Trump to Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas -- and anyone else who unfairly caricatured her city as an urban dystopia.  She stood up for immigrants and worked to refocus resources to impoverished neighborhoods on the city's south and west sides. Confronted with an unprecedented public health crisis within her first year in office, she generally won decent marks for her handling of it. But one element of that crisis -- the scourge of rampant violence that spiked during the pandemic -- contributed greatly to her repudiation at the polls on Tuesday. Crime -- a perennial issue that has bedeviled mayors for decades -- is far and away the top concern of Chicago voters. And while she could claim some progress in the past year over 2021, Lightfoot was widely considered a failure on the critical issue of public safety.  Her handpicked police chief, David Brown, recruited from Dallas, seemed overmatched in a city and a department often impenetrable to outsiders. And Lightfoot's unwillingness to dismiss her police chief, who often seemed isolated from his officers and the community, left voters with little hope for change. (Brown announced his resignation on Wednesday following Lightfoot's election loss.) But Lightfoot's fall is a more complicated story that goes to a clenched-fist, go-it-alone style of leadership that made consensus hard to build and drove many who should have been her allies away. Reared in the industrial belt of Northeast Ohio, the daughter of a factory worker and a health care aide, Lightfoot fought her way up to the University of Chicago Law School and, ultimately, to the US attorney's office with a stint as president of the Chicago Police Board. When she ran for mayor, her status as a crusading outsider with prosecutorial zeal was core to her appeal. But those pugilistic qualities quickly became obstacles in a job that often requires an ability to cajole, and not simply command. Early in her term, Lightfoot stubbornly took a teacher's strike many deemed avoidable, and then settled on the union's terms.  Deeply suspicious of the motives of other politicians, she systematically alienated Gov. J.B. Pritzker, the Democrat-led state legislature and the Cook County leadership, all of whom are fellow Democrats. As a result, she lost key legislative battles, including a law that over the next three years will shift control of the Chicago public schools from mayoral appointees to an elected 21-member school board, far larger than what she had wanted and the largest by far in the country.  She ran on limiting the prerogatives of City Council members, then humiliated them in her inaugural speech and alienated them in the job, prompting one of her once-allies Alderman Susan Sadlowski-Garza to say, ""I have never met anybody who has managed to piss off every single person they come in contact with. Police, fire, teachers, aldermen, businesses, manufacturing.""  The exodus of some high-profile businesses -- and the likely, unthinkable departure to the suburbs of the city's beloved Chicago Bears -- contributed to a sense of a city backsliding. By the time of the election, more than half of Chicago voters gave the mayor negative ratings.  In winning and losing, Lightfoot did it her way. Now Chicago will have a new mayor -- and a race that will be the most ideologically divergent in recent history. Vallas, who is White and endorsed by the Fraternal Order of Police, ran almost exclusively on public safety and the promise to add officers to fight crime. He finished with 34% of the vote, far ahead of the field, but well short of the 50% necessary to win without a runoff. Johnson, who is Black, was relatively unknown to much of the city before being put forth by the Chicago Teacher's Union, for whom he has worked as an organizer. Once a vocal supporter of defunding police, Johnson alone among the major candidates has eschewed promises of more cops.   It is a stark choice and portends a pitched and divisive battle. Fighter until the end, the mayor spent weeks of advertising, effectively hammering a fourth candidate she feared the most, US Rep. Jesus ""Chuy"" Garcia, only to be edged out for a spot in the runoff by Johnson. Now the reigning champion will be forced to watch from the sidelines and contemplate her meteoric rise and fall. Lightfoot was elected as a loner -- an outsider -- and to a shocking degree, she will leave City Hall the same way.

A lot of conservative 'churn' as Fox News is unmasked,2023-03-01,"The painful truth about email and text messages, which every TV anchor and media executive should learn, is that you never know which message will be publicly released when your company is sued. It's especially painful if, as is the case for Fox News anchors and executives, the messages appear to show you are knowingly allowing false information on the air.  Lawyers for Dominion Voting Systems released portions of unflattering messages and depositions in court filings as part of their $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against Fox for broadcasting conspiracy theories about Dominion's role in the 2020 presidential election. That's how we know Tucker Carlson tried to get a Fox News White House correspondent fired for fact-checking former President Donald Trump's false tweet about election fraud. ""Please get her fired,"" Carlson texted to fellow Fox News anchor Sean Hannity. ""Seriously ... what the f**k? I'm actually shocked ... It needs to stop immediately, like tonight. It's measurably hurting the company.""  Green was the most important color Note that he said company. The Fox leaders and top talent were focused on the company, not the country. Democracy was at stake, but the larger concern at Fox News appears to be that rival Newsmax was gaining traction after Trump lashed out at Fox News for his 2020 election loss. Fox Corporation chairman Rupert Murdoch didn't mind the politics of putting the conspiracy theory-pushing MyPillow CEO on Fox News, he said in a deposition, according to court records. ""It is not red or blue, it is green,"" Murdoch said, according to court documents.  Murdoch suggested firing the Fox News Washington bureau chief shortly after the network projected Joe Biden would win in Arizona, which had caught network anchors off guard and put the election all but out of reach for Trump. Fox denies any wrongdoing and has accused Dominion of cherry-picking quotes for its filing. There's a chicken or egg question in all of this  Did Fox viewers question the election because of what they saw on the network, or did Fox allow election falsehoods on its air because it feared its viewers? Former House Speaker Paul Ryan, who sits on the Fox Corporation board, sent an email to Murdoch about the circular false information loop -- election deniers ""got a diet of information telling them the election was stolen from what they believe were credible sources,"" he wrote. 'Scared to lose viewers' Murdoch told Ryan in one email that Hannity had ""been privately disgusted by Trump for weeks, but was scared to lose viewers."" CNN's Oliver Darcy has been all over this media story, which poses a real threat to Fox's credibility, such as it is:  Read more about what we've learned from Dominion's legal filing.
Read about what the lawsuit should mean for Fox News in the future. But the epic unmasking of Fox News also speaks to the tectonic movements on the American right wing. CNN's Stephen Collinson puts it perfectly: ""Fox News is the latest example of opinion formers on the right exposed for being held hostage to the fury they helped to incite. ... The new details underscored how key players on the right feel they have no choice but to appease, satisfy and further inflame the voters and viewers on whom their profits or hopes of political power depend."" 'Going through a lot of churn' Darcy notes that Ryan was grilled by a conservative commentator last week over his decision to remain on the board of directors of Fox News' parent company.  In the interview posted Tuesday on The Bulwark Podcast, Ryan said he believed Fox News is ""gonna have to be a part of the solution if we're going to solve the problem in the conservative movement."" ""Because there isn't a bigger platform than this in America,"" Ryan said. ""So I think the conservative movement is going through a lot of churn and a lot of turmoil and I don't like where it is right now."" That churn among conservatives is more and more evident. What's the Fox position on Ukraine?  During the George W. Bush administration, Fox would have been a major backer of military aid for Ukraine if Russia had invaded as it did a year ago. That perspective is still evident on the network, where many guests talk about the importance of Ukraine aid. But its top stars, like Carlson, are mimicking Trump and questioning whether the US should be opposed to Russia's authoritarianism and invasion of Ukraine. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Trump's current chief rival as they look ahead to the 2024 presidential race, represents the evolution in his own policy positions, as CNN's KFile notes: ""DeSantis wanted to send weapons to Ukraine when he was a congressman -- as a presidential hopeful he questions US involvement.""   Skipping CPAC Trump will appear this weekend at the Conservative Political Action Conference, long a major stop for potential Republican presidential candidates. The other major announced candidate, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, will also attend. But DeSantis, who is soft launching a nascent campaign, is skipping the event as he prepares promote his new book. He'll also pop into a private retreat for the anti-tax Club for Growth in Palm Beach, Florida, where he can hobnob with donors, according to Politico. Failure to endorse Trump's allies have been quietly trying to enlist hard-right lawmakers to back his third White House bid and give it some fresh momentum.  Perhaps surprisingly, they're running into some walls. CNN's Melanie Zanona and Manu Raju interviewed two dozen or so lawmakers that Raju described as ""hardcore Trump supporters, people who are part of the Freedom Caucus, people who were essentially his staunchest defenders during his four years in office."" ""Many of them are just not yet ready to commit,"" Raju told CNN's John King on ""Inside Politics.""  They're interested in DeSantis and even Haley and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott. ""The overriding concern among Republicans: They are concerned about Trump's viability as a candidate,"" Raju said. ""After he underperformed in the last three election cycles, they're worried that he could give Joe Biden another four years in the White House."" Multiple members of the Freedom Caucus actually traveled to Florida not to meet with Trump, but instead to talk to DeSantis, according to Raju. They were impressed. Rep. Ralph Norman told Raju the GOP has ""the best stable of candidates ever,"" and he is endorsing Haley, his fellow South Carolinian. Norman said he hopes other Republicans back new candidates. ""It's called democracy,"" Norman said. ""It's called the political process. When is it bad to get behind a candidate that you believe in?""

Takeaways from Attorney General Merrick Garland's Senate Judiciary Committee hearing,2023-03-01,"Attorney General Merrick Garland appeared before a Senate committee on Wednesday, where he faced a colorful array of questions on everything from the federal investigation into Hunter Biden to the sale of deadly drugs, Taylor Swift tickets and FBI investigations.  Garland's nearly four-hour-long hearing before the Democratic-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee marked his first trip to Capitol Hill this year. It comes as investigations into President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump have taken center stage in recent months. The attorney general's opening statement touched on topics like efforts to combat the rise of violent crime and hate crimes, work to protect reproductive freedom across the country, and the department's accomplishments in partnering with the Ukrainian government against Russian aggression.  ""Every day, the 115,000 employees of the Justice Department work tirelessly to fulfill our mission: to uphold the rule of law, to keep our country safe, and to protect civil rights,"" Garland said, lauding efforts to protect ""our country's democratic institutions."" Here are takeaways and key moments from the hearing:  Garland says he has not interfered in Biden probe Garland stressed that he will not interfere with the Delaware US attorney's ongoing investigation into Hunter Biden that is focused on taxes and other issues. ""I have pledged not to interfere with that investigation, and I have carried through on my pledge,"" Garland said, responding to questions from Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley on the probe.  Garland reiterated that the US Attorney in Delaware, David C. Weiss, has ""full authority"" to carry out the investigation and to bring in another jurisdiction if necessary. Garland said Weiss ""is not to be denied anything that he needs.""  He also said that it ""would be a national security problem"" if President Biden's son had been receiving payments from a foreign government as a means to influence the administration. ""If it's an agent of a foreign government asking someone and paying someone to do things to support that foreign government in secret, yes, I definitely think that would be a national security problem,"" Garland said. The questions reflect Republican suggestions that the younger Biden had made lucrative business deals because foreign governments were attempting to get to his father.  Hunter Biden has denied criminal wrongdoing in his business activities. Garland disavows memo referring to 'radical traditionalist' Catholics Garland disavowed an FBI field office memo that seemed to suggest the FBI was targeting ""radical traditionalist"" Catholics, calling the memo ""appalling"" and saying the FBI is investigating its origin. ""It's appalling. It's appalling,"" Garland said. The FBI ""has withdrawn it, and it's now looking into how this could ever happen,"" he added. Garland continued: ""The FBI is not targeting Catholics, and as I've said, this is an inappropriate memorandum. And it doesn't reflect the methods that the FBI is supposed to be using -- should not be relying on any single organization without doing its own work."" The memo was originally issued in a field office earlier this month and was almost immediately pulled.  In one exchange during Garland's hearing, Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri asked the attorney general whether the department had informants in Catholic churches. ""I don't believe we have any informants aimed at Catholic churches,"" Garland replied, adding: ""We have a rule against investigations based on First Amendment activity, and Catholic churches are obviously First Amendment."" ""Out department ... protects all religions and all ideologies, does not have any bias against any religion of any kind,"" he said. Tense exchange over DOJ and parents   Garland at one point engaged in a tense back-and-forth with Republican Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana about debunked claims that, under his leadership, the DOJ is trying to interfere with parents' ability to make complaints about schools. The claims stems from a 2021 letter from The National School Boards Association asking the DOJ to ""deal with"" the uptick in threats against education officials and equating that activity to ""domestic terrorism."" Garland released a memo encouraging federal and local authorities to work together against the harassment campaigns levied at schools, but never endorsed the ""domestic terrorism"" notion.   ""Didn't you understand the chilling effect that it would have to parents when you issued your directive -- when you directed your criminal divisions and your counter terrorism divisions, to investigate parents who are angry at school boards and administrators during Covid?"" Kennedy asked.   ""I did not do that. I did not issue any memorandum directing the investigation of parents who are concerned about their children,"" Garland shot back, adding that to the contrary, the memo states ""that vigorous public debate is protected by the First Amendment and the kind of concerns that you're talking about, as expressed by parents, are of course completely protected.""   He later added: ""This is about the third time I'm being asked about the same memorandum and each time I've said, and I hope that the senators would go ahead and advise their constituents in the same way, that this is not what we do.""   ""We are not in any way trying to interfere with parents making complaints about the education of their children,"" Garland said.   Targeting online sale of deadly drugs Judiciary Committee Chairman Dirk Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, pushed Garland on whether social media companies should be liable for the illegal sale of deadly drugs, comparing their online sale to a ""suicide pact."" ""I don't want to put words in your mouth, but I think Section 230 has become a suicide pact,"" Durbin said, referring to a section of the Communications Decency Act that shields tech platforms from being sued over the content users post. ""We have basically said to these companies, 'you are absolved from liability, make money' ... and deaths result from it, and we have a responsibility."" Garland agreed that ""we do have to do something to force (tech platforms) to provide information, to search their own platforms for sales of illegal drugs,"" and pledged that the committee has the DOJ's support in efforts to reduce the online sale of deadly drugs and target algorithms that may be boosting their sale.   The attorney general added that the department supports ""a better way to get the social media companies, whether it's civil or criminal, to take these kinds of things off their platforms."" Security for Supreme Court justices Garland was grilled by Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee about the absence of charges -- after demonstrators protested for weeks in front of the justices' residences in the wake of the leaked opinion to overturn Roe v. Wade opinion -- under a law that prohibits ""picketing or parading"" in front of a federal judge's home. ""It is concerning to me,"" Lee said. ""When you show up at the home of a public official, you're sending the message of implicit violence."" The attorney general said he did not know if the department had brought any cases under the statute. But, Garland said, the ""thing that mattered"" was his move, after the leak of a draft opinion, to order the US Marshals Service to protect the justices and their homes 24/7. ""No attorney general ever ordered that before. And no Justice Department had ever done that before,"" Garland said, adding that 70-plus US Marshals were deployed for the protection of the justices. ""They are on site, but their priority job is protection,"" Garland said. ""That is why when someone did come to assault Justice (Brett) Kavanaugh, he had to walk -- go away from where they were, because there were two marshals in front of the house -- and eventually he self-reported (himself)."" How the US Marshals handled the alleged assassination attempt against Kavanaugh has been scrutinized. The man accused of attempting the attack was only apprehended after he texted his sister and she called 911, according to information released by local law enforcement. Quoting Taylor Swift  At least two senators brought up a controversy surrounding Ticketmaster after the service failed to process orders for Taylor Swift's upcoming tour, leaving millions of fans unable to buy tickets or without their ticket even after purchase.  The Justice Department has reportedly opened an antitrust investigation into Live Nation Entertainment, the owner of Ticketmaster. Garland said that any concentrated industry is a ""problem for competition"" as he faced questions about the probe, and, quoting Swift, said the department knows ""all too well"" about the importance of industry competition. He told senators that ""you can be confident that in all of our work, we approach it with an understanding that highly concentrated industries are a problem for competition."" Not revisiting internal DOJ legal stances Garland refused to commit to revisiting internal DOJ legal stances that are issued in opinions from the department's Office of Legal Counsel, even if those stances have been rejected by federal judges. OLC opinions do not carry the legal weight of a ruling from a court, but are binding across the agencies of the executive branch. Critics of the OLC's continued embrace of its positions -- and particularly positions asserting sweeping executive privileges  -- say that it allows the White House to avoid scrutiny by lawmakers with years of litigation over congressional subpoenas. Garland was questioned on the issue by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, who pointed specifically to a ruling by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson -- from when she sat on the federal district court in DC -- that rebuked the department's position that an ""absolute immunity"" precludes close presidential advisers from even appearing for testimony when subpoenaed by Congress. ""You have OLC opinions that appear to be flat out wrong by the determinations made by those whose job it is to say what the law is -- the Article III judge -- and there's no effort to ask them in that fairly unique circumstance to go back and ... fix it,"" said Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island. Garland cited the resource constraints the OLC faces and suggested that the office was more likely to revisit a position if it was deemed unlawful by the Supreme Court, or perhaps a federal appeals court. ""There are lots of judges who criticize OLC opinions and the Justice Department,"" Garland, who once sat on DC's federal appeals court, said. ""As a former judge, that's perfectly appropriate for Article III judges to do, but we have to allocate our resources to cases where -- which are active cases.""

Opinion: Ron DeSantis' new book offers a powerful warning to the US electorate,2023-03-01,"As is increasingly apparent in many of his public appearances, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is rather like Donald Trump, only without the charm.  And that charmless demeanor seeps through his latest book, ""The Courage to Be Free: Florida's Blueprint for America's Revival,"" a grievance-laden tome written in advance of a presumed bid for the Republican nomination in the 2024 presidential election.   The question is, will it help his chances?   That's unlikely. Only fans or parties actively looking for someone to back in 2024 will read the book, and within a few months unsold copies will lie on the remainder tables, rubbing shoulders with Mike Pompeo's new memoir, ""Never Give an Inch,"" or past examples of campaign self-advertisements such as ""A Call to Service"" by John Kerry, ""A Time for Truth"" by Ted Cruz or even Trump's ""Crippled America."" I've read a number of these books and they're rarely good. Nevertheless, DeSantis takes the usual dullness to a fresh level, redefining what cliched writing can sound like.  It's one thing to offer the public a bit of wooden prose, but DeSantis gives us an entire lumber yard.  I don't blame DeSantis entirely for that lousy prose. Like most politicians, he's a busy man who will have likely farmed out the writing of his book to nameless minions.  The governor doubtless talked at length to the ""hardworking team of literary professionals"" mentioned in his acknowledgments; these ghostwriters will have also had his speeches, social media feeds, appearances and policy papers to draw on.  And we can be sure the governor read the book and approved of its contents before publication. So we must assume the ideas (and ""ideals"") in this book, such as they are, belong to him.  That's not a good thing. As one might expect, the book runs through DeSantis' life and times, talking about his love of baseball and hard work; about his parents and their working-class roots in Pennsylvania and Ohio.  They were Italian-Americans — a family of immigrants, although DeSantis has shown little interest in helping recently-arrived migrants on their American journey: he famously flew two planeloads, primarily comprised of Venezuelan migrants, from Texas to Martha's Vineyard in 2022, a cruel, calculated political stunt designed to embarrass the Biden administration and liberal elites with their ""sanctuary cities.""  That he would play politics with the lives of these poor souls doesn't, I fear, speak well for him -- nor that he performed throughout the ensuing media cycle with such glee. But this hard-heartedness is a core part and parcel of the narrative, which offers a litany of resentfulness.  ""Before my time at Yale,"" DeSantis writes of his undergraduate years studying history at the Ivy League school, ""I had never seen a limousine, much less a limousine liberal. Those students who were the most strident in their leftism... came from the most privileged background."" He experienced ""unbridled leftism"" on campus, and this pushed him far to the right, where he has remained.   Everywhere in the book, one senses his rage against political correctness. He rails, on nearly every page, about ""the woke agenda"" that he sees permeating almost every level of life in America.  In DeSantis' mind, a dire phalanx of ""woke"" fanatics is led ""by the likes of Dr. Anthony Fauci,"" who is seen as public enemy #1. He devotes a whole chapter of this book to railing against Dr. Fauci and people who used the powers of the federal government to implement ""heavy-handed public health 'interventions'"" during the Covid-19 pandemic. These measures did little, in the governor's opinion, to slow the course of the disease — rather, they ""destroyed livelihoods, hurt children, and harmed overall public health.""  (The jury is probably still out on how DeSantis governed with regard to the pandemic. It's possible he had some good instincts at work.) The title of this book must surely be ironic: ""The Courage to Be Free."" DeSantis is all about the restriction of freedoms wherever possible. He wants to cancel librarians who allow kids to read certain Black or LGBTQ writers and to fire tenured professors in the state university system who teach ""woke"" ideas. He wants to restrict the rights of women seeking abortions and those of LGBTQ people seeking to live their lives. He hopes to punish corporations, such as the Walt Disney Company, for criticizing his policies.  Again and again, DeSantis shows little interest in the First Amendment — except when his own free speech is concerned.  He seems not to have heard the great words of Thomas Jefferson, who wrote: ""Our liberty depends on the freedom of the press, and that cannot be limited without being lost."" Jefferson understood that we each have a right, even a patriotic duty, to speak without permission from the authorities. Instead, DeSantis rails against the ""legacy media"" — by which he means The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Atlantic and so forth. These are ""the praetorian guard of the nation's failed ruling class, running interference for elites who share their vision and smearing those who dare of oppose it."" (I suspect he would, no doubt, wish to exempt Rupert Murdoch's media empire from this judgment.) So, if ""The Courage to Be Free"" is a sign of things to come, DeSantis will likely hang his presidential campaign on efforts to find what he calls the ""pressure points"" in the system, finding ways to ""leverage"" his authority to advance his agenda. He's a lawyer, as he reminds us, educated at the famous Harvard Law School. If the book is any guide, he's going to use his lawyerly skills to dismantle our heritage and, in his Orwellian manner, he's going to proclaim that he's freeing us by doing so. Overall, I found the hectoring quality of DeSantis oppressive.  He's a chilly man, with a heart of ice and — like so many politicians on both the right and left these days — full of resentments, grudges and the urge to destroy anyone who doesn't agree with him.  The courage he claims for himself he would deny to many others. I shudder to think what he might do if handed the presidential bully pulpit.   The good news, I suppose, is that the lack of charm this book illustrates could well severely limit his chances of success on the national stage.

Colorado discipline office moves toward ethics complaint against ex-Trump attorney for 2020 election gambits,2023-02-24,"The disciplinary office that regulates attorney conduct in Colorado is taking steps toward potentially bringing an ethics complaint against Jenna Ellis, the lawyer who played a prominent role in former President Donald Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 election.  Colorado's Attorney Regulation Counsel, an independent office in the state, indicated last week that it had been authorized to prepare and file a formal complaint against Ellis, according to a February 17 email provided to CNN by Project 65, a group of bipartisan lawyers that is asking for disciplinary action against Ellis and other pro-Trump attorneys who tried to overturn and undermine the 2020 election. ""We expect the Complaint will be filed within the next month or so,"" said the email, which was sent to the head of a group that asked the disciplinary office to investigate Ellis. Under Colorado attorney disciplinary rules, the office still has the option to reach a settlement or stipulation with Ellis at this point in the process, so it's not guaranteed that an ethics complaint will ultimately be filed against her.  Jessica Yates, who runs the disciplinary office, told CNN that the office cannot comment on specific cases. The email was sent to Michael Teter, the managing director of the 65 Project. Ellis did not respond to CNN's attempts to reach her for comment. When the 65 Project asked for the ethics investigation into Ellis last March, she told CNN that she would not be ""intimidated by this dirty political maneuver to undermine the legal profession.""  Teter told CNN that the recent move by the disciplinary office ""demonstrates the seriousness of her misconduct in her attempt to overturn the 2020 election by abusing the court system and making fraudulent, baseless allegations."" Ellis was the public face of many of Trump's election-reversal gambits, working on Trump's legal efforts as well as the failed bid to convince state legislatures to nullify President Joe Biden's win.  Several other Trump-aligned lawyers have faced potential professional consequences -- including the possibility of suspension or disbarment -- for their post-election legal conduct. However, some of the bids to discipline those attorneys have run into roadblocks. The disciplinary action that was brought against Sidney Powell, who put forward some of the most outlandish false claims about the presidential vote, was thrown out by a Texas judge on Thursday. But an attorney disciplinary committee in DC made the preliminary finding last year that former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani violated ethics rules for his work on a Trump lawsuit that tried to throw out hundreds of thousands of votes in Pennsylvania. There will be more rounds of appeal before that finding is finalized and a punishment is handed down, but the DC Bar's disciplinary counsel has asked for Giuliani to be disbarred. And Jeffrey Clark, the former Justice Department lawyer who tried unsuccessfully to get the department to validate Trump's false voter fraud claims, is also facing attorney ethics proceedings in DC. If the attorney regulation counsel in Colorado moves forward with a complaint against Ellis, and there isn't a settlement, the matter will be go through rounds of proceedings in front of a disciplinary judge, including a potential trial-like hearing before a panel made up of the judge and two other volunteers. The decision by that panel can then be appealed to the Colorado Supreme Court.   The movement from the disciplinary counsel towards a complaint against Ellis was first reported by Colorado Newsline.","{'neg': 0.145, 'neu': 0.855, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.296}",19,19.0,0.08800000000000001,0.8174999999999999,0.09449999999999999,-0.05888333333333331,0.076,0.875,0.049,-0.9478,-1.1187833333333328,20.31785666666667,219.0,0.09277560121765603
Paul Ryan grilled for remaining on Fox board of directors amid election fraud revelations,2023-03-01,"Former House Speaker Paul Ryan was grilled last week over his decision to remain on the board of directors of Fox News' parent company after damning court documents showed that the right-wing network knowingly peddled election lies to its audience. In the interview, conducted by conservative commentator Charlie Sykes at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and posted Tuesday on The Bulwark Podcast, Ryan was asked how he could associate himself with a company that ""is pumping toxic sludge, racism, disinformation, and attacks on democracy."" ""Do you have any responsibility?"" Sykes asked. ""I do. I have a responsibility to offer my opinion and perspective and I do that, but I don't go on TV and do it, right. So I offer my perspective, my opinion, often,"" Ryan replied. ""I'll just leave it at that."" Sykes continued pressing Ryan.  ""Is there a red line for you at any point where you said, ""'I cannot be associated with a company that does this'?"" Ryan declined to directly answer the question. Instead, Ryan said, ""I want to see the conservative movement get through this moment. And I think Fox is a big part of the constellation of the conservative movement."" ""Is it the solution or the problem?"" Sykes asked. Ryan said he believed Fox News is ""gonna have to be a part of the solution if we're going to solve the problem in the conservative movement."" ""Because there isn't a bigger platform than this in America,"" Ryan said. ""So I think the conservative movement is going through a lot of churn and a lot of turmoil and I don't like where it is right now."" Ryan and other Fox Corporation board members have faced scrutiny for not doing enough to prevent executives at Fox News from allowing lies about the 2020 election to be knowingly promoted to the network's millions of viewers. In the latest legal filing Monday from Dominion Voting Systems, it was revealed that behind the scenes, Ryan pleaded with Fox Corp. chairman Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan Murdoch, the Fox Corp. CEO, to prevent Trump's bogus election claims from being broadcast to Fox News' audience of millions. Ryan, according to messages uncovered in the case, said that Fox News should ""move on from Donald Trump"" and ""stop spouting election lies."" But Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, the renowned professor and senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management, told CNN that Ryan's actions were not enough.

Fact check: Marjorie Taylor Greene falsely claims Biden administration is responsible for Michigan brothers' fentanyl deaths during Trump administration,2023-03-01,"Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia falsely claimed Tuesday that the Biden administration is responsible for the fentanyl deaths of two young men who actually died during the Trump administration -- and her congressional spokesperson profanely dismissed questions about the false claim as irrelevant. Michigan mother and conservative activist Rebecca Kiessling testified to the House Homeland Security Committee on Tuesday about how her sons Caleb, 20, and Kyler, 18, had died on July 29, 2020, as a result of fentanyl poisoning from taking pills Kiessling said they had mistakenly believed were safer pain pills.  Kiessling made an emotional plea for stronger federal action to prevent the importation of fentanyl over the southern border, claiming, ""You're welcoming drug dealers across our border!"" (Fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid, is largely smuggled in by US citizens through legal ports of entry rather than by migrants sneaking past unprotected stretches of the border.) Then, later in the day, Greene tweeted a video of an exchange she had with Kiessling at the hearing. But Greene wrongly suggested in the tweet that Kiessling had blamed the Biden administration for the death of her sons. In fact, Kiessling had explicitly told the committee the date of the tragedy, making clear that it happened with more than five months left in the presidency of Donald Trump. ""Listen to this mother, who lost two children to fentanyl poisoning, tell the truth about both of her son's murders because of the Biden administrations refusal to secure our border and stop the Cartel's from murdering Americans everyday by Chinese fentanyl,"" Greene tweeted.  Greene, who supported the Trump presidency and has endorsed his 2024 run, has more than 2 million followers on Twitter. CNN reached out to the spokesperson for her congressional office, Nick Dyer, on Tuesday night to ask for comment on the false claim and to ask whether Greene had any plans to delete or correct the tweet. Dyer responded in an email by asking whether CNN thinks the many Americans who have died from drugs under Biden ""care about the details"" of this particular case. He added, ""Do you think they give a f**k  about your bullsh*t fact checking?""  Unrelated to CNN's inquiry, a fact check notice was affixed to the bottom of Greene's tweet later Tuesday night through Twitter's ""community notes"" crowdsourcing feature. The tweet had been viewed more than 3 million times before noon on Wednesday. Asked about the tweet, Kiessling, an anti-abortion advocate who has been active in the Republican Party grassroots, noted in an email on Wednesday morning that the number of fentanyl deaths increased sharply between 2020 and 2021. She argued that ""if the border had been secured during the Obama administration when the federal government first knew of this issue, my sons would be alive today."" Kiessling concluded: ""The whole of our federal government has failed, Congress included."" US deaths from fentanyl and other synthetic opioids first spiked under Obama in the mid-2010s, then continued to rise under Trump and accelerated again during the Covid-19 pandemic, including early in Biden's presidency. There have recently been preliminary signs of improvement in US overdose-death numbers, though they remain much higher than they were in 2020 and earlier.  Greene's election lies  Greene's false tweet about the Biden administration was not her only dishonest claim that day.  At a Tuesday meeting of congressional Republicans' caucus on ""election integrity,"" Greene castigated a Georgia Republican election official, Gabriel Sterling, who has repeatedly vouched for the integrity of the 2020 election in the state. Greene's comments, which she also posted on Twitter, featured a variety of lies that were long ago debunked by Sterling and many others. Greene falsely claimed that ""Trump won Georgia,"" though he lost by 11,779 votes, fair and square, in a state with a Republican governor, Republican elections chief and Republican-controlled legislature. She falsely claimed that there were ""thousands of dead voters in Georgia,"" though Georgia elections officials have found only four such cases in the 2020 election to date and Trump allies' claims about various other supposedly deceased voters have been disproven by CNN and others. And she falsely claimed that a video showed workers in Atlanta's Fulton County doing something nefarious while counting ballots, though the workers were simply doing their jobs and though false claims about the video have been debunked not only by Sterling but by Trump's deputy attorney general and a Trump-appointed former US attorney in Georgia, among others. Greene has been persistently inaccurate about the 2020 election. Dyer, Greene's spokesperson, responded with a profane dismissal when asked for comment Tuesday night about Greene's latest false election claims.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.887, 'pos': 0.113, 'compound': 0.3182}",26,22.0,0.05142857142857143,0.8758571428571429,0.07271428571428572,-0.06115999999999999,0.095,0.82,0.085,-0.9617,-1.5901599999999998,18.928706666666674,122.0,0.1551533333333334
"Near bomb-grade level uranium found in Iranian nuclear plant, says IAEA report",2023-03-01,"Uranium particles enriched to near bomb-grade levels have been found at an Iranian nuclear facility, according to the UN's nuclear watchdog, as the US warned that Tehran's ability to build a nuclear bomb was accelerating.  In a restricted report seen by CNN, the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed that uranium particles enriched to 83.7% purity -- which is close to the 90% enrichment levels needed to make a nuclear bomb -- had been found in Iran's Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant (FFEP), an underground nuclear facility located some 20 miles northeast of the city of Qom.  The report says that in January, the IAEA took environmental samples at the Fordow plant, which showed the presence of high enriched uranium particles up to 83.7% purity.   The IAEA subsequently informed Iran that these findings were ""inconsistent with the level of enrichment at the Fordow plant as declared by Iran and requested Iran to clarify the origins of these particles,"" added the report.  Iran's stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60% had also grown from 25.2 kg to 87.5 kg since the last quarterly report, according to the confidential IAEA report.  The IAEA report said discussions with Iran to clarify the matter are ongoing, noting that ""these events clearly indicate the capability of the IAEA to detect and report changes in the operation of nuclear facilities in Iran.""  In an exclusive interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Tuesday, Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian did not directly respond to a question on reports of the enrichment.  Amir-Abdollahian said that the deputy director general of the IAEA, Massimo Aparo, had visited Iran on two occasions in the past weeks and that the IAEA's director general Rafael Grossi has been invited to visit the country.    ""We have a roadmap with the IAEA. And on two occasions, Mr. [Massimo] Aparo, Mr. [Rafael] Grossi's deputy, came to Iran in the past few weeks, and we had constructive and productive negotiations. And we have also invited Mr. Grossi to come and visit Iran soon,"" Amir-Abdollahian told CNN.  ""Therefore our relationship with the IAEA is on its correct, natural path."" Last year, Iran removed all of the IAEA equipment previously installed for surveillance and monitoring activities related to the nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).  The move had ""detrimental implications for the IAEA's ability to provide assurance of the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programme,"" the IAEA report stated.  A US State Department spokesperson on Tuesday said the IAEA report potentially poses a ""very serious development.""  ""We are in close contact with our allies and partners in Europe and the region as we await further details from the IAEA on this potentially very serious development,"" added the spokesperson.   Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl on Tuesday said that ""Iran's nuclear progress since"" the Trump administration withdrew the US from the 2015 nuclear deal ""has been remarkable,"" adding that in 2018, when the US withdrew, ""it would have taken Iran about 12 months to produce one fissile, one bomb's worth of fissile material."" ""Now it would take about 12 days,"" he said. More than a year of indirect negotiations between the US and Iran to try to restore the 2015 nuclear deal broke down in September 2022. Tensions between the two countries only worsened after Iran's crackdown on nationwide protests at home, and as Tehran supplied Russia with drones in the Ukraine war.  Kahl said Tuesday that the agreement is ""on ice.""","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",20,23.0,0.0,0.895,0.105,0.6369,0.047,0.895,0.058,0.3847,12.738,13.142506666666673,96.0,0.13690111111111117
"Fox executives should be fired for 'proven misconduct' exposed in Dominion lawsuit, renowned Yale professor says",2023-03-01,"The Fox Corporation board has a huge mess on its hands — and it needs to work quickly to clean it up.  That's according to Jeffrey A Sonnenfeld, the renowned professor and senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. Sonnenfeld told CNN on Tuesday that the dramatic revelations brought to light by Dominion Voting Systems' $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against Fox News — showing it knowingly peddled election lies to its audience — are cause for serious concern that could threaten the parent company. The filings, he said, showed members of the Fox Corp board had failed to act to prevent misconduct by Fox executives, and warned the disclosures will result in ""likely"" shareholder lawsuits, a possible SEC investigation into ""deceptive practices of the board for conspiring to conceal known misconduct with material adverse impact,"" and the potential loss of insurance protection for the company's directors and officers. Sonnenfeld, who has advised hundreds of CEOs and recent US presidents, said the board should take immediate action, including the removal of high-ranking personnel, such as Fox News chief executive Suzanne Scott, from their roles. A version of this article first appeared in the ""Reliable Sources"" newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.   ""The board has a duty to remove such officials for proven misconduct,"" Sonnenfeld told CNN by email, explaining that peddling known election lies — as ""acknowledged in the company's own sworn testimony"" — damaged the outlet's corporate reputation. ""If the board does not act appropriately,"" Sonnenfeld added, ""it shows a failure of management oversight and jeopardizes their own directors and officers insurance protection with such gross conscious failure of diligent management oversight."" A lack of action by the board could result in additional legal exposure to Fox, Sonnenfeld warned. ""Murdoch 'only' controls 39% of the company so any of the 61% of the shareholders can sue for misconduct, failure of management oversight, and conscious inadequate diligence,"" he explained. In the latest Dominion legal filing, it was revealed that behind the scenes, Fox Corp board member Paul Ryan pleaded with Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch to prevent Trump's bogus election claims from being broadcast to Fox News' audience of millions. The former House speaker said that Fox News should ""move on from Donald Trump"" and ""stop spouting election lies."" But Sonnenfeld said Ryan's actions were not enough. In fact, he said Ryan's ""quiet dissent"" was ""cowardly, ineffective, and immoral,"" and pointed out that board members have certain responsibilities under corporate governance law in Delaware, where Fox is incorporated.  ""The duties of loyalty and diligence are NOT to the management but to the owners,"" Sonnenfeld said. ""By silently going along with misconduct about which they are aware, all directors, including Paul Ryan, are guilty of complicity through their complacency."" Sonnenfeld said that if he were advising Fox's board members, he would recommend an immediate investigation into ""how far, wide, and deep the misconduct ran -- with an outside, independent law firm reviewing the sworn testimony, now public, and conducting follow-ups."" Sonnenfeld said that Viet D Dinh, Fox's chief legal and policy officer, and Kevin Lord, chief human resources officer, ""should share whistleblower complaints and exit interviews with the board."" ""The investigation should be completed with a report to the shareholders by May 1 indicating what disciplinary actions will be taken,"" he said. Sonnenfeld also said the directors and officers insurers ""should be contacted to see"" if board members ""are still protected."" Nell Minow, vice chair at ValueEdge Advisors and expert on corporate governance, told CNN she agreed with everything that Sonnenfeld said. Minow said that she would tell concerned board members to ""contact their largest shareholders to hear their suggestions for new independent directors."" Minow also recommended Fox News immediately move to settle its case with Dominion, ""even if it means changing the name from News to Not News and daily free ads 10 times a day in prime time for 10 years about the integrity and reliability of Dominion."" Spokespeople for Fox Corp and Fox News, which have claimed Dominion has cherrypicked quotes to use against them, did not respond to requests for comment. Fox News has previously said it was ""proud"" of its 2020 election coverage, which is a statement that only grows more remarkable by the day.","{'neg': 0.343, 'neu': 0.657, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.7003}",26,24.0,0.0545,0.9135,0.032,-0.07144999999999999,0.059,0.885,0.055,0.7086,-1.8576999999999997,12.403590000000007,103.0,0.12042320388349521
Fox learns the hard way about being beholden to the GOP base,2023-03-01,"""You Can't Always Get What You Want"" has long been the anthem to Donald Trump triumphantly walking off stage after his rallies. But the ex-president's entire political career, the modern Republican Party and a vast conservative media empire are based on the exact opposite premise of the Rolling Stones' song: giving the party base exactly what it wants to hear -- whether it is true or not. Fox News is the latest example of opinion formers on the right exposed for being held hostage to the fury they helped to incite. Extraordinary revelations this week from a defamation lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems showed that Fox Corporation Chairman Rupert Murdoch admitted under oath that some of the channel's top stars endorsed false claims that the 2020 election was stolen as he tried to stop viewers from defecting. Previous disclosures showed some of those Fox hosts knew they were peddling lies but were worried they'd alienate their audience if they told the truth about Trump's false claims. The new details underscored how key players on the right feel they have no choice but to appease, satisfy and further inflame the voters and viewers on whom their profits or hopes of political power depend. The GOP's most fervent, constantly self-radicalizing voters have long led its leaders. GOP luminaries who resist the tide, like former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, ex-Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake and former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, see their careers expire. Those that buy in -- like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis or New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, now a member of the House GOP leadership team -- can rocket to prominence. But such a strategy can risk being turned into a Faustian bargain. In Fox's case, Murdoch's testimony left the network in serious legal jeopardy and shredded its journalistic reputation.  Some media commentators would argue that Murdoch's entire business model -- using television stations in his native Australia and tabloid newspapers like The Sun in Britain, as well as Fox News in the US -- has evolved from seizing upon and feeding political anger. And while he's more known for backing conservatives, Murdoch has switched sides when business demands -- for instance, when The Sun endorsed the British Labour Party's Tony Blair over the fading Conservative Party in a 1997 general election.  There are also signs that the billionaire publisher may finally be getting buyer's remorse over Trump given the headline in his New York Post after the ex-president's low energy 2024 campaign launch in November, which read, ""Been there, Don that."" As he said in a deposition made public in a court filing on Monday in the Dominion case: ""It is not red or blue, it is green,"" referring to the color of a dollar. Republicans know where their power comes from  The Republican politicians who appear on Fox are influenced by a similar calculation of what the political market will bear. Their unfiltered adoption of much of the doctrine favored by the conservative grassroots ultimately stretched American democracy to the limit. Catering to that base helped fuel the rise of Trump in 2016, as he shattered the Republican establishment presidential field. GOP lawmakers whose hold on power depended on not crossing the reality-star-turned-president then allowed Trump to run riot. That helped foster an unstoppable radical tide that led to the US Capitol insurrection in 2021 and eventually to Republicans acquitting him in not one but two impeachment dramas. There is every sign that the dominance of this Republican base still reigns supreme as a new GOP presidential campaign dawns. Trump is still the biggest name in the race, but his top potential rival is expected to be DeSantis, who bills himself as a hardline leader who can implement Trumpism better than its author but without the chaos that enveloped his presidency. In interviews with roughly two dozen members of the House's ""MAGA"" wing, many told CNN's Melanie Zanona and Manu Raju that they were not yet ready to commit to Trump -- although there was excitement on the far right about DeSantis. The huge power of the Republican base was the secret sauce that forced new House Speaker Kevin McCarthy to make concessions to the most radical representatives in the conference after 15 rounds of voting he needed to win his job. McCarthy had earlier watched as two predecessors, former Speakers John Boehner and Paul Ryan, tried to resist the GOP's far right insurgency and lost their job. As McCarthy showed by handing Fox host Tucker Carlson access to hours of Capitol Hill security footage last week -- despite Carlson's conspiracy theories about January 6, 2021 -- his speakership is a totally owned subsidiary of the GOP's most extreme elements.  McCarthy's dominance by the same GOP base that Murdoch worried about driving away is one reason why a coming showdown with the White House over raising the government's borrowing limit has so many financial experts fretting about a possible default that could rattle the global economy. There are also signs that the power of the Republican grassroots is leading the GOP down a dark and futile road. The party that defeated Soviet Communism now spends its time undermining US democracy. Trump's lies about election fraud -- amplified by Fox and other conservative networks -- delight activists but scare off many moderate and suburban voters, who have contributed to the GOP's loses in key swing states in recent general elections. Following Trump's defeat in 2020, there's a major question whether the no-compromise populism that the base demands can win national elections. The straddle between winning a party's base voters and trying to court middle America has long tested Democratic and Republican nominees when they have to pivot to a general election. In 2024, this political leap may require supreme political skill from whoever emerges from what could be the GOP's ""America First"" primary. What Trump and Murdoch understood and most Republicans didn't Trump's astute political insight in 2016 was to see what no other Republican candidate did -- that his winning coalition was angry and frustrated by years of foreign wars and globalized trade policies that many blamed for sending industrial jobs overseas. These voters were tired of conventional politicians and despised ""elites"" in business, politics and the media who they thought condescended to them. They also balked at political correctness and a wave of social and cultural change, permissive immigration policies and the diverse coalition that secured two terms for President Barack Obama. They wanted to send someone to Washington to break all the rules and to drain what Trump referred to as ""the swamp."" This was why Trump, an apparently unlikely clarion of the people after spending his life in Manhattan and flying around the country on a private Boeing with gold-plated fittings, was the perfect candidate for the moment. He was condemned by liberals for his extreme, racialized and sometimes profane rhetoric. But for his crowds, Trump's early rallies were huge fun -- more like stand-up comedy shows than conventional presidential events. Here was someone who was shouting out loud what millions of Americans had believed for years but felt constrained from saying because of social convention. Many commentators decried Trump's demagoguery but fewer examined the social, economic and political reasons for his rise.  DeSantis in his new book explains the changes in the GOP base that led to Trump and that the Florida governor will seek to harness if he makes a run for president in 2024. ""This persistent theme — that Republicans in Washington fail to effectively represent the values of the people who elect them -- foreshadowed the nomination of Donald Trump in 2016,"" DeSantis writes in ""The Courage to be Free,"" published on Tuesday. ""The chasm between the aspirations of the GOP voter base and the behavior of party leaders in Washington would continue to grow wider in the ensuing years."" DeSantis complains that politicians who go to Washington forget where they come from -- and soon become instruments of a political system that works against their constituents' interests. Yet issues like the need to raise the debt ceiling to keep the government solvent and the economy running or key foreign policy questions, like US support for Ukraine, sometimes require leaders to take a different view of the national interest than prevails back at home. Many politicians face a moment when, for reasons of conscience or political reality, they risk alienating their closest supporters. But sometimes there is no choice but to spend this political capital. The key to Trump's appeal, however, is that he never did. The ex-president's tearing at democratic norms after the election in 2020 was his version of telling voters what they, and he, wanted to hear. He allowed millions of Americans to believe that he had not lost to President Joe Biden and that the election was stained by widespread fraud -- even though there was no basis for his claims. The Fox News opinion hosts who amplified his falsehoods were guilty of exactly the same transgression -- not to protect political careers but apparently to save their lucrative livelihoods.  Trump had foreshadowed this marriage of convenience between his presidency and the conservative media infrastructure in an appearance at the annual Veterans of Foreign Wars convention in Kansas City in 2018. ""Stick with us. Don't believe the crap you see from these people, the fake news. ... What you're seeing and what you're reading is not what's happening,"" he said.","{'neg': 0.113, 'neu': 0.887, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.1027}",59,25.0,0.07716666666666668,0.8300000000000001,0.0928888888888889,0.03593571428571427,0.101,0.781,0.117,0.9785,2.120207142857142,16.167147142857146,139.0,0.1163104110996917
Biden administration embraces tough border measures it once rejected,2023-03-01,"Facing a surge of migrants at the US-Mexico border and on the heels of a crisis, White House and Department of Homeland Security officials began discussing more restrictive policies that would keep migrants from coming to the US.  It was the summer of 2021, just months after a surge of unaccompanied migrant children caught the administration flat-footed and put into sharp focus the immigration challenges ahead for President Joe Biden.  At the time, White House lawyers knocked down one of the ideas: Forcing asylum seekers to find refuge in countries on their way to the US or be turned back. They said it would likely be blocked by the courts, according to two sources familiar with the discussions.  But nearly two years later, the administration announced a policy like the one floated among officials before -- fielding fierce criticism from allies who argued the effort had echoes of the Trump era and crystallizing the shift in Biden's approach to the border, a political vulnerability going into the 2024 presidential election. ""As a matter of good governance, we take all legal considerations into account before putting any policy forward, and the recent proposed rule reflects those considerations,"" an administration official said in a statement. One source close to the White House described the latest policy announcement, which largely bars migrants from seeking asylum in the US if they passed through another country, as ""putting lipstick on a pig.""  The aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic in the Western Hemisphere put the Biden administration in a difficult position from the outset, as migrants began fleeing deteriorating conditions back home in record numbers. Proposals to reform the immigration system fell by the wayside as officials grappled with a record number of migrants arriving at the US southern border, sources told CNN.  But policy ideas, like the new asylum rule, that may have been hard to stomach before are now taking shape as the administration tries to stave off another crisis and Republican attacks.  ""They went from not wanting to do tough stuff to realizing they have no choice,"" one source familiar with discussions told CNN.  CNN reached out to the White House and Department of Homeland Security for comment. Some Biden allies have likened the new asylum rule, which is likely to take effect in May, to a Trump-era policy that sought to bar migrants from seeking asylum at the US-Mexico border.  Biden administration officials have rejected the comparison to the Trump administration, saying that it's not a categorical ban on asylum and emphasizing efforts to expand access to legal pathways to the US, including a recently launched parole program for certain nationalities. ""This was not our first preference or even our second,"" an administration official previously told reporters, stressing efforts to open legal pathways to the US, including use of an app, and underscoring the onus is on Congress to pass reform. The shifting migration patterns -- which have put a strain on federal resources -- have in part prompted the administration to consider new measures, especially as border authorities have encountered an increasing number of Cubans, Venezuelans and Nicaraguans. The US is largely barred from deporting migrants from those nationalities back to their home countries because of strained diplomatic relations.  The US has since begun sending migrants from Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua to Mexico under a Covid-era border restriction, known as Title 42, and opened a separate program that allows migrants of those nationalities and Haiti to apply to legally come to the United States. Thousands of migrants have already applied, and border encounters of those nationalities have dropped significantly.  Immigrant advocates and former Biden officials have slammed the return of migrants to Mexico and the latest policy rollout, calling it a pivot from Biden's pledge to restore asylum. Biden has long promised to take a humane approach to the situation at the border -- a promise that some critics say the current White House could risk breaking with some of their restrictive border policies. ""The original sin was relying on President Trump's Title 42 instead of taking the early hits to get out of it and build legal pathways to relieve pressure off the border,"" said Alida Garcia, vice president of advocacy at FWD.us and a former White House official.  ""Now, we're left with this terrible mess that is only going to increase children crossing on their own and empower cartels,"" Garcia added. The balance of power within the White House over immigration has also changed over the last two years, with progressives largely leaving the administration and people with more moderate positions having more influence. In the first months of the administration, there was often disagreement among moderates and progressives within the administration about how to address migrants at the border, leaving little room for solutions or decisions.  The management of the US southern border not only exposed fractures within the administration but also within Biden's own party about how to address an influx of migrants at the US-Mexico border and a buckling immigration system.   Following last week's announcement, multiple Democratic lawmakers immediately criticized the move to restrict asylum. ""I am deeply outraged by the Biden Administration's proposed ban on asylum seekers,"" said Democratic Rep. Jamaal Bowman of New York in a statement. ""Our immigration policies already fall short in supporting asylum-seekers, but this ban would go further by attacking the very bedrock of our most basic commitment to asylum."" Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas, who has previously been a critic of Biden's management of the border, argued that providing incentives for people to follow a lawful pathway to the US is important to avoid a surge at the border. ""They have shifted. It looks like there's a movement to the middle,"" Cuellar said of the Biden administration. ""I think that's good policy, especially for people at the border."" ""You have to have something in place. You have to have policy in place when Title 42 goes away May 11,"" he added. The administration has repeatedly called on Congress to pass immigration reform, which hasn't happened in decades and has left presidents relying on a patchwork of policies to stem the ongoing flow of migrants.  In the interim, the administration has leaned on Title 42 to turn away certain migrants encountered at the US-Mexico border. With the clock ticking on its expiration in May and amid ongoing litigation, officials are also considering other enforcement measures as tens of thousands of migrants continue to move in the Western Hemisphere. Among the plans being considered by the administration is a fast-track deportation process known as ""expedited removal."" While Mexico has been taking migrants under Title 42 and previously under a Trump-era border policy known as ""remain in Mexico,"" the plan would appear to mark the first time Mexico would take back non-Mexican deportees at a large scale.

House's MAGA wing torn over Trump as loyalists eye other 2024 candidates,2023-03-01,"Former President Donald Trump's allies have been privately lobbying hard-right House members to throw their support behind his bid for the GOP 2024 presidential nomination and help inject some fresh momentum into his fledgling campaign, according to Republican sources.  But Trump has his work cut out for him.  In interviews with roughly two dozen members of the so-called MAGA wing, encompassing some Republicans who were among his staunchest allies during his four years in office, many told CNN they were not yet ready to commit to Trump. Some were keeping their options open as the field develops and others were privately worried that Trump would implode and hand President Joe Biden another four years in office.  And several seem more open to embracing one of Trump's potential opponents, whether it's Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, former Vice President Mike Pence or even former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who won the support of one hard-right House Freedom Caucus member as she announced her bid for the nomination earlier this month.  ""There's a lot of good candidates and I want to take a look at"" them, said Rep. Ken Buck, a Colorado Republican and House Freedom Caucus member who broke with Trump over certifying the 2020 election.  One overriding concern: Whether Trump could actually win in 2024 given that the GOP lost control of the House in 2018 during his tenure, then he lost in 2020 and witnessed the 2022 failure of Republicans to recapture the Senate majority after several Trump-backed candidates collapsed in the general election.  ""Yeah, that's a concern,"" said Rep. Tim Burchett, a conservative Tennessee Republican who is neutral in the race when asked about Trump's performance in the last three cycles. ""A lot of times, our leaders, maybe their morals aren't where we need them to be, but the leadership skills and putting people in place are, so that's kind of what everybody's concerned about.""  The apprehension over Trump inside the Freedom Caucus -- a group that evolved from a conservative policy-centered crew to a Trump fan club over the years -- is emblematic of the broader reservations inside the GOP over Trump's electability. And it underscores the larger challenge that the former president faces to win back his coalition as many GOP officials -- and voters -- are eager to see a fresh face despite their support of his actions in office.   And while there's still plenty of love and respect for Trump on the far right, behind the scenes, there's particular excitement over DeSantis, a founding member of the Freedom Caucus. DeSantis privately met with members of the group earlier this month and held a fundraiser in West Palm Beach, Florida -- Trump's turf -- over the weekend, where several GOP lawmakers were in attendance. ""It's no secret that I was in West Palm this past weekend. I'm pretty impressed with the governor,"" conservative Rep. Chip Roy, a Texas Republican, told CNN. ""I'm going to do what I think is right, based on what is appropriate for the 750,000 people that I represent. That's who I owe my allegiance to -- not any individual, certainly not any politician.""  Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida, a member of the Freedom Caucus, had praise for both DeSantis and Trump but said he would wait to see the field set before taking a position on the candidates.  ""We don't do lockstep politics on our side of the aisle,"" Donalds said. ""So everybody's gonna make a decision of who they want to support early.""  But if DeSantis indeed runs for president, it could benefit Donalds, who told CNN he'd be interested in running for governor of the Sunshine State.  ""Yeah,"" Donalds said when asked if he's open to running for governor.  As Trump eagerly watches to see who endorses him, members of the Freedom Caucus trekked down to Florida over the February congressional recess for a conservative policy conference, where they met with DeSantis.   The governor, who just won a second term last fall, addressed the Freedom Caucus during the conference, and afterward, a number of GOP lawmakers posed for pictures with DeSantis and posted them to social media with glowing captions, raising some eyebrows in GOP circles.  ""It was great for the Freedom Caucus to get to meet him and hear about all the good work he's doing in Florida, that we would love to replicate,"" said Rep. Ben Cline of Virginia, a member of the Freedom Caucus. ""We're blessed with a deep bench. And while Trump is the favorite, I'm watching the field develop.""  Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who credited Trump with helping him win the gavel, has yet to weigh in on the burgeoning presidential primary field. And some GOP lawmakers, including Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, the head of the Freedom Caucus and staunch Trump defender during his time in the White House, refused to answer any questions about the presidential primary.  ""I've got way too many things to worry about, be concerned about, before I get into that,"" Perry told CNN.  Others were similarly mum.  ""That's way above my paygrade,"" said Rep. Dan Bishop, a conservative from North Carolina, when asked about his favorite in the presidential race. ""I'm just an obscure backbencher.""  And at least one prominent Trump backer -- Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina, who once called for using martial law to keep Trump in office -- has already thrown his weight behind Haley, the only other major Republican candidate to officially jump into the race so far.  ""My feelings, at the end of the day, is we have to win the White House in '24 to stop the insanity that's playing out before our very eyes,"" Norman told CNN. ""Nikki has the skills, personal magnetism, fighting spirit, bold decisive, street sense that will excite young, old, independents to go to the polls, and this will be evident over the next 8 to 10 months.""   Asked whether he's worried about possible blowback from Trump, Norman said he had a pleasant phone call with a ""benevolent"" Trump about his endorsement -- and made clear his decision to back Haley was not a personal slight against the former president. But Norman said he hopes other conservative House Republicans will back candidates besides Trump.  ""I hope so, it's called democracy,"" Norman said. ""It's called the political process. When is it bad to get behind a candidate that you believe in?""   Others are torn.   ""There's a lot of people excited about DeSantis. ... And a lot of us have been friends with him for a while, before he even became governor,"" one Freedom Caucus member told CNN, who predicted the governor would rack up some congressional endorsements once he officially gets in the race. ""But we also like Donald Trump. So for a lot of us, it's especially tough.""  To be sure, Trump has his fair share of loyal allies on Capitol Hill. A number of Republicans have already pledged their support to Trump, including Reps. Elise Stefanik of New York, Jim Jordan of Ohio and Lauren Boebert of Colorado. And more are expected to follow suit, especially since Trump has built a lot of goodwill on Capitol Hill through playing in primaries.   ""I'm with Trump out of the gate. I like Ron and several of the other guys too, but I'm with Trump out of the gate,"" said Rep. Clay Higgins of Louisiana.  ""I endorsed him day one. I'm all in,"" added Rep. Ronny Jackson of Texas, a former White House doctor who worked with Trump. Still, the number of congressional endorsements is something that has been on the former president's mind. People involved with Trump's political operation have been whipping lawmakers on Capitol Hill to publicly back Trump, with a particular focus on the Florida members, a senior GOP source told CNN.    ""Trump is very much paying attention to who endorses him,""  the source said. ""Because it matters right now.""   The House Freedom Caucus showed serious signs of splintering earlier this year during the drawn out battle over speaker, with around half the group initially refusing to back McCarthy for the gavel, even though he had Trump's support.  In the end, five House Republicans -- including Rep. Matt Rosendale, who is considering running for Senate in Montana -- voted ""present,"" allowing McCarthy to clinch the speakership. But not before a chaotic episode on the floor, where Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia tried to get Rosendale to talk to Trump on her cell phone.  Rosendale refused -- but insisted it's because he didn't want to break the rules, not because he didn't want to speak to Trump, who endorsed Rosendale in the past.  ""There's rules that prohibit using the phone on the floor,"" he told CNN.  Asked whether he'd back Trump's presidential bid, Rosendale said:  ""I don't do endorsements -- not through primaries.""

Opinion: Who's stopping the government from giving Americans relief from crushing student loans,2023-03-01,"President Joe Biden is trying to give the millions of Americans saddled with student loan debt some relief. Republicans, and the Supreme Court, may not let him.    After Biden took office last year, his administration announced a plan to discharge hundreds of millions of dollars in student loans in a program that would forgive as much as $20,000 per borrower. Biden did this thanks to the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003, or the HEROES Act, which allows the secretary of education to change or get rid of student debt in the context of ""a war or other military operation or national emergency.""    A pandemic is clearly a national emergency, a position former President Donald Trump also took when he paused student debt payments in 2020. Biden expanded upon that, putting loans back into repayment starting in July, but also putting forward a plan to forgive rather than just pause at least some debt.    Many of the more than 43 million Americans saddled with some $1.75 trillion dollars in student debt were thrilled. Many Republicans cried foul.    Six Republican governors and two debt holders filed lawsuits challenging the policy. Their argument is essentially that this program is beyond the scope of Biden's power; he's using Covid as a pretext, they say, for a law that should be approved by Congress. On this point -- and in much of the case -- the Court's conservative justices seemed sympathetic during Tuesday's oral arguments in the two challenges to Biden's plan. The case ""presents extraordinarily serious important issues about the role of Congress,"" Chief Justice John Roberts said, adding, ""We take very seriously the idea of separation of powers and that power should be divided to prevent its abuse.""    He has a point: The US government was indeed set up to separate and balance powers, and to avoid unilateral executive action -- the Founders gave us a president, not a king.    But Congress also gave us the HEROES Act, which explicitly gives the president the authority to cancel student debt in the case of a national emergency. The pandemic was clearly a national emergency. There are often a lot of ""really confusing"" statutes that come before the Court, Justice Elena Kagan said, and ""this is not one."" Clearly, Congress intended for the president to have the power to waive student debt in a national emergency; can it really be the case that the president was given that power, but he's not permitted to use it without Congress weighing in?    The conservative judges seem to say yes.    This is a case that may fall apart before the judges even get to the real meat of it, thanks to standing issues with the plaintiffs. In order for a court to hear a case like this one, the individuals or entities suing have to have suffered some actual harm -- they can't just dislike a law or policy, they have to be negatively affected by it. The Court will first have to consider if the Republican governors who are suing have met the threshold to sue in the first place.    Whatever the outcome, this case will be a political win for the Biden administration. The optics are clear: Democrats want to forgive your student loans; Republicans are willing to go all the way to the Supreme Court to stop them.    If the Republican governors win, though, and the student loan forgiveness program is scrapped, the real losers will be indebted former students, not the GOP.    Student loan debt is crushing, and it has exploded in the last few decades. According to the Education Data Initiative, while the average borrower takes out $30,000 in loans to pay for a bachelor's degree, the average federal debt owed is more than $37,500, and the average private student loan debt is a whopping $54,921.    And all debt is not created equal. Students who take out loans to get, say, business degrees from top universities find themselves in a very different position from students who attend predatory for-profit institutions and wind up with degrees that aren't worth all that much -- if they end up with degrees at all. A great many students who take out student loans don't graduate, leaving them in the worst of all positions: In debt, but with no degree to show for it.    These students -- those who are indebted but don't have a diploma -- are typically vulnerable in many other ways. Borrowers who default on their loans are much more likely than students who graduate to be first-generation college students, to be Black or Hispanic, to have attended a for-profit school, and to have never completed their degree.    While Biden's loan forgiveness plan would benefit many people with student loan debt -- myself included -- it's the borrowers who never graduated or who went to predatory institutions that are currently being hurt the worst, and would see the greatest benefit by having a chunk of their debt knocked off.   Struggling with student debt -- or worse, defaulting and seeing your entire financial life take a huge hit -- is part of what keeps so many Americans living in a state of precarity. Millennials, the oldest of whom are now in our 40s, have been notoriously reluctant to have children, late to marry, and unable to save for homes. Student debt isn't the only driver of these shifts -- much of it is cultural as much as economic -- but beginning your adult life owing tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars does not exactly create a stable foundation on which to build a life.    To add insult to injury, an 18-year-old who spent four years racking up credit card debt buying luxury cars, wearing designer clothes and going on exotic vacations can discharge that debt in bankruptcy. An 18-year-old who signed a $100,000 loan agreement at 7.5% interest because it was their only way to pay for school cannot.    The Biden student loan forgiveness program is far from perfect. It doesn't do nearly enough to ensure that we aren't going to be right back here a few years down the road. It is arguably not generous enough to the most in need and too generous to the white-collar professionals who can afford to pay off their loans. And liberals should have real concerns about executive overreach.    But we should be concerned about overreach from a conservative Supreme Court, too, as well as a student loan system that places heavy financial burdens on young people as soon as they embark on their adult lives.    The Republican talking point on this case is that Biden's plan is a massive taxpayer giveaway, and that he cunningly used Covid as an excuse to push through a policy Congress would have never approved. So it's worth asking Republican politicians: Why won't Congress act to relieve student loan debt — even if it means making the uber-wealthy and large corporations pay more in taxes — and improve the economic and personal futures of so many young people?   The GOP opposes Biden's student debt relief plan, and members of the party are so against it that they're willing to take it all the way to the Supreme Court. Voters like me, who still carry significant student debt that has very much impacted my financial wellbeing and curtailed my ability to save for little things like ever being able to retire, want answers from the GOP: If you're willing to fight student loan forgiveness in front of the Supreme Court, why aren't you willing to fight for the millions of Americans who are being crushed by the debt we needed to take on to get our degrees?","{'neg': 0.22, 'neu': 0.484, 'pos': 0.296, 'compound': 0.34}",45,28.0,0.128,0.788,0.084,-0.3182,0.141,0.721,0.138,0.5603,-14.318999999999999,9.710853809523808,236.0,0.04114768563357546
The fastest growing metro in the US is looking to a shrinking reservoir to keep the boom going,2023-02-28,"In a bright-red county in a state allergic to regulations, there is a ban on growing grass outside new businesses. Only 8% of a home's landscaping can have a grass lawn in this booming corner of Utah, about a hundred miles northeast of Las Vegas.  And if any developers want to add another country club to this golfing mecca, ""I don't know where they would get the water from,"" said Zach Renstrom, general manager of the Washington County Water Conservancy District. ""And I'm telling you, I know where every drop of water is."" Like lots of spots in the West, the combination of more people and less water makes for an uncertain future around St. George, Utah. While this winter's generous snowpack could buy precious time, the entire Colorado River system remains in danger of crashing if water gets too low at Lakes Powell and Mead. But that reality hasn't stopped St. George from booming into the fastest growing metro area in the US two years running, according to the US Census Bureau, and Renstrom says that unless Utah builds a long-promised pipeline to pump water 140 miles from Lake Powell, their growth will turn to pain. In the meantime, Lake Powell -- the country's second-largest reservoir -- has struggled to serve even the places it currently provides water to. Last week it sank to the lowest water level since the reservoir was filled in the 1960s, and since 2000 has lost more than 150 feet. ""If we stop construction water, that act alone would lay off about 20% of our county,"" Renstrom said. ""We've made a commitment that we're going to make sure to be good stewards of every single drop of water that's already here and make sure we're utilizing that. But when we look at our long-term growth and you know how much water we need, (the Lake Powell Pipeline) is still in our long-term plan.""

Washington County said it consumed about 50,000 acre feet of water in 2022, all of it supplied by the Virgin River which flows into the Colorado system and out of taps from Vegas to LA. An acre-foot is the amount of water needed to cover one acre to the depth of one foot -- roughly 326,000 gallons. A plan to pump 80,000 acre feet of water a year from Lake Powell to Sand Hollow Reservoir passed the Utah legislature in 2006 and met immediate opposition from environmental groups worried about fragile desert ecosystems. Fourteen dry years later in 2020, the Trump administration tried to fast-track the project's environmental review but water managers from the other six Colorado River Basin states banded together to block it. ""The system is crashing and to be honest, it's kind of incomprehensible to think of a diversion of that size that would serve 200,000 people in one county in southern Utah at this moment in time. There's just not the water,"" Matt Rice, Southwest Region Director of the nonprofit American Rivers told CNN. ""We're worried about every molecule of water that that we can deliver to Lake Powell and Lake Mead to protect critical hydroelectric infrastructure."" While in legal limbo, the controversy brought fresh headlines in January when the mayor of the small Washington County town of Ivins called it ""the Lake Powell pipe dream"" during a public meeting. ""Shame on me,"" Ivins Mayor Chris Hart laughed about his words as he welcomed CNN to Ivins, proudly pointing out the irrigation-free desert xeriscape around the new city hall.  ""The motivation for that comment is that this project has faced a lot of obstacles and continues to with the shortage impacting all of the basin states,"" Hart explained. ""There are groups who believe that we can that we can work our way out of it through conservation and other ways. The studies show us that eventually the Lake Powell pipeline will be necessary for us to continue to develop in the county. So, I actually used that word tongue-in-cheek, because the serious side of it is that it is an essential part of our plan."" Hart also said it's Utah's turn to grow, after the growth in California, Arizona and Nevada. ""They've had their enormous growth spurts through the years and the water has been made available for them to do that. And now here we are,"" he said. ""I think our perspective, from the state of Utah, is we're entitled to that, to our share, whatever that is,"" he said. Hart and Renstrom are evangelists for water conservation in a county allergic to rules and regulations and where 74% voted for Donald Trump in 2020. ""We're a red state and in Utah, this is a red county. And so we like our independence, we like our freedoms,"" Renstrom said. ""If I step in and say, 'I just want more government regulations,' it's immediately dead."" But Renstrom has managed to help pass some of the strictest water laws in the West. ""It is causing a lot of friction,"" he said, ""Because we're asking people that have had a certain type of lifestyle or a certain way of living and asking them to radically change that, to make sure that we have additional water for our economy. And it's hard."" Rice at American Rivers says a shift in mindset — especially among Eastern transplants ignorant to living with drought — is vital to future desert survival. Instead of focusing on the pipeline, he hopes desert leaders like Mayor Hart will tap into the unprecedented federal funding for water reclamation projects in both the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act.  ""There's about $12 billion that could be deployed in the Colorado River Basin not only for municipal needs but agricultural needs and watershed restoration,"" he said. Hart acknowledged that item is on the wish list.  ""One thing that we haven't done a lot of here that Vegas have become masters at is to recapture the water that flows through our buildings and run it through a treatment plant and then recycle it,"" Hart said. ""So the few drops of rain that we get, if we can use them four or five times, that's a whole different thing than the drop of rain comes, you use it and off it goes down the river and it's gone.""","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.904, 'pos': 0.096, 'compound': 0.1779}",42,29.0,0.0985,0.9015,0.0,-0.44435,0.057,0.847,0.096,0.9921,-18.6627,-7.094146190476193,252.0,-0.028151373771730926
Biden administration tells student loan forgiveness applicants it is 'confident' in face of Supreme Court skepticism,2023-02-28,"The Biden administration is projecting confidence about the fate of President Joe Biden's student loan cancellation program in a message to applicants, even in the face of skepticism from conservative Supreme Court justices in Tuesday's high-stakes oral arguments.  Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said in an email sent to millions of borrowers who applied for debt cancellation that the administration ""mounted a powerful case"" in support of Biden's executive action.  ""Our Administration is confident in our legal authority to adopt this plan, and today made clear that opponents of the program lack standing to even bring their case to court,"" Cardona wrote in the email update obtained by CNN. The email update to applicants reflects a position administration officials have maintained in the wake of the oral arguments. But it also implicitly lays out the administration's view of the political dynamics of a move that has became an immediate partisan flashpoint.  As applicants and administration officials alike settle in for what will likely be months of waiting for a final decision, the update sent to roughly 7 million people also provides a window into the reach the administration would have to frame the debate -- and consequences -- should the program be struck down.  Cardona's message comes as millions of borrowers remain in limbo as they await a Supreme Court decision on whether Biden's action to cancel up to $20,000 in student loan debt will stand.   White House officials, who closely monitored the oral arguments in two challenges, have maintained the position that they will ultimately prevail in the cases that challenge Biden's authority to discharge millions of dollars in federally held loans. While they remain confident on the merits, sources continue to highlight the view inside the administration that the plaintiffs lack standing to bring the challenges -- which would render the arguments over the authority itself moot.  One source familiar told CNN that the White House remains confident that things will go their way, simply saying: ""We'll win."" A particular flashpoint in the hearing was the states' arguments that the loan forgiveness program's potential harms to MOHELA -- the Missouri-created entity that services loans in the state -- gives Missouri standing. Justice Amy Coney Barrett stood out among the conservatives for asking particularly pointed questions of the GOP states about their standing arguments, setting her apart as a potential pickup vote for the court's three liberal members. ""If MOHELA is an arm of the state, why didn't you just strong-arm MOHELA and say you've got to pursue this suit,"" Barrett asked Nebraska Solicitor General James Campbell.  The question was one of several directed at Campbell, who represented the group of Republican-led states that argue the administration exceeded its authority, about the states' standing claims. Another source familiar said that Barrett's comments only raised optimism within the administration.  But as several conservative justices leveled sharp questions related the government's authority on the matter, Cardona's update appeared intended to assuage overarching concerns.   It also previewed a political contrast officials will likely elevate should Supreme Court strike down Biden's actions -- one White House officials have repeatedly pressed as the challenges have made their way through the courts.  ""While opponents of this program would deny relief to tens of millions of working- and middle-class Americans, we are fighting to deliver relief to borrowers who need support as they get back on their feet after the economic crisis caused by the pandemic,"" Cardona wrote.  Biden's plan would cancel as much as $10,000 in federal student loan debt for people earning less than $125,000 a year, or less than $250,000 for married couples. Individuals on Pell Grants could see up to $20,000 forgiven. In all, more than 40 million federal borrowers would qualify for some level of debt cancelation, with roughly 20 million who would have their balance forgiven entirely.  The Biden administration received 26 million applications for the program, which has been frozen as the court battles have played out, and more than 16 million applications had already been approved.  Cardona reiterated that a pause on federal loan payments, which was implemented during the Trump administration in response to the pandemic and was set to restart at the same time cancellation was implemented, remain on hold as the Supreme Court deliberations play out.  ""While we await the Supreme Court's decision, the pause on student loan payments remains in effect,"" Cardona wrote. ""Payments will resume 60 days after the Supreme Court announces its decision.""  If the litigation is not resolved by June 30, payments are scheduled to resume 60 days after that date. If it has not made a decision or resolved the litigation by June 30, payments will resume 60 days after that. The Supreme Court's decision is expected to come this summer.","{'neg': 0.097, 'neu': 0.628, 'pos': 0.275, 'compound': 0.5719}",28,30.0,0.0,0.87,0.13,0.7184,0.084,0.78,0.136,0.9921,20.1152,10.900846666666666,221.0,0.049325098039215684
Supreme Court considers fate of Biden's student loan relief plan,2023-02-24,"The Supreme Court heard oral arguments Tuesday in two challenges to President Joe Biden’s student debt relief plan, with several conservative justices appearing skeptical of the government’s authority to discharge millions of dollars in federally held loans. If the conservatives do ultimately rule in favor of the policy’s challengers, the hearing made clear they will have to grapple with the legal questions around why states and individual borrowers should be allowed to sue over the program – questions that emerged as a flash point during the arguments. Millions of qualifying student loan borrowers could see up to $20,000 of their debt canceled depending on the outcome of the arguments. How and when the justices rule will also determine when payments on federal student loans will resume after a pandemic-related pause was put in place nearly three years ago. In Biden v. Nebraska, a group of Republican-led states argued the administration exceeded its authority by using the pandemic as a pretext to mask the true goal of fulfilling a campaign promise to erase student-loan debt. The second case is Department of Education v. Brown, which was initially brought by two individuals who did not qualify for the program and argue the government failed to follow proper rulemaking process when putting it in place. Here are some takeaways from the oral arguments: Conservatives see this case as another chance to rein in aggressive actions by Biden: In the questions the conservative justices posed, they signaled that they see the GOP states’ case as presenting the court with another chance to draw the lines around when the executive branch can and cannot act without Congress. Several of the exchanges concerned the application of the so-called “Major Questions Doctrine,” a legal theory embraced by the court’s Republican appointees that says Congress can be expected to speak with specificity when it gives an agency power to do something of great political or economic significance. The states are arguing that under the doctrine, the Biden student debt program should be blocked. Chief Justice John Roberts said to US Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar that the case “presents extraordinarily serious important issues about the role of Congress.” Justice Brett Kavanaugh asked Prelogar to compare the dispute to cases in the court’s history where the court ultimately pushed back against government claims that a national emergency justified the aggressive, unilateral action by the executive branch. And Justice Neil Gorsuch asked Nebraska Solicitor General James Campbell, who is representing the red states, a series a questions that seemed aimed at helping the court further flesh out the doctrine. Lawyer for GOP state gets grilled on standing: Whether the GOP states are threatened by the type of harm that makes it appropriate for a court to intervene was a major theme. Nebraska Solicitor General James Campbell received a series of questions – from justices on both sides of the ideological spectrum – about whether the states had overcome this procedural threshold, which is known as “standing.” A particular flashpoint in the hearing was the states’ arguments that the loan forgiveness program’s potential harms to MOHELA – the Missouri-created entity that services loans in the state – gives Missouri standing. Several justices noted that MOHELA could have filed its own lawsuit challenging the program, but has not. Barrett may be a justice to watch: Justice Amy Coney Barrett has stood out among the conservatives for asking particularly pointed questions of the GOP states about their standing arguments, setting her apart as a potential pick up vote for the court’s three liberal members. “If MOHELA is an arm of the state, why didn’t you just strong-arm MOHELA and say you’ve got to pursue this suit,” Barrett asked Campbell, among several questions she asked him about the states’ standing claims. Even if Barrett swings to the liberals to vote that the lawsuit should be rejected because of the standing concerns, the Biden administration will need the vote of one more GOP-appointed justice. Sotomayor raises the practical stakes of the case: In extended remarks to Campbell, Justice Sonia Sotomayor laid out the practical implications of the case in stark terms. “There’s 50 million students who are – who will benefit from this. Who today will struggle. Many of them don’t have assets sufficient to bail them out after the pandemic. They don’t have friends or families or others who can help them make these payments,” she remarked. Those debtors will suffer in ways others won’t because of the pandemic, she said. “And what you’re saying is now we’re going to give judges the right to decide how much aid to give them instead of the person with the expertise and the experience the secretary of Education who’s been dealing with educational issues and the problems surrounding student loans,” she said. Read more takeaways here.  ##Catch Up## President Joe Biden’s plan to forgive up to $20,000 of student loans for some people is on pause as challenges make their way through the court system — but experts say there is a college affordability problem that needs to be addressed. Mamie Voight, the president and CEO of the Institute for Higher Education Policy, said states have an important role in accomplishing this. States need to invest “really heavily in their public institutions to keep those tuition costs low for students” and minimize the need to borrow. One example, she said, is states' ability to direct grant aid and help students, particularly from low-income backgrounds, cover both the cost of tuition and the cost of living. When students are deciding where to go to college and how to pay for it, the idea is that “they’re able to piece together investments from the federal government through the Pell Grant, hopefully relatively low tuition costs because of state investment in public higher education and grants and scholarships from the institutions that are directed to students who really couldn't afford to go to college without that financial support,” Voight said. If the affordability issue isn't solved, higher education and the opportunity for economic mobility, won’t be attainable for many people, Voight said. “It’s really incumbent upon policy maker at the federal, state and institution level to really address these challenges” both in the short-term and the long-term, she said, stressing that idea of a shared partnership. Elizabeth Shermer, a historian and associate professor at Loyola University Chicago, said she agrees with the importance of state involvement. “It always comes from the local and state up to the federal, that's how it’s always worked,” she said. The way forward, in her opinion, is legislation that connects states and the federal government together on the issue by creating high-quality, tuition-free options for students to put pressure on four-year institutions to lower their tuition prices. She said she supports the proposed College for All Act, introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, that would do this. Alternatively, offering two free years of community college would also accomplish that same competition she believes is necessary for long-term change. The Supreme Court finished hearing oral arguments in two cases challenging President Joe Biden's student loan forgiveness program. What may happen next: Under normal circumstances, a case with such high political stakes would likely be resolved in late June or early July. But because the justices expedited the briefing, there is a possibility they may prioritize the opinion and release it before the end of the term. If the Supreme Court rules that the Biden administration’s student loan forgiveness program is legal and allows it to move forward — or if the court dismisses the challenges due to a lack of “standing,” or the legal right to bring the disputes in the first place — it’s possible the government will begin issuing some debt cancellations fairly quickly. If the court strikes down the program, it could be possible for the administration to make some modifications to the policy and try again – though that process could take months. US Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar is now at the podium again to deliver her rebuttal and closing arguments.  During today's hearing, Prelogar has argued that the administration has the clear legal authority to provide relief to borrowers in order to protect them from the financial harms brought on by the pandemic, such as the inability to buy food or make rent or mortgage payments. She stressed that the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003 —known as the HEROES ACT— provides the legal authority for the relief. She will also say that the states do not have the sufficient injury necessary to bring the claim in the first place. Prelogar told the Supreme Court that it should not be thinking about the political debate over student debt that predated the pandemic when the justices consider whether Biden's forgiveness program is lawful. ##Arguments##  The court's liberals pushed back on how conservative justices had focused on whether the Biden student debt relief program was fair to all borrowers. The issue is key to the case the court is hearing now, because the challengers -- two borrowers -- claim they were unlawfully deprived of a notice-and-comment period to argue to the agency that the program wasn't fair to them. ""I think the bottom-line answer to be, everybody suffered in the pandemic. But different people got different benefits because they qualified under different programs, correct?"" Justice Sonia Sotomayor noted to US Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar.  Sotomayor: There is an ""inherent unfairness in society because we're not a society of unlimited resources."" Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson echoed that point, telling Prelogar, ""I'm wondering whether or not the same fairness issue would arise with respect to any federal benefit programs."" Attorney J. Michael Connolly is now taking the podium on behalf of two student borrowers — Myra Brown and Alexander Taylor.  Connolly works for the boutique law firm Consovoy McCarthy, which also represented former President Donald Trump in some of his legal battles.  Connolly is likely to repeat what he said in briefs, that the HEROES Act “does not authorize the Secretary to cancel nearly half-a-trillion dollars in debts held by tens of millions of individuals."" This case may not go as long as the first because so many of the issues are the same. Prelogar is then expected return to end the marathon session. What happens next: Under normal circumstances, a case with such high political stakes would likely be resolved in late June or early July. But because the justices expedited the briefing, there is a possibility they may prioritize the opinion and release it before the end of the term. US Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar told the Supreme Court that it should not be thinking about the political debate over student debt that predated the pandemic when the justices consider whether Biden's forgiveness program is lawful. She was responding to a question from Justice Brett Kavanaugh. He noted that student debt relief was ""something on the table,"" that was being ""discussed' and ""debated"" before it became part of the government's response to the Covid-19. Prelogar discouraged the justices from taking those political dynamics into account in their ruling on the scope of the HEROES Act, the law that the Biden administration says gives it the authority to enact the program. She told Kavanaugh to put himself in the shoes of the 2003 Congress hat passed that law. She argued that those lawmakers couldn't have anticipated whether or not debt relief was the subject of political debate when a national emergency in the form a pandemic hit. She said that if the court lets those political dynamics affect its ruling, it will have ""disabled"" Congress' ability to pass laws to ensure that the executive branch can respond quickly to emergency. ##Arguments## The conservative justices have peppered US Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar with questions about why President Joe Biden's proposed student loan forgiveness program is fair in respect to people who won't benefit — those who have already paid off their student debt or never took out student loans to begin with, for example. After justices, including Chief Justice John Roberts, asked several times about the fairness of the program, Justice Samuel Alito posed the question again. ""Why was it fair to the people who didn't get arguably comparable relief, not maybe that their interests were outweighed by the interests of those who were benefited or they were somehow less deserving of solicitude,"" Alito asked. ""My answer to that question is that Congress has already made the judgment that when there is a national emergency that affects borrowers in this way, the secretary can provide relief,"" Prelogar said.  She pointed to language in the HEROES Act that says the education secretary can waive or modify federal student loan programs to ensure that borrowers ""are not placed in a worse position financially in relation to that financial assistance."" ##Arguments## US Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar argued that the two plaintiffs – student loan borrowers Myra Brown and Alexander Taylor — don't have the legal right, or ""standing,"" to bring the case.  Under President Joe Biden's proposed student loan forgiveness program, neither plaintiff would qualify for the maximum amount of debt relief. Brown doesn't qualify at all because her loans are privately held and Taylor is only eligible for up to $10,000 of debt relief — not up to $20,000 — because he did not receive a Pell grant while enrolled in college. ""They claim to want greater loan forgiveness than the plan provides. But they asked this court to hold that the HEROES Act doesn't authorize loan forgiveness at all,"" Prelogar said.  If the Biden program is struck down, not only would the plaintiffs get no relief at all, but no one else would either.  ""Parties cannot go to court to make themselves and everyone else worse off,"" Prelogar said.  ##Arguments## The key legal question in the cases before the Supreme Court on Tuesday is whether the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003, known as the HEROES Act, grants the executive branch an emergency power to implement President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness program. The HEROES Act, which was passed in the wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, grants the secretary of education the power to “waive or modify” a federal student loan program in order to ensure that individuals “are not placed in a worse position financially” because of “a war or other military operation or national emergency.” Lawyers for the Biden administration argue that this provision gives the secretary of education the authority to cancel federal student loan debt so that borrowers are not made worse off with respect to their loans by the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. They cite data that shows borrowers who previously had their payments paused due to an emergency like a hurricane were at a higher risk of default after the pause expired. But plaintiffs argue the Biden administration is abusing its power and using the pandemic as a pretext for fulfilling the president’s campaign pledge to cancel student debt. Even before ruling on the merits of the cases, the justices must consider whether the suing parties have standing to bring the legal challenges. This means that the parties must show that they have the legal injury necessary to be able to bring the challenge. Last year, a district court found that the states did not have standing to sue. The states appealed to the 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals, which granted their request for a preliminary injunction. If the justices decide that none of the parties have standing, the cases will be dismissed and Biden’s program will be allowed to move forward. The Supreme Court has now moved on to hear arguments in the second case challenging President Joe Biden's student loan forgiveness program.  It just finished hearing arguments from a case brought by six states. The second case was initially brought by two student borrowers. US Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar is back at the podium. She is expected to say that the students – Myra Brown and Alexander Taylor — like the states, don’t have the legal right to bring the case. She is likely to emphasize that the borrowers didn’t qualify for full relief in the first place, so they won’t be injured if the plan goes into effect. Justice Brett Kavanaugh sought some context on how the court should see the current dispute over student debt relief fitting within the larger spectrum of other cases dealing with  executive branch actions aimed at the Covid-19 pandemic. Kavanaugh referenced the court rulings that blocked Biden's eviction moratorium and the Covid-19 vaccine mandate requirement for certain businesses. But he also noted the Biden administration vaccine mandate for some health care facilities. Kavanaugh told Nebraska Solicitor General James A. Campbell that one of the key distinctions in the health care vaccine mandate cases is that the policy was in the ""wheelhouse"" of the CDC, the agency that implemented it. He asked the Nebraska solicitor general to weigh in on the argument by the DOJ and others that loan forgiveness is also in the ""wheelhouse"" of the Education Department, distinguishing it from the cases where the court ruled against Biden Covid-19 policies. Campbell said that the loan forgiveness policy was not in the Education Department's wheelhouse because it required the secretary to make a brand new cancellation program. ##Arguments## US Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar is now offering a rebuttal in the first case challenging the Biden administration's plan to forgive student loans. Nebraska's Solicitor General James A. Campbell was just at the podium arguing on behalf of the six Republican-led states that say they would be harmed financially if the forgiveness program goes into effect. Prelogar has been arguing that the Department of Education has the authority to implement debt cancellation. After this, the court is expected to hear arguments in the second case brought by two borrowers who don’t fully qualify for debt forgiveness under the program. The justices have spent a considerable amount of time on Tuesday quizzing an attorney for the red states on why a student loan servicer created by Missouri didn’t bring the lawsuit before the court. “Usually, we don't allow one person to step into another's shoes and say, ‘I think that that person suffered harm,’ even if the harm is very great,” Justice Elena Kagan said to Nebraska Solicitor General James A. Campbell. “So why isn't MOHELA responsible for deciding whether to bring this suit?” Justice Amy Coney Barrett piled on later, asking Campbell: “If Mohela is an arm of the state, why didn't you just strong-arm MOHELA and say you've got to pursue this suit?” The questions dig at the core of the Biden administration’s argument: that the states lack the legal right known as “standing” to challenge the debt relief program and that instead, the Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority (MOHELA) should have sued, since the servicer would have easily cleared the standing threshold.  A federal appeals court previously focused on one of the states behind the challenge, Missouri, and pointed to MOHELA, which has contracted with the federal Department of Education to service student loans. The court said that because MOHELA will stop receiving servicing fees for loans discharged under the new plan, it won’t be able to fulfill its obligation to contribute a specified amount of money to the state treasury. The appeals court ruled MOHELA is akin to a state entity and therefore said that it satisfied the standing requirement. Critics of that theory say that MOHELA was established with financial and legal independence from the state of Missouri and the vast amount of its funds are segregated from state funds. They believe that for the purpose of the lawsuit, MOHELA cannot be considered an “arm of the state.” White House officials on Tuesday are closely monitoring oral arguments that are getting underway before the Supreme Court, keenly aware that what happens today inside the nation’s highest court will determine the fate of a major policy priority for President Joe Biden – canceling student loan debt. The White House has expressed confidence it will prevail. One of the main reasons comes down to standing, the source said, arguing that the burden is currently on the six Republican-led states and two borrowers in Texas — who have brought two cases against the administration — to prove that they have the legal authority to challenge the proposed program. Last year, a district court found that the states did not have standing to sue. Biden announced last year a federal student loan forgiveness program that would forgive up to $20,000 in debt for some borrowers. The legal challenges have left many borrowers stuck in limbo. The Supreme Court’s decision on the matter is not expected until this summer. Justice Elena Kagan expressed skepticism about the states' argument that the HEROES Act doesn't clearly give the education secretary the authority to cancel federal student debt in the case of an emergency.  ""Congress used its voice,"" Kagan said.
""All this business about executive power, I mean, we worry about executive power when Congress hasn't authorized the use of executive power. Here, Congress has authorized the use of executive power in an emergency situation,"" she added.  Kagan stressed that she believes that Congress made the statute very clear in this respect.  ""Congress doesn't get much clearer than that. And we deal with congressional statutes every day that are really confusing. This one is not,"" she added.  As the nine justices hear oral arguments inside the Supreme Court, CNN spoke to people outside the building rallying for President Joe Biden's plan for student loan debt forgiveness . Here's what some of them said:  Destiny Perry, a first-generation college student at Morgan State University in Baltimore, lives in a single-parent household of five. “Right now, I have taken out a lot of loans. ... I'm out here trying to just go through college without having to stress about all the payments and everything else,” Perry said. Perry said she explores scholarship opportunities to offset the debt, but she knows it will not be enough to graduate debt-free.  Glen Lopez, a freshman at Morgan State, described his student debt as a ""creeping feeling."" He said that he thinks about the debt ""every two to three days.""  Rep. Ayanna Pressley told CNN she knows about student debt from a personal perspective. ""Well, what I was sharing is a story that is certainly no anomaly. This is a systemic crisis – a nearly $2 trillion crisis burning people from every walk of life,” the Massachusetts Democrat said.  “Like those millions of Black borrowers – and I was growing up in single-parent household — and given financial strain, I had no choice but to take out those loans. I ultimately defaulted on those loans and I did pay off those loans, but it took me 20 plus years to do so. And I was gainfully employed and often living check to check and I simply could just not make ends meet. I just could not get ahead,” she said. In response to opponents’ arguments that people should pay the loans they take out, Pressley said that “hardship is not a character flaw."" ""And despite people's Herculean efforts working multiple jobs, given rising costs, people are treading water. They're treading water, and we can do something to alleviate this burden and this hardship,” she said.  Natalia Abrams, president and founder of the Student Debt Crisis Center, said she did not imagine the movement for student debt forgiveness getting this far. “Over a decade ago, when we started this organization, we were lucky to just have Senator [Elizabeth] Warren fighting for us. We had one senator and were so happy. I never would have imagined 10 years later we’d be on the steps of the Supreme Court and having the President of the United States fight for student loan borrowers,” she told CNN.  ##Reactions## Nebraska Solicitor General James Campbell, who is representing all the GOP states suing over the debt relief program, received tough questions from several justices about whether the states have really proved that they would be harmed by the loan forgiveness program in a way that would warrant a court intervention.  That line of questions included a grilling from Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who zeroed in on how MOHELA — the Missouri-created entity that services loans in the state and which Missouri is pointed to as giving it standing  — could have opted to challenge in court the debt relief policy but hasn't. ""If MOHELA is an arm of the state, why didn't you just strong-arm MOHELA and say you've got to pursue this suit,"" Barrett asked Campbell. He said that was a matter of state politics and Justice Elena Kagan jumped in to note that even to get records from MOHELA, Missouri has to use a state open records law. Before Barrett's inquiries, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson also pressed Campbell on whether the supposed harms the loan forgiveness program was causing MOHELA really established standing for Missouri, as did Kagan, who highlighted MOHELA's absence from the lawsuit. ##Arguments## A case concerning a moratorium that had been placed on evictions during the Covid-19 pandemic keeps coming up in Tuesday's student debt relief policy arguments.  US Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar tried to draw a distinction between the two cases while answering a series of questions from Justice Brett Kavanaugh. She said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention eviction case brought up concerns of an agency acting ""outside the core of its domain,"" but that is not what is happening with the Department of Education. ""This is the student loan program. That falls within the wheelhouse of the Secretary of Education. He exercises comprehensive authority over that program. These are federal loans between the federal government and student loan borrowers, so this is a situation where the secretary is really acting within the core of his expertise and his authority,"" Prelogar said. Those challenging the student debt forgiveness say there are parallels between the two cases, while the Biden administration argues the disputes are distinct.  The eviction moratorium case did not even get a full hearing before the Supreme Court. What has been cited by President Joe Biden’s foes is a per curium order — an unsigned order from the Supreme Court that blocked the CDC policy that tenants could not get evicted while the moratorium was in place. The case was seen as a forerunner to the Supreme Court’s full-scale endorsement — in a case handed down in June — of the so-called major questions doctrine, which says that if Congress is going to give the agency the power to make policy on a matter of significant political or economic consequence, lawmakers can be expected to say so with specificity in the laws that they pass.  “If a federally imposed eviction moratorium is to continue, Congress must specifically authorize it,” the court said in the August 2021 order. The liberals on the court at the time dissented. Opponents of the student debt program say that Tuesday’s case arises in similar circumstances as the eviction moratorium dispute: an executive branch agency allegedly using the pandemic as a pretext to go beyond the authority that Congress has given it to enact a major policy change.  Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson gave US Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar the opportunity to stress how a ruling that said the states had standing in this case could hamper the federal government's ability to operate. ""I guess I'm concerned that we're going to have a problem in terms of the federal government's ability to operate,"" the justice said. ""So my question is, is this a legitimate concern and should we be thinking in cases like this, about that type of concern as we ponder whether to expand our standing doctrines?"" Prelogar agreed that it was a ""legitimate concern."" She noted that past things the court has said about standing and how ""the judiciary doesn't sit as a roving commission to rule on the legality of either Congress's enactments or the executive's implementation of those enactments."" ##Arguments## Justice Brett Kavanaugh, in comments to US Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, suggested he saw the student debt case existing in a history of the court deciding whether it would defer to an executive branch claim that a national emergency warranted aggressive unilateral action. The Biden administration is arguing that the national emergency presented by the Covid-19 pandemic — and the economic disruption the pandemic wrought — justified the education secretary canceling the student loans of certain debtors. ""Some of the biggest mistakes in the court's history were deferring to assertions of executive or emergency power,"" Kavanaugh said. ""Some of the finest moments in the court's history were pushing back against presidential assertions of emergency power, and that's continued not just in the Korean War, but post-9/11, in some of the cases there."" He asked Prelogar to explain to the court ""how we should think about our role in assertion of presidential emergency power, given the court's history. "" Prelogar returned to a theme that she has brought up repeatedly in Tuesday's arguments: that there is distinction between an executive action that regulates people's conduct versus an action that deals with the doling out of government benefits. ##Arguments## Justice Clarence Thomas questioned US Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar about the distinction between the Biden administration's student loan debt forgiveness program and grants that Congress needs to appropriate.  ""There's some discussion in the briefs .... that this is in effect a cancellation of a debt, that's really what we're talking about, and that as a cancellation of $400 billion in debt, in effect this is a grant of $400 billion and it runs headlong into Congress' appropriations authority,"" Thomas said. Prelogar said that implementing the debt relief program doesn't require that any money be drawn from the Treasury, so it doesn't strictly raise an appropriations issue. She also said while loan forgiveness would ""of course"" result in cancellation of a measure of debt for borrowers, she doesn't ""think that that is materially different from the kind of effects you can see from other types of authority that's long been exercised under the HEROES Act."" Thomas said he didn't think she fully explained why you could not argue that the education secretary could just grant $400 billion — which would require appropriations from Congress. ""The argument is that you are in effect doing that without appropriations from Congress,"" Thomas said. Prelogar gave an example of relief in periods of extended deferment for soldiers fighting abroad, in which the government has paid interest on loans.  ""That's exactly what Congress intended under this authority; it's to make those changes to the program in direct response to and in direct proportion to the situation the secretary confronts that will otherwise leave that borrower worse off,"" she said.   ##Arguments## Nebraska’s Solicitor General James A. Campbell is now speaking at the podium before the nine justices after US solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar wrapped her arguments on behalf of the Biden administration.  Campbell is representing the six states that say they would be harmed financially if President Joe Biden's student loan forgiveness program goes into effect. He is expected to offer several theories to explain why the states will be injured by the plan. Most of his theories revolve around the potential of lost tax revenue. He's also expected to stress that the plan amounts to an unlawful attempt to erase an estimated $430 billion of federal student loan debt under the guise of the pandemic. Chief Justice John Roberts made clear that he saw the student debt forgiveness as an important opportunity for the court to further flesh out its ""Major Questions Doctrine.""  ""We take very seriously the idea of separation of powers and that power should be divided to prevent its abuse,"" Roberts told US Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar. He said that the case reminded him of a decision from the Trump administration where the court blocked Trump's efforts to end the ""Dreamers"" program for young undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as minors. ""I just wonder, given the posture of the case and given our historic concern about the separation of powers, you would recognize at least that this is a case that presents extraordinarily serious important issues about the role of Congress and about the role that we should exercise in scrutinizing that, significant enough that the Major Questions Doctrine ought to be considered implicated?"" Roberts said. Remember: Under the “Major Questions Doctrine,"" if an agency acts in a way that could have major political or economic implications, it must have the authority of Congress. The states are saying here that essentially, the college debt relief plan is too big for the Biden administration to use the authority in its citing. ##Arguments## Justice Neil Gorsuch asked whether the Biden administration considered the cost to people who are not eligible for the proposed student loan forgiveness program because they don't have student loans.  The plaintiffs said that missing from the government's analysis, Gorsuch said, is the ""cost to other persons in terms of fairness, for example, people who've paid their loans... and people who are not eligible for loans in the first place."" More context: Americans who did not go to college or already paid off their student loans won’t see a direct benefit from Biden’s program, which the Congressional Budget Office has estimated will cost $400 billion over time. Also, a one-time cancellation of federal student loan debt does nothing to bring down the cost of college for future borrowers. About 81% of households who earn less than $125,000 a year don’t have student loan debt, according to an analysis done last year by Matthew Chingos, vice president of education data and policy at the Urban Institute. He based the estimation on the 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances conducted by the Federal Reserve. ##Arguments## Justice Neil Gorsuch brought up the court's decision in 2019 that blocked former President Donald Trump's plans to add a citizenship question to the census. Chief Justice John Roberts joined the court's then-four liberals to rule in favor of the question's challengers and that ruling is one of the cases that the opponents to student debt relief are citing to back their standing arguments. Gorsuch noted Tuesday that the court said in the census case, that the potential undercount of the citizenship question would cause New York established standing for New York to bring that case, because an undercount would have cost New York federal funding and a loss in other benefits. ""That kind of knock-on effect was sufficient to constitute standing in that case, and I just like to get your thoughts on how you'd have us distinguish that?"" Gorsuch asked. Prelogar said that in the census case the injury that would have been caused by an undercount was more direct, and that in the student debt case, the financial injuries the states were claiming were ""self inflicted."" RELATED: Exclusive: How John Roberts killed the census citizenship question The so-called ""Major Questions Doctrine"" is already seeing a lot of attention as the red states’ case is debated before the justices on Tuesday. But what exactly is it? Last term, the court cited the “Major Questions Doctrine” in a 6-3 decision that curbed the Environmental Protection Agency’s ability to broadly regulate carbon emissions from existing power plants. Under the theory, if an agency acts in a way that could have major political or economic implications, it must have the authority of Congress. The states are saying here that essentially, the college debt relief plan is too big for the Biden administration to use the authority in its citing. It's an argument that will appeal to the court's conservatives and their 6-3 majority over the liberals. Justice Samuel Alito, for instance, brought it up. “Is this the sort of thing that Congress is likely to address expressly or through a contestable interpretation of some statutory language?” Alito asked US Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar. “Well, of course, we think Congress did address this expressly here. And Congress directed that in the context of a national emergency – that is the limitation of the HEROES Act.” Prelogar replied. “The (Education) secretary acted within the heartland of his authority and in line with the central purpose of the HEROES Act in providing that relief here. To apply the Major Questions Doctrine to override that clear text will deny borrowers critical relief that Congress authorized and the secretary deemed essential,” Prelogar said. Chief Justice John Roberts drew attention to the fact that the Biden administration wants to use a power to ""modify"" federal student loan programs in order to cancel roughly $400 billion in debt. ""In an opinion we had a few years ago by Justice (Antonin) Scalia, he talked about what the word 'modify' means, and he said 'modified' in our view connotes moderate change,"" Roberts said.  ""It might be good English to say that the French Revolution modified the status of the French nobility, but only because there's a figure of speech called understatement and a literary device known as sarcasm,"" Roberts said. ""We're talking about half a trillion dollars and 43 million Americans. How does that fit under the normal understanding of modified?"" Roberts asked.  The Biden administration argues it has the power to cancel federal student loan debt under a 2003 law called the HEREOS Act. But the law does not explicitly say the secretary of education has the power to cancel or forgive student loan debt.  Instead, the law says the secretary of education has the power to “waive or modify” a federal student loan program in order to ensure that individuals “are not placed in a worse position financially” because of “a war or other military operation or national emergency.” US Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar argued that in the context of the statute, ""modify has to mean making a change up to the point of wholesale elimination.""  ""It would be really strange for Congress to say you can eliminate obligations altogether or tweak them just the littlest bit. But you can't do anything in between,"" she said.  ##Arguments## It did not take long for the issue of so-called ""standing"" to come up in Tuesday's arguments on the student loan relief program.  What does this mean? ""Standing"" refers to the harm a plaintiff must show they are facing in order for a court to intervene. The Biden administration argues that the challengers in the student debt forgiveness case have not overcome this procedural threshold, meaning that the Supreme Court could reject their case without even getting into the legal merits of the relief program. Justice Samuel Alito dug in on the issue in questions to US Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar and signaled that he was sympathetic to the argument that the states suing the administration had established standing. He pointed specifically to Missouri's claim that that the revenue shortfalls the Biden action could cause the Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority (MOHELA) — an entity that was created by the state to service student loans — could cause knock-on financial harms to Missouri itself. ""Why shouldn't the test be something more like whether the relationship between this entity and the state of Missouri is such that an injury to MOHELA will necessarily or presumptive be an injury to the state,"" Alito said. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson ultimately jumped in, to back up an argument Prelogar was making: that the financial interests of Missouri and MOHELA were not sufficiently  entangled to give Missouri standing. ##Arguments## Justice Clarence Thomas kicked off the oral arguments with the first round of questions, asking US Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar how the mass loan forgiveness amounts to the terminology used in the relevant statute. ""Would you take a minute to explain how a waiver or modification amounts to a ...cancellation,"" Thomas said. The Biden administration's foes in the case say that the terms ""waive"" or ""modify"" in the law giving the Education secretary certain powers applies to smaller bore actions to adjust repayment plants, rather than a blank cancellation of classes of debt. Prelogar told Thomas that the law in question, the HEROES Act, contemplates many forms of action an Education secretary could take in the face of a national emergency. Congress was trying to “cover the field” to give the secretary tools to respond to a national emergency, she said.  ##Arguments## The Supreme Court is now hearing oral arguments on two challenges to President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness program – an initiative aimed at providing targeted debt relief to millions of student-loan borrowers – that has so far been stalled by legal challenges. Republican-led states and conservatives challenging the program say it amounts to an unlawful attempt to erase an estimated $430 billion of federal student loan debt under the guise of the pandemic. At the heart of the case is the Department of Education’s authority to forgive the loans. Several of the conservative justices have signaled in recent years that agencies – with no direct accountability to the public – have become too powerful, upsetting the separation of powers. They have moved to cut back on the so-called administrative state. Tuesday’s cases will also highlight an important threshold question that could block the court from reaching the merits of the dispute: whether the parties behind the challenge have the legal right, or “standing,” necessary to bring suit. What both sides are arguing: The Biden administration argues that the secretary of education had the clear authority to provide the relief to borrowers making less than $125,000 per year ($250,000 for households) in 2020 or 2021 in order to protect them from financial harms brought on by the pandemic such as the inability to buy food or make rent or mortgage payments. As for the states, Nebraska Attorney General Michael T. Hilgers, who is also representing Missouri, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas and South Carolina, stressed that the Biden administration exceeded its authority by using the pandemic as a pretext to mask the true goal of fulfilling a campaign promise to erase student-loan debt. Desiree Veney, a senior at Morgan State University who qualified for potential loan forgiveness, said history is being made today. Crowds of people are outside the US Supreme Court Tuesday ahead of oral arguments in two cases that could decide the fate of President Joe Biden's student loan forgiveness program.  ""It's a very important day in history for not only me and also my peers,"" she told CNN. Veney, who is also the vice president of her college's NAACP chapter, is from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, but attends school in Maryland. This means she pays a lot more than some other students for out-of-state tuition, something she said will leave her at a disadvantage when she graduates.  Student debt has also prevented students at historically Black colleges and universities specifically from being able to invest or purchase homes, Veney said, expanding the racial wealth gap. Debt forgiveness would be an ""opportunity to create a stronger and a more stable foundation for my family and to create generational wealth afterward,"" she said, adding that it would give her more financial security after graduation and help further continue her education. ""If given this opportunity, it would be a blessing, yes, but it is kind of like you pray for the best, but prepare for the worst,"" Veney said. The Supreme Court oral arguments on President Joe Biden's student loan forgiveness program will kick off soon. First up at the podium before the nine justices will be US solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar.  She is expected to argue that the administration had the clear legal authority to provide relief to borrowers in order to protect them from the financial harms brought on by the pandemic, such as the inability to buy food or make rent or mortgage payments.  She will stress that the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003—known as the HEROES ACT—provides the legal authority for the relief. She will also say that the states do not have the sufficient injury necessary to bring the claim in the first place.  Next up will be Nebraska’s Solicitor General James A. Campbell – representing the six states involved — who will offer several theories to explain why the states will be injured if the plan is allowed to go into effect. Most of his theories revolve around the potential of lost tax revenue. He's also expected to stress that the plan amounts to an unlawful attempt to erase an estimated $430 billion of federal student loan debt under the guise of the pandemic.  Once Campbell wraps up, Prelogar will likely return to make a few closing arguments. The case is slated to last an hour, but look for it to go at least two hours.  Next comes the second case: With no break, the justices will then tackle the second case initially brought by two student borrowers. Prelogar will appear again and is expected to say that the students – Myra Brown and Alexander Taylor — like the states, don’t have the legal right to bring the case. She is likely to emphasize that the borrowers didn’t qualify for full relief in the first place, so they won’t be injured if the plan goes into effect.  J. Michael Connolly will then step up on behalf of Brown and Taylor. Connolly works for the boutique law firm Consovoy McCarthy, which also represented former President Donald Trump in some of his legal battles. The attorney is likely to repeat what he said in briefs. The HEROES ACT “does not authorize the Secretary to cancel nearly half-a-trillion dollars in debts held by tens of millions of individuals."" This case may not go as long as the first because so many of the issues are the same. Prelogar will then return to end the marathon session. What happens next: Under normal circumstances, a case with such high political stakes would likely be resolved in late June or early July. But because the justices expedited the briefing, there is a possibility they may prioritize the opinion and release it before the end of the term. The Supreme Court on Tuesday will take up two challenges to President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness program. Under the plan, approximately 40 million working and middle-class borrowers would receive up to $20,000 in relief, but Republican-led states and conservatives challenged the program shortly after in was announced, saying it's an unlawful attempt to erase an estimated $430 billion of federal student loan debt under the guise of the pandemic Advocates for student loan relief gathered outside the court ahead of the hearing on Monday night and Tuesday. See photos from the scene: About 26 million people had already applied for President Joe Biden's federal student loan forgiveness program when a federal district court judge struck down the plan in early November. No debt has been canceled thus far. The Supreme Court will hear arguments on Tuesday in two cases related to the program, with a decision expected by late June or early July. Here's what to know about Biden's challenged plan: Who is eligible? If the courts ultimately allow the program to move forward, not every student loan borrower is eligible for the debt relief. First, only federally held student loans qualify. Private student loans are excluded. Second, high-income borrowers are generally excluded from receiving debt forgiveness. Individual borrowers who make less than $125,000 a year and married couples or heads of households who make less than $250,000 annually could see up to $10,000 of their federal student loan debt forgiven. If a qualifying borrower also received a federal Pell grant while enrolled in college, the individual is eligible for up to $20,000 of debt forgiveness. What about current students? Some current students would be eligible under Biden’s plan if it’s allowed to take effect. Eligibility for borrowers who filed the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, known as the FAFSA, as an independent will be based on the individual’s own household income. What kinds of loans qualify? There are a variety of federal student loans and not all are eligible for relief if the program is allowed to proceed. Federal Direct Loans, including subsidized loans, unsubsidized loans, parent PLUS loans and graduate PLUS loans, are eligible. But federal student loans that are guaranteed by the government but held by private lenders are not eligible unless the borrower applied to consolidate those loans into a Direct Loan by September 29, 2022. Will borrowers have to pay taxes on forgiven loans? Borrowers will not have to pay federal income tax on the student loan debt forgiven, thanks to a provision in the American Rescue Plan Act that Congress passed in 2021. But it’s possible that some borrowers may have to pay state income tax on the amount of debt forgiven. There are a handful of states that may tax discharged debt if state legislative or administrative changes are not made beforehand, according to the Tax Policy Center. The tax liability could be hundreds of dollars, depending on the state. Find answers to other questions about the program here. ##Catch Up## There are some who are surprised that the Biden administration is coming to this conservative court and risking bad precedent. That’s because several of the justices have made clear in recent years that they believe federal agencies— that are unaccountable to the public —have become too powerful, upsetting the delicate separation of powers. In 2021, for instance, the court invalidated the Biden administration’s Covid-related eviction moratorium issued by the Centers for Disease Control holding that such a program needs to be specifically authorized by Congress.  In 2022, the court blocked a nationwide vaccine or testing mandate for large businesses, sending a clear message that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration had overstepped its authority.  And last term the court cited the so called “major questions doctrine” in a 6-3 decision that curbed the Environmental Protection Agency’s ability to broadly regulate carbon emissions from existing power plants. Under the theory, if an agency acts in a way that could have major political or economic implications, it must have the authority of Congress. In one of today's cases, the red states invoke the major questions doctrine — urging the justices to rule against the Biden administration’s student loan plan. Look for the conservatives on the court to repeatedly press the government on whether it exceeded its authority in pushing through its student loan forgiveness plan. Keep in mind that former President Donald Trump nominated Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh in part because they are often skeptical of government power. ##Analysis## The US Supreme Court will soon hear oral arguments in two cases challenging President Joe Biden's student loan forgiveness program. The Biden administration faced several lawsuits over the plan. The plaintiffs argue that the Department of Education is overstepping its authority. The plan would cancel up to $10,000 for some borrowers, and up to $20,000 to borrowers who received Pell Grants. Last fall, the Biden administration began notifying people who are approved for federal student loan relief. About 26 million people had already applied to the program by the time it was frozen prompting the government to stop taking applications. No debt has been canceled thus far. About the cases: One of the lawsuits was brought by six Republican-led states, headed by Nebraska, that argue that the student loan forgiveness program violates the separation of powers and the Administrative Procedure Act, a federal law that governs the process by which federal agencies issue regulations. They argue that it violates the separation of powers and that Biden is using the pandemic as a pretext to mask his true goal of fulfilling a campaign promise to erase student loan debt. A lower court judge dismissed this lawsuit on October 20, ruling that the plaintiffs did not have the legal standing to bring the challenge. In November, the 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and blocked the program. The other challenge that the Supreme Court will hear was brought by two individual borrowers – Myra Brown and Alexander Taylor – who are not qualified for full debt relief forgiveness and who say they were denied an opportunity to comment on the secretary of education’s decision to provided targeted student loan debt relief to some. The lawsuit was filed with the backing of a conservative group called the Job Creators Network Foundation. A federal judge in Texas ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, striking down the program on November 10. Lawyers for the government say that Congress gave the secretary of education “expansive authority to alleviate the hardship that federal student loan recipients may suffer as a result of national emergencies,” like the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a memo from the Department of Justice. ##Catch Up## It’s been nearly three years since the US government decided to allow borrowers to pause payments on student loans. Since then, the debate on whether to forgive student loans has reached the Supreme Court, which will hear the case later this month. Whether you paid off a car loan, put down a payment on a new home or made a big purchase that had a significant impact on your life, CNN wants to know if those extra dollars helped you make any financial strides. We know the issue of student loans disproportionately affects those from low-income backgrounds and minority groups, and we’d like to hear from you.  Click here and share your stories with us, and we may follow up for a CNN story. President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness program is at the mercy of the Supreme Court, and student loan borrowers could be waiting weeks, if not months, to hear whether the program is allowed to go into effect. But there are several other ways many of the 43 million federal student loan borrowers may qualify for student debt relief. Here's a look at some other programs:  Public Service Loan Forgiveness: The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program allows certain government and nonprofit employees to seek federal student loan forgiveness after making 10 years of qualifying payments. A qualifying borrower’s full remaining balance is canceled, regardless of the amount. Teachers, social workers, some nurses and doctors as well as government lawyers are some of the types of borrowers who may be eligible. Teacher Loan Forgiveness Program: The Teacher Loan Forgiveness Program cancels up to $17,500 in federal student loan debt for certain full-time teachers who have worked in a qualifying low-income elementary or secondary school for at least five consecutive years. Math and science teachers who are considered to be highly qualified at the secondary school level, as well as special education teachers at both the elementary and secondary levels, are eligible for the full $17,500 of federal student loan forgiveness. Those who are considered highly qualified and teach other subject areas may receive up to $5,000 in loan forgiveness. Borrower defense to repayment: The borrower defense to repayment program delivers student debt relief to people who were defrauded by their college. Generally, students who attended big, for-profit colleges like Corinthian Colleges and ITT Tech that have been found to have misled students with inflated job-placement numbers will qualify for forgiveness under the federal program. There are some groups of students that the Department of Education has already determined are automatically eligible for borrower defense to repayment, but other students may have to apply for debt relief, demonstrating how the schools misled them or engaged in other misconduct. Read about more of the programs here. If the Supreme Court strikes down President Biden’s student loan forgiveness program, it could be possible for the administration to make some modifications to the policy and try again – though that process could take months. “The ball goes back to the Biden administration,” said Luke Herrine, an assistant law professor at the University of Alabama who previously worked on a legal strategy for student debt cancellation. “The administration could implement some other version of this installation under a different legal authority, but that may well generate its own litigation and we end up in the same place,” Herrine added. The Biden administration is also working on changes to existing federal student loan repayment plans that aim to make it easier for borrowers to pay for college. These changes are not facing legal challenges. The Department of Education is currently finalizing a new income-driven repayment plan to lower monthly payments as well as the total amount borrowers pay back over time. In contrast to the one-time student loan cancellation program, the new repayment plan could help both current and future borrowers. Additionally, in July, changes will be made the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which allows certain government and nonprofit employees to seek federal student loan forgiveness after making 10 years of qualifying payments. The changes will make it easier for some borrowers to receive debt forgiveness. Millions of Americans have student loan debt, amassing to more than $1.6 trillion by the end of last year, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The Federal Reserve data shows people under the age of 30 are more likely to have student loan debt compared with older adults — underscoring the crippling burden on another generation of Americans. But the impact is multigenerational. Nearly a quarter of the outstanding student loan debt is owed by Americans who are 50 and older. Student debt has not always been a crisis. The modern federal education borrowing system came from a series of legislative moves aimed at helping more people have access to college — but it came with some unintended consequences. Here are some of the key moments: 1958: The first federal initiative  The National Student Loan program, aimed at expanding access to higher education, was launched in 1958. Created from the National Defense Education Act, it was the first federal student loan initiative for those studying certain subjects to improve science, mathematics and engineering skills during the Cold War. 1965: The Higher Education Act The Higher Education Act of 1965 opened the possibility of college to even more people, regardless of area of study — but it also created a new type of relationship between the federal government, banks and college campuses through the Guaranteed Student Loan program. It solved for the government the challenge of how to get lenders involved with such a risky financial investment: The loan did not come from the federal government, but instead, the government assured repayment to bankers willing to give loans, Shermer said. 1970: Sallie Mae and a boom in borrowing and private loans The Student Loan Marketing Association, known as Sallie Mae, was created through the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act in 1972. Sallie Mae offered private student loans along with other financial products. The availability of financial aid products to both for-profit and nonprofit companies allowed for the rise of private student loans, she said. That coupled with the rising cost of tuition in the 1970s meant that students needed more money to continue their education. Since there was a limit to how much students could borrow in federal loans, private loans were needed as a supplement. Another reason why private loans became more critical was pressure in Washington for Congress to cut taxes and cut spending, she said.

Critics, including the Republican-led states that have sued, say the initiative amounts to an unlawful attempt to erase an estimated $430 billion of federal student-loan debt under the guise of the pandemic. But the legal impact could go well beyond the fate of the program. The US Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in the state-led case plus another brought by individual borrowers backed by a conservative group on Tuesday. While most of the attention so far is focused on whether the Department of Education exceeded its authority in implementing the program, some court watchers are focused on an equally important procedural issue that is a major part of the case: whether the red states behind the challenge have the legal right, or “standing” to bring the dispute in the first place. The concept of standing is one that requires a party to establish an actual or imminent injury to get into court. Simply disagreeing with a policy is not enough. In recent years, states from one party have felt increasingly emboldened to come to court to sue an administration from a different party over a controversial policy. For the Biden administration, the issue is of critical importance now, especially as Republican-led states feel they have an advantage with the court’s 6-3 conservative majority. Professor Samuel Bray of Notre Dame Law School said it’s a problem for both Democratic and Republican administrations and he worries about states using the judicial branch to bring federal policymaking to a standstill. Judges are meant to decide concrete disputes between parties, the thinking goes, and they should not engage in political or policy debates better left to the other branches of government. Keep reading here.  Ahead of today's pivotal Supreme Court oral arguments, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona told CNN that the administration is assured in its authority to forgive $430 billion of federal student loan debt. ""We feel very confident in our case, in my authority under the HEROES Act, to provide relief over 40 million people across the country,"" Cardona said on ""CNN This Morning.""  What is the HEROES Act?: In court papers, US Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar stressed that the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003 – known as the HEROES Act – provides the government with the authority to offer the relief. Under the law, passed to help active-duty military in the wake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the government says the secretary of education has the authority to act in a national emergency to make sure borrowers are not left worse off with respect to their loans than they were before the emergency. ""We're working on fixing broken systems, but we feel confident that this plan is legal, based on the fact that it's off of the pandemic and the economic impact that the pandemic caused,"" Cardona said. The secretary added that the Covid-19 pandemic is a current ongoing crisis, despite Biden saying the pandemic is ""over"" in an interview on ""60 Minutes"" in September 2022. The administration plans to end the Covid-19 national and public health emergencies in May.  But Cardona said the ""economic impact of the pandemic is still real,"" adding that the majority of the student loan relief is targeted to those making under $75,000. The fate of President Joe Biden's student loan forgiveness program that would impact scores of borrowers from a wide array of colleges and socioeconomic backgrounds lies in the hands of nine relatively wealthy people who graduated from a short list of elite private schools. When the Biden administration goes before the Supreme Court Tuesday to defend the program, which would offer up to $20,000 of federal student debt forgiveness to millions of qualified borrowers, it will be making its arguments to a small group of jurists who are far from being representative of the borrowers that could benefit from the relief. The justices' salaries alone set them apart from most of the country: Chief Justice John Roberts will make $298,500 in 2023, while each of the associate justices will bring in $274,200 this year for their service. That doesn't include any revenue from outside sources, like book deals. The court is also comprised of some of the nation's brightest legal minds from a small number of prestigious schools, yet another factor that underscores their distance from the borrowers who could benefit from the debt relief assistance. Most of its current members attended one of two Ivy League law schools: Harvard and Yale. Roberts, along with Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson, Neil Gorsuch and Elena Kagan all attended Harvard Law School. Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh went to Yale Law School. The only current justice who is not part of the Ivy club is Amy Coney Barrett, who received her law degree from Notre Dame. Some of the justices had financial assistance to help them attend school: Thomas received a scholarship from Holy Cross College to pay for his undergraduate degree there, while Sotomayor attended Princeton University and Yale Law School on scholarships. And they have come from different backgrounds with different politics. Thomas, for instance, grew up in poverty in Pin Point, Georgia, and is the court's leading conservative justice.

It could be as late as summer before the justices rule on whether the policy can take effect, leaving borrowers uncertain about the future of their loan payments. The mired rollout of Biden’s forgiveness program has created confusion for borrowers. Here are some of the big questions still surrounding student loans: Will Biden's student loan forgiveness plan take effect? The Supreme Court will hear arguments in two cases concerning Biden’s student loan forgiveness program on Tuesday, which could deliver up to $20,000 of debt relief for millions of low- and middle-income borrowers. A decision on whether the program is legal and can move forward is expected by June. Until then, it is on hold and no debt will be discharged under the program. Litigants argue the Biden administration has overstepped its authority, and other recent Supreme Court decisions have ruled against aggressive executive agency actions. However, lawyers for the Biden administration say that Congress gave the secretary of education “expansive authority to alleviate the hardship that federal student loan recipients may suffer as a result of national emergencies,” like the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a memo from the Department of Justice. When will the pandemic pause on payments end? For the third consecutive year, federal student loan borrowers started 2023 without having to make payments on their loans thanks to a pandemic-related pause. Payments were set to resume in January, but the Biden administration extended the pause after its student loan forgiveness program was halted by federal courts. Officials had told borrowers debt relief would be granted before payments restarted. The payment pause will now last until 60 days after litigation over Biden’s student loan forgiveness program is resolved. If the program has not been implemented and the litigation has not been resolved by June 30, payments will resume 60 days after that. What about the new student loan repayment plan? The Biden administration has proposed big changes to existing income-driven repayment plans, aimed at making payments more manageable for borrowers. It’s unclear when the reforms may take effect. The changes, which could impact roughly 8 million people currently enrolled in income-driven repayment plans and open up the plans for more borrowers, would reduce monthly debt burdens, as well as the total amount borrowers, pay over the lifetime of their loans.  The Department of Education expects to start implementing some parts of the new income-driven repayment plan later this year but needs to go through a rulemaking process first.

Fox faces an 'existential threat' from its multibillion-dollar defamation cases,2023-02-28,"Fox Chairman Rupert Murdoch said under oath that he made a business decision when allowing a conspiracy theorist to promote election lies on Fox News. ""It is not red or blue; it is green,"" he told lawyers in a deposition made public Monday.  But spreading falsehoods about the 2020 presidential election for the money may prove extremely costly for Fox.   The network faces two separate defamation lawsuits from voting technology companies that collectively seek $4.3 billion in damages. Fox Corporation, the right-wing news outlet's owner, has an estimated $4 billion in cash on hand, according to its latest earnings statement.   ""When damages get into the billions, with a B, that can be an existential threat to a journalistic organization — even one as lucrative as as Fox,"" said Lyrissa Lidsky, a constitutional law professor at the University of Florida.  Even if the damages are exaggerated, Lidsky said, a verdict against Fox in either case would be ""a terrible reputational black eye."" Murdoch's bombshell deposition — in which he acknowledged that some Fox hosts endorsed false claims that the 2020 election was stolen — could be a game-changer for Dominion's case, which hinges on meeting a high legal bar known as ""actual malice."" To meet that standard, a plaintiff has to show that the defendant made defamatory statements with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard for the truth.  ""This is one of the most devastating depositions that I've ever seen,"" CNN legal analyst Norm Eisen said Monday. ""When you go beyond reporting and your chairman admits there was endorsement, then that opens you up to liability under the actual malice standard.""  If Fox were to lose either case, it's not guaranteed that it would have to pay the full amount if a jury decides the damages were excessive.  On the other hand, Eisen noted, a jury could also increase the award. ""If the jury decides that it was bad enough conduct, they can double or triple that $1.6 billion or go even higher,"" Eisen told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. Cases against Fox Dominion Voting Systems is suing Fox News and Fox Corporation for $1.6 billion, accusing the network of spreading false claims that its technology enabled election fraud. A trial is set for April.  A separate, similar case brought by voting technology firm Smartmatic is seeking $2.7 billion in damages. Media companies typically have insurance that would cover defamation payouts, though details of Fox's coverage aren't known. Defamation is notoriously difficult to prove in the United States, which grants news organizations and entertainment companies wide berth under the First Amendment. Fox has repeatedly stressed that airing the fraud claims was newsworthy and protected under the Constitution.  But Dominion's case is unusually strong, legal experts say.  ""The evidence that's been put into the public sphere so far looks like strong evidence that Fox knew the truth and decided to go with an alternate narrative,"" Lidsky says.  Legal filings from Dominion have shown behind-the-scenes messages showing Fox's stars — including Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, and Laura Ingraham — mock the lies being pushed by the former president Trump's camp asserting that the election was rigged. It also illustrated instances of Fox actively pushing back on fact-checks that undermined the election lies being peddled by supporters of former President Donald Trump.   Murdoch, meanwhile, conceded that Sean Hannity, Jeanine Pirro, Maria Bartiromo, and former host Lou Dobbs promoted falsehoods about the presidential contest being stolen. ""Some of our commentators were endorsing it,,"" Murdoch said, according to the filing, when asked about the hosts' on-air positions about the election. ""I would have liked us to be stronger in denouncing it, in hindsight,"" he added. The filing also revealed that Murdoch referred to some of Trump's 2020 election lies as ""bulls**t and damaging."" In a statement, Fox pushed back against Dominion's legal standing, saying the company's lawsuit ""has always been more about what will generate headlines than what can withstand legal and factual scrutiny.""  —CNN's Oliver Darcy contributed to this article.","{'neg': 0.274, 'neu': 0.726, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.5267}",30,32.0,0.168,0.765,0.067,-0.40409999999999996,0.147,0.74,0.113,-0.9845,-12.123,-56.238299999999995,569.0,-0.09883708260105448
Top US Defense official says Iran could produce 'one bomb's worth of fissile material' in 'about 12 days',2023-02-28,"Iran could now produce ""one bomb's worth of fissile material"" in ""about 12 days,"" a top US Defense Department official said Tuesday. Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl offered one of the most striking US government assessments to date of Iran's ""breakout time"" as efforts to try to restore the Iran nuclear agreement remain halted and Tehran continues to breach the restrictions set out by the deal. Kahl said that ""Iran's nuclear progress since"" the Trump administration withdrew the United States from the 2015 nuclear deal ""has been remarkable."" ""Back in 2018, when the previous administration decided to leave the JCPOA, it would have taken Iran about 12 months to produce one fissile, one bomb's worth of fissile material,"" Kahl said at a House Armed Services Committee hearing, using the acronym for the formal name of the deal: the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. ""Now it would take about 12 days,"" he said. Biden administration officials have for months said that Iran's breakout time -- the amount of time it would need to produce enough weapons-grade material for one nuclear bomb -- had dwindled to a matter of weeks. The breakout time does not mean that Iran could produce an actual bomb in that amount of time. Kahl's comments -- set against reports of Iran's continued enrichment of uranium in violation of the deal -- present a striking picture of the challenges facing the increasingly defunct agreement. In a restricted report seen by CNN, the International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed that uranium particles enriched to 83.7% purity -- which is close to the 90% enrichment levels needed to make a nuclear bomb -- had been found in Iran's Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant, an underground nuclear facility. According to the confidential IAEA report, Iran's stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60% had grown by 25.2 kg to 87.5 kg since the agency's last quarterly report. ""It is quite clear that Iran enriched uranium to near weapons-grade levels,"" Kelsey Davenport, the Director for Nonproliferation Policy at the Arms Control Association, told CNN. She said Tehran may have been ""testing political responses to higher levels of enrichment or it was experimenting and it got caught,"" noting that it underscores the rapid advancement of Iran's nuclear program and the high risk of miscalculation. Davenport also told CNN that Iran's ""significant increase"" in its enriched uranium stockpiles is ""a serious concern."" ""When Iran can rapidly produce enough weapons grade material for several bombs, the proliferation risk rises significantly,"" she explained. ""This is an urgent proliferation crisis,"" she said. US officials have repeatedly said they are seeking a diplomatic solution to the matter, but have maintained that all options, including military ones, are on the table.  More than a year of indirect negotiations between the US and Iran to try to restore the deal broke down in September 2022, as the US accused Iran of making ""unreasonable"" demands related to a probe by the IAEA, which is the UN's nuclear watchdog, into unexplained traces of uranium found at undisclosed Iranian sites.  In recent months, the administration has said the agreement is ""not on the agenda,"" in the words of State Department spokesperson Ned Price.  Kahl said Tuesday that the agreement is ""on ice"" in part because ""Iran's behavior has changed since then, not the least of which their support for Russia and Ukraine.""

US is reviewing Huawei export license policy amid rising congressional scrutiny of China,2023-02-28,"The US government is reviewing a policy that permits certain US exports to continue to Huawei, despite an overall push by the Trump and Biden administrations to block the Chinese telecommunications giant from receiving American technology. Alan Estevez, a Commerce Department official, told lawmakers Tuesday that the policy is ""under assessment"" as the agency conducts a ""top-to-bottom review of our export control policies related to the [People's Republic of China]."" Estevez testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, which was holding a hearing to scrutinize China's impact on US national security.  In 2019, Huawei was one of a number of Chinese companies placed on the Commerce Department's Entity List, which prohibits US companies from trading specified items with entities named on the list unless they obtain a license to do so.  US officials have expressed concerns that Huawei's 5G wireless networking gear could allow the Chinese government to spy on American communications. Huawei has denied that it poses a security risk, and its founder has said the company would resist any Chinese government effort to obtain its data.  According to Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Michael McCaul, between January and March of 2022 the Commerce Department approved more than $23 billion in license applications to trade with Chinese-affiliated companies on the Entity List. Confronting Estevez at Tuesday's hearing, McCaul asked the Commerce Department to square the license approvals with the US government's wider effort to sideline Huawei and similar companies.  ""A licensing rule of the previous administration that still stands for Huawei allows things below 5G, below cloud-level to go,"" Estevez said, ""and I will say that all those things are under assessment."" Entity List restrictions do not provide for a ""blanket embargo"" on exports generally, Estevez added, but rather reflect specific rules about particular exports.  Separately, in 2020 the Commerce Department moved to prevent Huawei's suppliers from selling the company semiconductor chips made by US-built software and equipment, unless those suppliers also obtained a license. Other parts of the US government have also moved against Huawei. The Federal Communications Commission has prohibited US wireless carriers from using federal funding to purchase Huawei networking gear, and last year also banned future approvals of Huawei equipment for sale in the United States, in the first use of the FCC's equipment authorization authority for a national security purpose.

Blinken's new warning to Beijing is the latest sign of deteriorating US-China relations,2023-02-28,"The United States directly warned Tuesday that it would target Chinese firms or people involved in any effort to send lethal aid to Russia for its war in Ukraine, underscoring a fast-deepening showdown with its superpower rival. In the most specific public admonition on the issue to Beijing so far, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken underlined that arming Moscow's forces would cause China serious problems around the world. ""China can't have it both ways when it comes to ... the Russian aggression in Ukraine. It can't be putting forward peace proposals on the one hand, while actually feeding the flames of the fire that Russia has started with the other hand,"" Blinken said in Kazakhstan. US officials have spent the past 10 days warning that it has intelligence that China is considering sending lethal aid to Russia, causing fury in Beijing and underscoring how already deteriorating diplomatic relations are being rocked by almost daily crises -- from a recent spy balloon controversy to a revived dispute over the specific origins of Covid-19. On Monday evening, the White House gave federal agencies a 30-day deadline to remove TikTok, which is owned by Chinese company ByteDance, from federal devices. And later Tuesday, a new House select committee will hold its first hearing on the fast-widening US-China rivalry. In his clearest comments about how the US would respond if China did decide to help its ally Russia with lethal aid, Blinken spoke of punishments for Chinese firms that could cause Beijing to pay an economic price. ""We did very clearly warn China about the implications and consequences of going through with providing such support,"" referring to his own meeting with top Chinese diplomat Wang Yi in Munich this month and President Joe Biden's talks with President Xi Jinping in Indonesia in November 2022. ""We will not hesitate, for example, to target Chinese companies or individuals that violate our sanctions, or otherwise engaged in supporting the Russian war effort,"" he said.  New confrontations -- along with rising tensions between US and Chinese forces in Asia and escalating standoffs over Taiwan -- are dramatizing a long-building and once theoretical superpower rivalry that is suddenly a daily reality.  This increasingly adversarial relationship touches multiple areas of American life -- from the economy to public health. It spans the challenges faced by the US military, which are amid the great geopolitical clashes of the early 21st century like in Ukraine to risks posed by the Chinese-designed apps on the electronic devices everyone carries everywhere. It's fueling the dangerous possibility that the US and China are locked into a potentially disastrous slide toward conflict. And it poses serious challenges for a polarized US political system that struggles to have a rational debate on these issues without descending into a partisan game of who can be tougher on China. Such one-upmanship only deepens a self-perpetuating cycle of escalation between the two sides. It is in this politicized atmosphere that the GOP-controlled House is debuting a new bipartisan select committee on competition with China during a primetime hearing on Tuesday night, just as Washington-Beijing tensions have rarely been worse. The committee's work will be based on the premise that after years of trying to integrate China peacefully into the global system as a competitor not an enemy, the US is switching to a tougher stance in a belief that a new generation of Chinese leaders is trying to dismantle the US global order and international law. Republican Rep. Mike Gallagher, the new committee's chairman, told CNN's Manu Raju that Tuesday's hearing would not focus specifically on the latest drama -- after the Department of Energy assessed with low confidence that the Covid-19 pandemic originated with a lab leak in the Chinese city of Wuhan. He said that finding, which is a minority view among US intelligence agencies, could be examined in a future hearing but that he wanted to show Americans on Tuesday that the threat from China was ""not just an over there problem, it's ... right here."" ""We want to understand what we got wrong about the Chinese Communist Party and what we need to understand about it going forward in order to get our policy right,"" the Wisconsin Republican said.  On CBS News on Sunday, Gallagher warned: ""We may call this a strategic competition, but it's not a tennis match. This is about what type of world we want to live in. Do we want to live in Xinjiang-lite or do we want to live in the free world?"" he said, referring to the Chinese region where the US has accused China of inflicting genocide on the Uyghur minority, a charge China continues to vehemently deny. The committee may be one of the few areas where a divided Congress -- and potentially the White House -- can find common ground. The Biden administration has reinforced the already tough stance toward China that ex-President Donald Trump adopted later in his presidency. Biden, for instance, last year signed a new law that will allow the government to spend $200 billion in a bid to claim the leadership of the semiconductor chips industry -- a critical sector that could decide the economic race between the US and China in decades to come. Covid-19 origin controversy starts new pan-Pacific war of words  The new controversy over the origins of Covid-19 is a study in isolation of many of the forces ripping at US-China relations, including US mistrust of the Chinese Communist Party and its leader Xi Jinping's desire to preserve his prestige and that of a political system he holds up as an alternative to Western democracy. US demands for information about the origins of the pandemic show how China is refusing to play by global rules -- in this case, in allowing follow-up virological investigations. All of this only exacerbates intense reaction in Washington, and in turn tears at US political fault lines.  There is no consensus within the US government on the origins of the pandemic. Intelligence agencies remain divided over whether it started with animal to human transmission in a Wuhan wet market or originated in a viral leak from a Chinese laboratory -- and no new evidence has emerged publicly in support of the lab leak theory. Investigating the origins is hugely important.  ""There is a bottom line here, which is that neither lab leak, nor spillover -- i.e. animal origin -- can be ruled out. We don't have definitive information,"" Tom Frieden, the former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told CNN on Monday.  But it didn't take long for Republicans to claim political victory in the wake of Sunday's Wall Street Journal report about new intelligence causing the Department of Energy to believe with low confidence that a lab leak was to blame. Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has been accused of spreading conspiracy theories about the pandemic, tweeted, ""Conspiracy theorists - 100 Media - 0.""  Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas tweeted: ""Re. China's lab leak, being proven right doesn't matter. What matters is holding the Chinese Communist Party accountable so this doesn't happen again."" Such definitive statements, based on one assessment, do not recognize that the US intelligence community is still divided over the matter. Some Republicans have long sought to prove that the virus was a conspiracy by China to unleash contagion on the world, and many have long appeared to be seeking an explanation for the pandemic that could mask Trump's negligence in handling it. But even if the virus did emerge from a laboratory, it doesn't mean it was necessarily man made or that the rest of the world was deliberately exposed.  China's foreign ministry reacted angrily to the reemergence of the lab leak theory in Washington, warning that Americans should ""stop stirring up arguments about laboratory leaks, stop smearing China and stop politicizing the issue of the virus origin.""  In many ways, it doesn't matter if poor security at a lab in China or animal transmission caused the pandemic that killed nearly seven million people globally, according to World Health Organization figures, and more than a million in the US. Both possible routes of transmission represent a threat to humanity and need to be addressed, which is one reason why China's lack of transparency on the issue is so potentially dangerous. The pandemic remains a huge embarrassment for China, souring its national mythology of a mighty rising power.  But in Washington this week, the issue has again degenerated into an excuse for Republicans to target scientists and government health experts and to twist a narrative about Covid-19 that still has massive gaps.  The challenge for the new select committee, which is especially probing economic and technological competition with China, will be to break this cycle of politicization to provide a useful examination of US-China relations that could result in effective policy recommendations down the road. The US and China have a new area of confrontation -- Ukraine  Another example of how the wider antagonism between the United States and China is coloring other crises is evident with Ukraine. The US, citing unpublished intelligence, has spent the last week warning that China is considering sending lethal aid to bolster Russia's forces -- a situation that would effectively put China on the opposite side of a proxy war with the US and NATO powers that have sent billions of dollars in weapons to Ukraine. Beijing has long amplified Russia's justifications for the invasion, which took place a year ago shortly after Russian President Vladimir Putin traveled to the Chinese capital to agree to a friendship with ""no limits"" with Xi. China would prefer Russia, which shares its autocratic form of government, not to suffer a total defeat in Ukraine -- which could lead to the ousting of close ally Putin. And China increasingly tends to view its global interests through the prism of its standoff with the US, so it may perceive an advantage in Washington being locked in an arms-length conflict in Ukraine that is costing billions of dollars and to which it is sending reserve military equipment and ammunition that can therefore not be used to bolster its Pacific forces. Delays in procurement in the US arms industry caused by Ukraine could also slow the flow of weapons to Taiwan.  Yet a decision by China to throw in its lot with Russia in Ukraine would amount to a radical change in foreign policy -- and another massive plunge in US-China relations. Washington and the European Union would certainly respond with sanctions on Chinese firms, a threat that will likely give leaders in Beijing pause, as the country's economy slowly recovers from years of Covid isolation. ""China has never had to incur any costs for its support for Russia.

Top Republicans question McCarthy over release of January 6 footage as speaker vows deliberate approach,2023-02-28,"Speaker Kevin McCarthy faced questions from his leadership team Monday night over his plans to publicly release security footage from January 6, 2021, multiple sources told CNN -- a process that he said could take some time to disseminate widely even as Fox News host Tucker Carlson has had an early glimpse. While GOP leaders are supportive of the move to release the footage -- which was one of the many concessions McCarthy made in his bid to become speaker -- some lawmakers in the closed-door leadership meeting asked whether sensitive security protocols or certain evacuation routes would be exposed by taking that step.  Others questioned how long the footage is going to be dragged out in the press, with some lawmakers concerned about the optics of appearing to try to downplay a deadly insurrection in the US Capitol.  ""Let's just rip the Band-aid off and get this over with,"" one GOP lawmaker told CNN. Sources said McCarthy assured his leadership team that he wants to move swiftly, but said they need to be deliberate about how they handle it to ensure the release does not endanger their security. He also told lawmakers that other media outlets will get access to the footage after Carlson airs his exclusive, but it could take a few weeks. CNN, along with a group of other media organizations, has signed on to a letter calling for congressional leaders to grant access to the security footage from the riot. A congressional source familiar with the matter said there were ongoing discussions with the Capitol Police about what restrictions should be placed on the footage and that it remained unclear exactly what limitations would be on the video that Carlson will be allowed to air. But even giving Carlson the video footage has spawned widespread concerns, given the conservative host has pushed conspiracy theories about the attack and downplayed the violence at the hands of Trump supporters. House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik of New York confirmed that the topic came up in their leadership meeting and said she fully supports McCarthy's decision to publicly release the footage. She also said Republicans would ensure that law enforcement and security protocols are protected. ""Unlike Democrats, we do work very effectively with the Capitol Police. And we respect law enforcement,"" Stefanik told CNN. ""This is about transparency."" McCarthy, who initially told reporters he would answer questions on Monday, left the Capitol and avoided reporters and questions about the matter. McCarthy defended his decision to publicly release the footage during a closed-door conference meeting on Tuesday morning, according to sources in the room.  McCarthy said the release was an important step in the name of transparency and argued that there wasn't outcry when the select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection showed clips at their public hearings of then-Vice President Mike Pence's evacuation. That select committee never revealed Pence's exact escape route but showed photos of him in the garage where he was hiding during the riot. One of McCarthy's closest allies, Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene -- who also has downplayed the January 6 attack -- backed his decision to give the footage to Carlson. She told CNN on Monday she played a role in McCarthy's decision, but she wouldn't go into further detail.  Greene, who was not in the Monday night meeting, said she's spoken with McCarthy, and that the speaker's office is coordinating a process for how to release the footage more widely, beyond Fox News, while also ensuring it doesn't violate any security concerns.  ""We can't give away our national security,"" Greene said, ""Everyone in Congress agrees. And I think the American people agree. We don't want Russia or China or any of these other countries being able to study all the entries and exits of our capital. That's foolish."" Greene told CNN that Carlson's team was also given certain parameters for what they could and couldn't air. ""Yes ... of course (there were parameters) they're being extremely careful and responsible.""  ""I think it is any day now,"" Greene told CNN of when to expect some of the footage to air on Fox News. Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, who urged the speaker to release the footage as McCarthy was courting his vote for the speakership, would not say if that was part of the commitment made to encourage him to vote ""present"" and help the California Republican's cause. ""I think it's getting released,"" Gaetz told CNN of the security footage. Top Democrats, too, are closely monitoring the matter. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said he and McCarthy ""have not had an extended conversation"" yet about releasing the footage to Carlson.  ""But I look forward to talking to him this week and further about figuring out an approach that makes sense and respects the security concerns that many members have articulated in the House,"" Jeffries said of the speaker. Top Democrats are waiting to see what footage is ultimately released before taking position on whether the full media should also have access to it, a source familiar with the matter said. Asked if he believed the footage should be released widely to the media, Jeffries told CNN: ""I have no comment on that right now."" Other Democrats were outraged at the speaker. Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, who chaired the select committee on January 6, told CNN that McCarthy ""opened up a can of worms"" by agreeing to release the footage to Carlson and dinged the California Republican for fundraising off the move, which he said puts ""the institution at risk.""

Four takeaways from DeSantis' new book rehashing his culture clashes as Florida governor,2023-02-27,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' new book, ""The Courage to Be Free,"" leans into the culture wars that established him as one of the early Republican favorites for the GOP nomination for the presidency.  While more sparse on biographical details than most political memoirs, the 256-page book offers some new insights into his upbringing, college years and military service. But mostly, DeSantis rehashes his contentious four years as governor and suggests he has laid a path for others to follow.  ""The battles we have fought in Florida -- from defeating the biomedical security state to stifling woke corporations to fighting indoctrination in schools -- strike at the heart of what it means to be a Floridian and an American,"" DeSantis writes. The book's release has coincided with the soft-launch of the Republican's presidential campaign and it ends with a forward-looking note that alludes at the next challenge ahead. ""The Florida Blueprint is a simple formula: be willing to lead, have the courage of your convictions, deliver for your constituents, and reap the political rewards. This is a blueprint for America's revival. We've shown it can be done,"" he writes. CNN obtained an advance copy of the book before its publication on Tuesday. Here are four takeaways: DeSantis (gently) pushes back against Trump DeSantis largely avoids direct confrontation with former President Donald Trump, whom he praises for his ""unique star power,"" ""massive following"" and  ""filling the void that GOP leaders had left by ignoring the preferences of their own voters."" He continued his defense of Trump's 2016 campaign against investigations for Russian election interference.  But DeSantis expended considerable ink challenging Trump's version of the 2018 Florida governor race to claim back credit for his victory.  Trump has claimed DeSantis ""begged"" for a gubernatorial endorsement in the Republican gubernatorial primary -- shed tears even. Before Trump got involved, DeSantis was ""dead"" and ""leaving the race,"" the former president recently told conservative radio talk show host Hugh Hewitt. DeSantis recalled asking Trump in late 2017 ""if he would be willing to send out a tweet touting me as a good candidate for Florida governor."" Trump, DeSantis said, ""seemed amenable, but at the same time, I was not holding my breath."" Trump did tweet about DeSantis, calling him ""a brilliant young leader"" and playing up the then-congressman's Ivy League credentials.  In DeSantis' telling, he recognized the power of Trump's endorsement, but suggested its appeal was limited. ""I do not think Republican primary voters are sheep who simply follow an endorsement from a politician they like without any individual analysis, but I do believe that a major endorsement can put a candidate on the radar of GOP voters in a way that boosts a good candidate's prospects,"" he writes. DeSantis later says it was his debate performance, not Trump's support, that led to a reversal in the polling. He omitted, though, that Trump had tweeted a more forceful ""full endorsement"" of DeSantis just two months before the primary. Nor did he note that Trump sent a team of Florida operatives to help DeSantis' campaign after the primary.  Throughout the book, DeSantis finds more opportunities to undercut the former president. At several points, DeSantis bemoans the lack of activity in Trump's first two years in office, when Republicans controlled the House and Senate. Though he doesn't blame Trump explicitly, when juxtaposed against his own record compelling Republican lawmakers in his state to act repeatedly in service of his agenda, the implication seems clear.  ""Here we had a unified Republican government for the first time in more than a decade, and yet so much of the time was frittered away on matters like the conspiracy theory that Donald Trump's campaign had colluded with Russia, which GOP-led committees investigated for two years,"" he writes. ""Why Congress didn't do more significant things, such as appropriating money to build the wall at the US-Mexico border, was beyond me."" Inside the feud with Disney DeSantis' book frames his battle with Disney as a demarcation line in his political story. It's mentioned on the second page of the introduction. The juiciest excerpts from that particular chapter (which he labeled ""The Magic Kingdom of Woke Corporatism"") were released in advance to Fox News. And, in a symbolic move, he signed the bill to remove Disney's special governing powers Monday, the eve of his book's release.  DeSantis' views his own political feud with the company as somewhat ironic, given that he married his wife in Disney World. He also is quite clear that his wife, Casey, who hailed from ""a family of Disney enthusiasts,"" was the catalyst for the location of their nuptials. ""My only condition was that no Disney characters could be part of our wedding,"" he wrote. ""I wanted our special day to look and feel like a traditional wedding. I didn't want Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck in our wedding photos."" His relationship with Florida's largest employer broke down last year as outrage intensified over a Florida bill to limit the instruction of sexual orientation and gender identity. DeSantis recalled then-Disney CEO Bob Chapek told him during a phone call that he did not want to get the company involved but was under pressure to weigh in.  DeSantis urged Chapek to steer clear and suggested the blowback would pass in 48 hours once there is ""some new outrage that the woke mob will focus on."" ""You will end up putting yourself in an untenable position,"" he recalled telling Chapek. ""People like me will say, Gee, how come Disney has never said anything about China, where they make a fortune?'"" Disney ultimately weighed in, saying in a statement that it was ""dedicated to standing up for the rights and safety of LGBTQ+ members of the Disney family, as well as the LGBTQ+ community in Florida and across the country."" And DeSantis pounced, as he said he would. To DeSantis, the episode is a microcosm of a greater struggle between the fight conservatives expect from GOP leaders and the instincts of Republicans not to meddle in the affairs of businesses. DeSantis argues, ""In this environment, old-guard corporate Republicanism is not up to the task at hand.""  ""Unfortunately, the sad upshot of these changes is that corporate America has become a major protagonist in battles over American politics and culture. The battle lines almost invariably find large, publicly traded corporations lining up behind leftist causes,"" he writes. ""It is unthinkable that these large companies would side with conservative Americans on issues such as the Second Amendment, the right to life, election integrity, and religious liberty."" DeSantis vs. DeSantis DeSantis' first book, the little-read ""Dreams from Our Founding Fathers"" published in 2011, is a case for limited government, separation of powers, humble leadership and executive constraint. DeSantis' latest book is a defense of his most contentious executive actions, achieved by consolidating power and flexing executive authority, in ways that suggest he has undergone an evolution of his previous principles.  In ""The Courage to be Free,"" DeSantis -- the former star athlete and Naval officer -- demonstrates a tactical precision for using his executive powers in ways intended to keep Democrats and the media off guard in pursuit of an aggressive and partisan agenda. He brought to the job, he writes, ""an understanding of how a constitutional form of government operates, the various pressure points that exist, and the best way to leverage authority to achieve substantial policy victories."" ""One of my first orders of business after getting elected was to have my transition team amass an exhaustive list of all the constitutional, statutory, and customary powers of the governor. I wanted to be sure that I was using every lever available to advance our priorities,"" he writes. DeSantis, looking to jumpstart his political career in 2011, eviscerated then-President Barack Obama for what he described as executive overreach. He accused Obama's then-health and human services secretary, Kathleen Sebelius, of using ""her power to intimidate private businesses for engaging in speech she didn't like."" He wrote Obama was ""resorting to using crude vulgarisms, such as the term 'teabagger,' to describe their fellow citizens simply because these citizens dissented from progressive orthodoxy."" But in ""The Courage to Be Free,"" labeling corporations as ""woke"" and punishing those that speak out ""is not only prudent but necessary to counteract efforts by large corporations to impose a woke agenda on the rest of us."" As DeSantis writes: ""It is regrettable that our nation has become so politicized, but the fact is that private companies wielding de facto public power is not in the best interests of most Americans."" Continuing to litigate his coronavirus response DeSantis built his reelection for governor around his response to Covid-19 and his book makes clear he will continue to make that a part of his message as he looks toward a potential campaign for president.  As he often does, DeSantis described Florida as a ""citadel of freedom in the United States,"" and defended his actions to reopen schools for the 2020-2021 school year.  ""When I announced Florida's back to school policy, perhaps because I did so during the height of the summer COVID-19 wave, there was substantial public opposition to my decision,"" DeSantis says. ""For all the controversy that swirled around my decision, and all the incoming fire I took by making it, there was never a doubt in my mind that keeping our schools open was right for our state."" ""Keeping Florida free"" from Covid-19 restrictions has earned DeSantis criticism from Democrats and health experts -- a badge he proudly wears. But DeSantis also puts up his response against the rest of the country, even Trump, who he noted stood behind health officials who pushed states to shut down activity for two weeks to slow the spread.  DeSantis also shared insight into his efforts to open up Florida for sports, including a promise to UFC president Dana White to big foot any local government that prevented him from holding fights in Florida. ""I will overrule any mayor that gives you guys a hard time,"" DeSantis told White. DeSantis called for a ""thorough and unbiased investigation of all aspects of the pandemic,"" including the origins of the virus.  On Monday, John Kirby, National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications, said, ""There is not a consensus right now, in the US government about exactly how Covid got started. There is just not an intelligence community consensus."" Kirby added that Biden made trying to find the origins of Covid a ""priority.""

What to watch for as the Supreme Court hears oral arguments on Biden's student loan debt relief plan,2023-02-28,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday will take up two challenges to President Joe Biden's student loan forgiveness program -- an initiative aimed at providing targeted debt relief to millions of student-loan borrowers -- that has so far been stalled by legal challenges.    Republican-led states and conservatives challenging the program say it amounts to an unlawful attempt to erase an estimated $430 billion of federal student loan debt under the guise of the pandemic.  At the heart of the case is the Department of Education's authority to forgive the loans. Several of the conservative justices have signaled in recent years that agencies -- with no direct accountability to the public -- have become too powerful, upsetting the separation of powers. They have moved to cut back on the so-called administrative state. In 2021, for instance, the court invalidated the Biden administration's Covid-19-related eviction moratorium issued by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention holding that such a program needs to be specifically authorized by Congress. In 2022, the court blocked a nationwide vaccine or testing mandate for large businesses, sending a clear message that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration had overstepped its authority.  Tuesday's cases will also highlight an important threshold question that could block the court from reaching the merits of the dispute: whether the parties behind the challenge have the legal right, or ""standing,"" necessary to bring suit.  Payments paused  In 2020, as the Covid pandemic began, the Department of Education paused payments and interest in accrual on student loans to help those struggling financially. As the pandemic progressed, both the Trump and the Biden administrations further extended the protections.   By 2022, however, the Biden administration's secretary of Education, Miguel Cardona, determined that the across-the-board pause on all payments should come to an end. Fearing that the resumption of payments would put many lower-income borrowers at heightened risk of loan delinquency, the administration said it would offer relief up to $20,000 to approximately 40 million working and middle-class borrowers.    The plan, Biden said, was meant to ""provide more breathing room for people so they have less burden by student debt.""   The initiative came under immediate attack. A district court blocked the program citing the so-called major questions doctrine. Under the doctrine, federal agencies cannot regulate matters of ""vast economic and political significance"" without clear authorization from Congress.  (Last June, the Supreme Court emboldened supporters of the doctrine by citing it in a 6-3 decision that curbed the Environmental Protection Agency's ability to broadly regulate carbon emissions from existing power plants.)  As other challenges to the student loan program percolated, the Biden administration asked the Supreme Court to step in and allow the program to go into effect pending appeal.  The justices declined to do so, but they agreed to hear two cases on an expedited basis. The first dispute, Biden v. Nebraska, pits the administration against a group of Republican-led states. The second, Department of Education v. Brown, was initially brought by Myra Brown and Alexander Taylor, two individuals who did not qualify for the program and argue the government failed to follow proper rulemaking process when putting it in place.  As for the payment obligations, they were set to resume last January, but the president issued an extension due to the fact that his loan forgiveness program was stalled in court.    As things stand, the payment pause will last until 60 days after the litigation over the loan forgiveness program is resolved. If the program has not been implemented and the litigation has not been resolved by June 30, payment will resume 60 days after that, according to the government.  What the Biden administration is saying  At the Supreme Court, the Biden administration argues that the secretary of education had the clear authority to provide the relief to borrowers making less than $125,000 per year ($250,000 for households) in 2020 or 2021 in order to protect them from financial harms brought on by the pandemic such as the inability to buy food or make rent or mortgage payments.     In court papers, Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar stressed that the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003 -- known as the HEROES ACT -- provides the government with the authority to offer the relief. Under the law, passed to help active-duty military in the wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the government says the secretary of education has the authority to act in a national emergency to make sure borrowers are not left worse off with respect to their loans than they were before the emergency.  She warned the justices that ending the pause in payments without providing additional relief for lower-income borrowers would ""cause delinquency and default rates to spike above pre-pandemic levels.""  Prelogar rejected claims that the Department of Education had exceeded its authority under the major questions doctrine.  ""This is not a case where the agency relied on statutory language that is vague, cryptic, ancillary, or modest,"" she said, noting that the grant of authority is ""central"" to the HEROES ACT.   In addition, she said that neither the states nor the two individual plaintiffs behind the challenges have the standing to file suit. She warned that if the justices held otherwise, it could have ""startling implications"" going forward.  ""Virtually all federal actions -- from prosecuting crime to imposing taxes to managing property -- have some incidental effects on state finances,"" she said.  What the states are saying  As for the states, Nebraska Attorney General Michael T. Hilgers, who is also representing Missouri, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas and South Carolina, stressed that the Biden administration exceeded its authority by using the pandemic as a pretext to mask the true goal of fulfilling a campaign promise to erase student-loan debt.    ""Canceling hundreds of billions of dollars in student loans -- through a decree that extends to nearly all borrowers -- is a breathtaking assertion of power and a matter of great economic and political significance,"" triggering the major questions doctrine, Hilgers told the court. Such a cancellation power ""is the type of major question that courts presume Congress reserves for itself.""  Hilgers rejected the government's contention that the states can't show the harm necessary to get into court. In court papers he put forward multiple theories of standing that mostly revolve around the theory that the states will lose tax revenue.  A federal appeals court focused on one of the states behind the challenge, Missouri, and pointed to a state created entity called Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority (MOHELA) that has contracted with the federal Department of Education to service student loans. The court said that because Mohela will stop receiving servicing fees for loans discharged under the new plan, Mohela won't be able to fulfill its obligation to contribute a specified amount of money to the state treasury.   The appeals court ruled Mohela is akin to a state entity and therefore said that it satisfied the standing requirement.   Critics of that theory say that Mohela was established with financial and legal independence from the state of Missouri and the vast amount of its funds are segregated from state funds. They believe that for the purpose of the lawsuit, Mohela cannot be considered an ""arm of the state.""   The red states are supported by a group of former government officials including former Trump Attorney General William Barr, former Trump White House chief of saff Mick Mulvaney and others who say that Biden should not be able to forgive billions of dollars in student loan debt ""owed by 43 million borrowers who financed a college education with the benefit of tax payer-funded loans.""    ""This represents one of the largest expenditures in the nation's history, carried out in the face of clear congressional opposition,"" they wrote.

The 10 biggest revelations from Dominion's explosive Fox News legal filing,2023-02-28,"Fox News continues to be exposed for the dishonest organization that it is — this time, with the help of its billionaire owner. A Monday filing in Dominion Voting Systems' $1.6 billion lawsuit against the right-wing talk channel offered additional revelations — including the fact that Fox Corporation chair Rupert Murdoch admitted in a deposition that some of his top hosts were pushing election lies to his audience.  Murdoch rejected that Fox News, as an entity, endorsed former President Donald Trump's election lies. But Murdoch conceded that Sean Hannity, Jeanine Pirro, Maria Bartiromo, and former host Lou Dobbs promoted falsehoods about the 2020 presidential contest being stolen. ""Yes. They endorsed,"" Murdoch said, according to the filing, when asked about the hosts' promotion of false claims about the election. A version of this article first appeared in the ""Reliable Sources"" newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. ""I would have liked us to be stronger in denouncing it, in hindsight,"" the media mogul added at another point in the deposition. That's just one of the several revelations included in Monday's filing. Here are some additional highlights: ► In the wake of the election, Murdoch wrote in an email to the New York Post's Col Allan, describing election lies that Trump was pushing as ""bulls**t and damaging.""  ► Murdoch said it was ""wrong"" for Tucker Carlson to host conspiracy theorist Mike Lindell after the election. When asked why he continued to allow the MyPillow CEO to continue appearing on Fox News, Murdoch signaled it was a business decision. ""It is not red or blue, it is green,"" he said. That's a shocking admission from Murdoch about what actually guides coverage at Fox News. ► Behind the scenes, Paul Ryan repeatedly warned the Murdochs to stop allowing the spread of election lies. The former House speaker said that Fox News should ""move on from Donald Trump"" and ""stop spouting election lies."" Ryan told the Murdochs that many of those who thought the election had been stolen did so ""because they got a diet of information telling them the election was stolen from what they believe were credible sources."" He was not wrong.  ► Murdoch responded to one email from Ryan by telling him that Sean Hannity had ""been privately disgusted by Trump for weeks, but was scared to lose viewers."" In other words, Hannity, who always claims to say the same things on camera as when he's off camera, was not being up front with his loyal audience for fear they'd rebel against him.  ► Murdoch gave Jared Kushner ""confidential information"" about then-candidate Joe Biden's ads ""along with debate strategy"" in 2020, the filing said, offering Trump's son-in-law ""a preview of Biden's ads before they were public."" At most news organizations, this type of action would result in an investigation and disciplinary measures. ► Murdoch asked Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott to have Hannity say ""something supportive"" about Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham ahead of the 2020 election. Murdoch explained, ""We cannot lose the Senate if at all possible."" In other words, Murdoch was directing the head of his talk network to help the GOP. Again, this type of directive from an executive would be a major scandal at an actual news network. ► When Shepard Smith attacked the ""Trump administration's 'lies'"" on air, Rupert emailed Scott and Fox News president Jay Wallace calling it ""Over the top!"" and telling them, ""Need to chat to him."" In another instance, Lachlan Murdoch told Scott that then-correspondent Leland Vittert was ""smug and obnoxious"" when reporting from a Nov. 14 pro-Trump rally. Murdoch said the tone should be a ""celebration of the president."" ► Despite Fox accurately calling the race in Arizona for Biden, Murdoch suggested firing Bill Sammon, then the head of the network's Washington bureau. ""Maybe best to let Bill go right away,"" which would ""be a big message with Trump people"" the filing said. Sammon was later ""told the inevitable"" that day on Nov. 20, 2020. ► Murdoch said he ""suggested or urged"" the firing of host Lou Dobbs because he ""was an extremist,"" but allowed him to continue hosting a program at the network until after the election. Dominion argues that's because Dobbs was popular with Trump and his supporters and the network was fending off viewer defections to Newsmax. In totality, the documents continue to underscore that at its core, Fox News is not a news network. News networks work hard to deliver the truth to their viewers. These documents reveal that Fox News executives and hosts knew the truth and yet they peddled election lies to the audience. And when the handful of hosts and correspondents who have integrity at the channel tried to be honest with viewers, the highest levels of Fox News worked against them. The documents lay bare that the channel's business model is not based on informing its audience, but rather on feeding them content — even dangerous conspiracy theories — that keeps viewers happy and watching.  In response, Fox News said in a statement that Dominion's lawsuit ""has always been more about what will generate headlines than what can withstand legal and factual scrutiny."" The network added, ""Their summary judgment motion took an extreme, unsupported view of defamation law that would prevent journalists from basic reporting and their efforts to publicly smear Fox for covering and commenting on allegations by a sitting President of the United States should be recognized for what it is: a blatant violation of the First Amendment."" Top legal experts CNN has spoken with disagree with Fox News' assessment of Dominion's legal filings. But even if Dominion does not prevail in court, it has left a permanent stain on the channel and revealed its true motives.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.87, 'pos': 0.13, 'compound': 0.128}",45,39.0,0.13322222222222224,0.8045555555555556,0.06222222222222223,-0.277525,0.117,0.806,0.078,-0.9927,-12.488625,-31.677217307692295,261.0,-0.12136864868847623
Rupert Murdoch acknowledged that Fox News hosts endorsed false stolen election claims,2023-02-27,"Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of Fox Corporation, acknowledged in a deposition taken by Dominion Voting Systems that some Fox News hosts endorsed false claims that the 2020 election was stolen. Murdoch's remarks were made public in a legal filing as part of Dominion's $1.6 billion lawsuit against Fox News.  In his deposition, Murdoch rejected that the right-wing talk network as an entity endorsed former President Donald Trump's election lies. But Murdoch conceded that Sean Hannity, Jeanine Pirro, Maria Bartiromo, and former host Lou Dobbs promoted the falsehood about the presidential contest being stolen. ""Some of our commentators were endorsing it,,"" Murdoch said, according to the filing, when asked about the talk hosts' on-air positions about the election. ""I would have liked us to be stronger in denouncing it, in hindsight,"" he added. The filing also revealed that Murdoch referred to some of Trump's 2020 election lies as ""bulls**t and damaging."" Fox calls Dominion lawsuit 'dubious' In a Monday statement, Fox News assailed Dominion. ""Dominion's lawsuit has always been more about what will generate headlines than what can withstand legal and factual scrutiny,"" the network said, ""as illustrated by them now being forced to slash their fanciful damages demand by more than half a billion dollars after their own expert debunked its implausible claims."" ""Their summary judgment motion took an extreme, unsupported view of defamation law that would prevent journalists from basic reporting and their efforts to publicly smear Fox for covering and commenting on allegations by a sitting President of the United States should be recognized for what it is: a blatant violation of the First Amendment,"" the network added. Fox on Monday defended the actions of executives and hosts during the 2020 election in its own legal filings countering Dominion Voting Systems' lawsuit. Fox alleged that its hosts' on-air assertions about election fraud were taken out of context. Fox says it should not be held liable for the hosts' claims. ""Dominion's summary judgment motion is flawed from top to bottom and should be rejected in its entirety,"" lawyers for Fox News wrote in its filing Monday. Fox Corporation said in its filing that Dominion ""has produced zero evidentiary support for its dubious theory that high-level executives at Fox Corporation 'chose to publish and broadcast' or played a 'direct role in the creation and publication' of false election lies."" Fox hosts ridicule election fraud claims In another filing made public earlier this month, a trove of messages and emails from the most prominent stars and highest-ranking executives at Fox News showed they had privately ridiculed claims of election fraud in the 2020 election, despite the right-wing channel promoting lies about the presidential contest on its air. The messages showed that Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, and Laura Ingraham brutally mocked lies being pushed by former President Donald Trump's camp asserting that the election was rigged. The court filings have offered the most vivid picture to date of the chaos that transpired behind the scenes at Fox News after Trump lost the election and viewers rebelled against the right-wing channel for accurately calling the contest in Biden's favor. Top legal experts told CNN after last week's filing that Dominion's legal position appeared strong. ""It's a major blow,"" renowned First Amendment attorney Floyd Abrams said of Dominion's motion for a summary judgment, adding that the ""recent revelations certainly put Fox in a more precarious situation"" in defending against the lawsuit on First Amendment grounds. Rebecca Tushnet, the Frank Stanton Professor of First Amendment Law at Harvard Law School, described Dominion's evidence as a ""very strong"" filing that ""clearly lays out the difference between what Fox was saying publicly and what top people at Fox were privately admitting."" Tushnet said that in her years of practicing and teaching law, she had never seen such damning evidence collected in the pre-trial phase of a defamation suit. ""I don't recall anything comparable to this,"" Tushnet said. ""Donald Trump seems to be very good at generating unprecedented situations."" Murdoch said it was 'wrong' for Tucker Carlson to host election conspiracy theorist Mike Lindell In his deposition, Murdoch also said that it was ""wrong"" for Fox's Tucker Carlson to have hosted election conspiracy theorist Mike Lindell on his program following the presidential election. Murdoch testified it was ""wrong for Tucker to host Mike Lindell to repeat those allegations against Dominion on January 26th, 2021,"" the documents said. When asked why he continued to allow Lindell, the MyPillow CEO, to make election fraud claims on Fox News, Murdoch said it was a business decision. ""It is not red or blue, it is green,"" Murdoch replied, according to the court documents. ""The man is on every night. Pays us a lot of money..."" Murdoch said. ""At first you think it's comic, and then you get bored and irritated."" Murdoch also said he could have stopped Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell, former lawyers for President Trump and his campaign who alleged election fraud, from appearing on the network's programs, the filing said. ""I could have. But I didn't,"" Murdoch said. Paul Ryan warned Murdochs, Fox to stop spreading false election narratives Court documents Monday showed that Paul Ryan repeatedly warned Murdoch and Fox News of the dangerous effects that discussing false election fraud narratives on air would have with viewers. Ryan, the former House speaker and a Fox Corporation board member, repeatedly told Rupert and Fox Corporation CEO Lachlan Murdoch that the company ""should not be spreading conspiracy theories.""  On at least one occasion, Ryan advised the Murdochs that the company should ""move on from Donald Trump and stop spouting election lies."" During this time, Ryan told the Murdochs that many of those who thought the election had been stolen did so ""because they got a diet of information telling them the election was stolen from what they believe were credible sources.""  ""The sooner we can put down the echoes of falsehoods from our side, the faster we can get onto principled loyal opposition,"" Ryan wrote to Rupert. ""I truly hope our contributors, along with Tucker, Laura, and Sean get that and execute."" Rupert responded to Ryan, noting that ""everything changed"" following the events of January 6, 2021, and asked the former speaker turned Fox executive for suggestions for contributors. Murdoch gave Kushner 'confidential information' about Biden ads Also revealed in Dominion's filing, Rupert Murdoch gave Jared Kushner, son-in-law of former President Donald Trump, ""confidential information about [President Joe] Biden's ads, along with debate strategy"" in 2020, ""providing Kushner a preview of Biden's ads before they were public,"" the court filing states. Murdoch, under oath, also said that on election night, Kushner called him upset about the media's coverage of the election that was ultimately called for Biden. Murdoch testified that Kushner said, ""this is terrible"" and Murdoch could ""hear Trump's voice in the background shouting."" Murdoch said he replied, ""Well, the numbers are the numbers."" According to the filing, Murdoch said that he believed no fraud had occurred in the election. ""Yes. I mean, we thought everything was on the up-and-up. I think that was shown when we announced Arizona,"" Murdoch said, referring to Fox News' projection on election night that Joe Biden would win the critical battleground state. A Kushner spokesperson did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment. - CNN's Liam Reilly and Nicki Brown contributed to this report","{'neg': 0.211, 'neu': 0.658, 'pos': 0.132, 'compound': -0.296}",51,40.0,0.14155555555555555,0.8164444444444444,0.04188888888888889,-0.44459999999999994,0.138,0.795,0.068,-0.9987,-22.674599999999998,-27.554517307692294,251.0,-0.10977895341710077
Covid 'lab leak theory': What we've learned,2023-02-27,"An updated intelligence assessment about the origins of the Covid-19 virus has reopened the long-simmering and unsolved debate about how the virus came to be -- and will fuel a new committee House Republicans have created to investigate the issue. While scientists still predominantly believe the virus occurred naturally in animals and spread to humans in an outbreak at a market in Wuhan, China, the US Department of Energy's Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence is now the second tentacle of the US government intelligence apparatus, along with the FBI, that endorses the ""lab leak theory"" -- the minority view that the virus occurred as a result of work in a Chinese lab. The DOE office is one of 18 government agencies that make up the intelligence community, which are under the umbrella of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Most of the intelligence community remains either split or leaning toward the natural occurrence theory that scientific investigations have concluded as most likely. But without conclusive evidence, no one has been able to reject the lab leak theory entirely. The theory has been the subject of much focus by Republican lawmakers, and polling in 2021 suggested a majority of Americans believe the Chinese government had something to do with the origins of the virus. Asked whether they believe the virus originated from a laboratory leak in China or from human contact with an infected animal, about half (52%) said that they believed a lab leak was responsible. Now in the House majority, Republicans have formed a special subcommittee of the House Oversight Committee specifically to investigate, among other things, China's role in the early spread of the virus and US government dollars that helped fund some research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the research facility at the center of the lab leak theory. Lack of answers about the origins of Covid-19 and an accumulation of circumstantial evidence have led some scientists, the Biden administration and the World Health Organization to argue that the lab leak theory needs more study. If only China was cooperating. US lawmakers who have pushed the lab leak theory seized on reporting about the new Department of Energy assessment, although the details of what led to the assessment are not yet public. ""I'm pleased the Department of Energy has finally reached the same conclusion that I had already come to,"" Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri demanded more information about the Department of Energy's assessment and promised to push for more such reports to be declassified. Still a minority view  The change in opinion by the Energy Department's intelligence office is far from a total backing of the ""lab leak"" theory. For starters, the conclusion was reached only with ""low confidence,"" as opposed to medium or high confidence. CNN's Jeremy Herb and Natasha Bertrand explain the confidence levels: Intelligence agencies can make assessments with either low, medium or high confidence. A low confidence assessment generally means that the information obtained is not reliable enough or is too fragmented to make a more definitive analytic judgment or that there is not enough information available to draw a more robust conclusion. It's not clear what exactly changed things for the officials involved in the assessment for the Department of Energy, but whatever it was has not convinced the majority of intelligence agencies. According to a two-page list of takeaways from the initial 2021 intelligence community review of Covid-19 origins ordered by President Joe Biden, four components of the intelligence community and the National Intelligence Council believed, like most scientists, that ""natural exposure"" caused the virus. Three elements of the intelligence community did not believe there was enough evidence to make a determination. And one agency, which CNN has reported is the FBI, had medium confidence in the lab leak theory. There is agreement on some key points While the intelligence community remains very much split on what led to the virus, they were completely aligned on three key points when they first issued a two-page unclassified report in 2021: The virus was not developed as a biological weapon.
Most of the agencies believe the virus was not genetically engineered. (Two agencies did not think there was sufficient evidence to make an assessment either way.)
Chinese officials did not have ""foreknowledge of the virus"" before the initial outbreak. Something everyone seems to agree on is that China has not been cooperative in figuring out how the virus evolved. Previous investigations have not answered the question CNN's chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta did a long-form report in 2021 about all of the available evidence and talked to multiple people who had assessed the available evidence. A. Chris Gajilan has an extensive report on what is to be learned from all of that, and how a key WHO assessment was flawed due to a lack of cooperation from the Chinese government. Dr. Anthony Fauci -- the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases whom Republicans have told they will call before Congress to testify about the origins of the disease -- has consistently repeated he believes the virus most likely occurred naturally, since other, similar viruses have evolved that way.  But he has been careful to add that it's important to keep an ""open mind"" about the lab leak possibility.   An open and high-level commission could help While there are multiple theories about how it happened, there is also a realization that we may never know. ""Unfortunately, I don't think that we will ever get a real answer,"" CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen said Monday morning. He argued the US government should get ahead of politically divisive theories and empanel a bipartisan group to write a definitive and public report. ""We have never had a Covid commission like the 9/11 Commission,"" he said. ""I think we desperately need it. Because more Americans have died of Covid than have died in every American war since the American Revolution, which is an astonishing number; that is a major national security issue."" China should 'be more honest' The State Department renewed its criticism of China's openness about the origins of the virus on Monday. ""If we're going to do something to strengthen the World Health Organization, then we're going to have to push China to be more active in it, and to of course, be more honest about what happened three years ago in Wuhan with the origin of the Covid-19 crisis,"" US Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns told reporters. State Department spokesman Ned Price, in separate comments to reporters, accused China of ""blocking from the beginning international investigators and members of the global health community from accessing information that they need to understand the origins of Covid-19."" 'Regardless, we know the next step' CNN's John King asked Dr. Megan Ranney, deputy dean of the School of Public Health at Brown University, why it matters, at this point, where the virus came from. Ranney argued that if the virus came from a lab leak, it means the world needs better biosecurity protocols.  If the virus came from animal-to-human transmission, we need to be able to respond more quickly to outbreaks. ""Regardless, we know the next step,"" Ranney said. ""While we're focusing on where Covid-19 started, we're not spending time about how to keep America from ever having to go through the last three years again.""  'The evidence isn't there' King also talked to Beth Sanner, the former deputy director of national intelligence for mission integration during the Trump administration, about the report. ""If you want to blame somebody in terms of how this all unfolded, it's very clear that China hid this, did not move quickly enough, and now is blocking investigation,"" she said. But she said it's important to look at the entire analysis of the intelligence community, which is based on evidence. And the evidence does not conclusively point to any one theory. ""We don't just take information or just take a feeling and turn it into analysis,"" she said. ""We're actually doing a rigorous process and that's why we don't know yet. The evidence isn't there.""","{'neg': 0.286, 'neu': 0.714, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.34}",51,41.0,0.0,0.893,0.107,0.4767,0.077,0.805,0.118,0.9958,24.311700000000002,29.334582692307706,264.0,0.11111584353146858
Opinion: Scott Adams has only himself to blame for Dilbert's troubles,2023-02-27,"Scott Adams -- creator of the once popular ""Dilbert"" comic strip that lampoons corporate culture -- apparently doesn't like being held accountable for his recent undeniably racist rant in which he called Black Americans a ""hate group"" and urged White people to ""get the hell away"" from them.  On Saturday, in response to the fierce backlash over his remarks after hundreds of newspapers dropped his comic strip, Adams whined about being targeted for ""cancellation.""  In reality, this is not ""cancel culture,"" but ""consequence culture"" where people are rightly held accountable for their words and actions.  Adams' bigoted diatribe was posted Wednesday on his YouTube show, ""Real Coffee with Scott Adams."" The Trump-supporting cartoonist cited a poll by Rasmussen, a conservative polling company, that claimed 53% of the Black Americans who were surveyed agreed with the statement, ""It's OK to be White."" If that phrase strikes you as odd, that may not be surprising. As the Anti-Defamation League has noted, the statement was made popular in the White supremacist movement as a way to troll liberals. Unexplained, as of yet, is why Rasmussen used a White supremacist-coined phrase in their poll. The poll results caused Adams to hysterically exclaim that, ""If nearly half of all Blacks are not OK with White people...that's a hate group."" In fact, the polling company said that 26% of Black Americans agreed with that view.   Adams added about Blacks, ""I don't want to have anything to do with them."" And he went even further: ""I don't think it makes any sense as a white citizen of America to try to help Black citizens anymore...There's no longer a rational impulse. So, I'm going to back off on being helpful to Black America because it doesn't seem like it pays off.""  He didn't elaborate about what kind of so-called help he provided to Black Americans in the past. The cartoonist then offered a piece of advice to his fellow White Americans: ""I would say, based on the current way things are going, the best advice I would give to White people is to get the hell away from Black people, just get the f**k away...because there is no fixing this.""   I imagine that the ghosts of segregationists were cheering this sentiment. For its part, Rasmussen wrote in a tweet on Friday, ""Astroturf has finally discovered our 'Ok to be White?' poll, inspired by the @ADL literally defining the wording of the question as 'hate speech',"" --  adding a clown emoji in the message. It's not surprising  that a broad cross-section of newspapers in this country no longer want to be associated with Adams. The Washington Post, Houston Chronicle and the USA Today Network that includes more than 300 local media outlets in 43 states were among the publications announcing they would no longer be running Dilbert. In response to the backlash, Adams first defended his comments by tweeting that he was only ""advising people to avoid hate."" It wasn't long however before he claimed he was being made a victim for speaking his mind. ""By Monday, I should be mostly canceled,"" he said on Saturday, adding, ""My reputation for the rest of my life is destroyed. You can't come back from this."" Aww, poor multi-millionaire Adams. He is being held accountable for his words -- which as of now he has not apologized for, but instead defended.  This is not the first time Adams has invoked White victimhood for his own failings and unfairly targeted Black Americans. In June 2020, Adams cited the TV network UPN's cancellation of his ""Dilbert"" animated primetime TV series by tweeting, ""I lost my TV show for being white when UPN decided it would focus on an African American audience. That was the third job I lost for being white.""  In reality -- as Variety reported -- the show was canceled because of a huge drop in ratings. Adams is just a prime example of the era we live in, a time when some people will say racist or bigoted remarks and then play the victim card,  alleging that they have been victimized by ""cancel culture"" in hopes of silencing their critics.   In the minds of people like him, freedom of expression means being free to spew all the hate-filled garbage they want and in response, requiring the rest of us to bite our tongues. But that's not how free speech works. People will and should push back against bigotry.  In this case, Adams was not just criticized by those offended by his vile views. Publications he's been associated with for years no longer want anything to do with him.  This is what consequence culture looks like. If you don't like the consequences, then don't spew hate.

Rep. Elissa Slotkin entering race to succeed retiring Michigan Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow,2023-02-27,"Michigan Rep. Elissa Slotkin is entering the race to replace retiring Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow, with a campaign launch video on her YouTube page and a US Senate campaign website up. The announcement makes Slotkin the first Democrat to officially declare a bid in what is likely to be among the most competitive and expensive Senate contests in 2024.  In the three-minute-long video, Slotkin talks about growing up in Michigan, entering public service after 9/11 and going on to work for the CIA.   ""Look, we all know America is going through something right now. We seem to be living crisis to crisis. But there are certain things that should be really simple,"" Slotkin says in the video. ""This is why I'm running for the United States Senate. We need a new generation of leaders that thinks differently, works harder, and never forgets that we are public servants."" Slotkin won reelection to the US House in one of Michigan's top battleground districts in 2022. According to her most recent FEC filing, Slotkin had about $130,000 in her campaign account at the end of 2022.  Michigan's Senate seat is crucial for Democrats. The party is defending 23 of the 34 Senate seats up for reelection next year, including three seats in states that backed former President Donald Trump by at least 8 points in 2020: West Virginia, Montana and Ohio. Besides Michigan, the party is also defending seats in other battleground states such as Arizona, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Other potential candidates for the seat include Republican Reps. Bill Huizenga and John James, Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell, and Democratic state Sen. Mallory McMorrow, who drew national attention last year in a floor speech pushing back against anti-LGBTQ attacks from a Republican colleague. James lost a closer-than-expected race to Stabenow in 2018 and then narrowly lost a bid for the state's other Senate seat in 2020, before winning election to the House in November from a swing seat north of Detroit. Several other Democrats who have been considered potential candidates, such as Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Rep. Dan Kildee, have said they are not running.

New assessment on the origins of Covid-19 adds to the confusion,2023-02-27,"""We want to know what led to this, so we can hopefully try and prevent something similar from happening in the future."" Those words, from Dr. David Relman, an infectious disease expert and microbiologist at Stanford University, reflected the national conversation around the origins of Covid-19 in 2021.  Did it come from a lab? Was it a zoonotic transfer? Something else? Surely, with time, an answer would become clear.  But now, three years removed from the start of a pandemic that is still disrupting daily life, an assessment from the US Energy Department is only adding to the confusion about what really happened in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. The department has assessed that the Covid-19 pandemic most likely emerged from a laboratory leak in China, according to a newly updated classified intelligence report first reported by The Wall Street Journal on Sunday. Yet two sources said that the department assessed in the intelligence report that it had ""low confidence"" that the coronavirus accidentally escaped from a lab in Wuhan, CNN's Jeremy Herb and Natasha Bertrand reported. Intelligence agencies can make assessments with either low, medium or high confidence; and a low confidence assessment generally means that the information obtained is not reliable enough or is too fragmented to make a more definitive analytic judgment or that there is not enough information available to draw a more robust conclusion. National security adviser Jake Sullivan acknowledged on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday that the intelligence community is divided on the matter, while noting that President Joe Biden has put resources into getting to the bottom of the origin question. The intelligence community has been split on the matter for years. In 2021, the intelligence community declassified a report that showed four agencies in the intelligence community had assessed with low confidence that the virus likely jumped from animals to humans naturally in the wild. One assessed with moderate confidence that the pandemic was the result of a laboratory accident. Three other intelligence community elements were unable to coalesce around either explanation without additional information, the community's report said. Lab leak theory gains traction For the better part of 2020, advocates of the lab leak theory had to fight against claims they were being xenophobic or racist — in part thanks to anti-Chinese rhetoric from then-President Donald Trump, who embraced the theory. An inquiry launched by Trump's State Department, which sought to investigate whether China's biological weapons program could have had a greater role in the pandemic's origin in Wuhan, was shut down early on in the Biden administration. A letter from public health experts published in February 2020 in The Lancet, an influential scientific journal, also set the tone early by declaring the virus to have a natural origin. But the lab leak theory has gained more traction with time, especially following reports that the intelligence community found evidence that researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology fell seriously ill with a mysterious virus in November 2019 -- although it's not clear whether they contracted Covid-19 and no further evidence has emerged to corroborate that report.  By July 2021, senior Biden administration officials overseeing an intelligence review into the origins believed that the lab leak theory was at least as credible as the possibility that the virus emerged naturally in the wild -- a dramatic shift from a year earlier, when Democrats publicly downplayed such an idea. 'Not a definitive answer'  The latest intelligence assessment was provided to Congress as Republicans on Capitol Hill have been pushing for further investigation into the theory, while accusing the Biden administration of playing down its possibility. House Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul said Sunday he was ""pleased"" the Energy Department ""has finally reached the same conclusion that I had already come to."" (The Texas Republican had released a 2021 report that concluded that ""the preponderance of the evidence"" showed the pandemic originated with a leak from the Wuhan lab.) ""Now is the time for the entire Biden administration to join the Department of Energy, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the majority of Americans by publicly concluding what common sense told us at the start -- the COVID-19 pandemic originated from a lab leak in Wuhan, China,"" McCaul said in a statement. Sullivan said Sunday that Biden had directed the national laboratories, which are part of the Department of Energy, to be brought into the assessment.   ""Right now, there is not a definitive answer that has emerged from the intelligence community on this question,"" Sullivan told CNN's Dana Bash. ""Some elements of the intelligence community have reached conclusions on one side, some on the other. A number of them have said they just don't have enough information to be sure."" So where does that leave us? Not far from where we started.  Past pandemics have emerged from natural transmission through animals, and it often takes months or years to discover the host that the virus passed through as it adapted to infect humans. In some cases, as in Ebola, the original natural source has never been identified. And it's been more than 40 years since the first cases of Ebola. So why does it matter where Covid-19 came from? As Relman, the Stanford microbiologist, previously noted to CNN, finding the answer can help prevent the next pandemic.","{'neg': 0.18, 'neu': 0.82, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.296}",33,44.0,0.141,0.734,0.125,-0.23405,0.066,0.776,0.157,0.9981,-7.72365,19.638750000000012,188.0,0.10446143617021283
GOP grapples with how to control Trump -- again,2023-02-27,"GOP leaders are sending warnings that they want former President Donald Trump to play by the rules and put his party above his own interests as he embarks on a third campaign -- that is, to behave in a way he rarely, if ever, has before. Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel gave the clearest sign yet on CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday that 2024 GOP White House candidates will have to pledge to back the party's presidential nominee if it isn't them -- or risk being banned from the debate stage. ""I think it's kind of a no-brainer, right?"" McDaniel told Dana Bash, adding that formal criteria haven't yet been established for the first debate in August. ""If you're going to be on the Republican National Committee debate stage asking voters to support you, you should say, 'I'm going to support the voters and who they choose as the nominee,'"" McDaniel added. The former president, who signed a loyalty pledge in 2015, responded with his typical hubris on Sunday, despite recent polling showing that enthusiasm for him among the GOP isn't what it used to be. ""President Trump will support the Republican nominee because it will be him,"" a campaign spokesperson told CNN in response to McDaniel's prediction there'd be a loyalty pledge required of candidates. Trump has already said that whether he would back someone other than himself as the 2024 Republican nominee would depend on who the candidate was. Given that he is attacking his potential primary rivals, especially high-flying Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, the potential for new party splits is growing. Ever since Trump took control of the GOP with his 2016 nomination and victory, the party has almost always capitulated to his unruly instincts and crushing of rules and conventions -- most notoriously appeasing his extremism during two impeachments. Many GOP lawmakers amplified his false claims of electoral fraud in the 2020 presidential election and whitewashed his role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection. Yet Trump's intervention in last year's midterm elections, when many of his election-denying acolytes lost in swing states and helped to quell a Republican red wave, highlighted how his own priorities may diverge from his party's. Some Republican leaders blame Trump and the way he alienates more moderate, suburban voters for the party's disappointing performances when they lost the House in 2018, the Senate and White House in 2020 and fell short of expectations in 2022, even though they flipped the House. As a result, some top GOP donors and opinion formers have argued that it's time for the party to move on from a candidate who is radioactive with many voters and who could thwart their chances of defeating President Joe Biden in an expected reelection bid. It remains to be seen if this view is shared among Trump's longtime base. Questions about whether Trump would support DeSantis as nominee -- or anyone else who might beat him -- stemmed from a radio interview with Hugh Hewitt earlier this month. ""It would depend. I would give you the same answer I gave in 2016 during the debate. ... It would have to depend on who the nominee was,"" Trump said.  It would be a nightmare scenario for the GOP if Trump were to lose the party's nominating contest next year but spend the general election railing against the party's presidential pick. Even small defections among Trump's devoted grassroots political base could be critical in the kind of swing state races that decided the last two presidential elections.  Trump rarely plays by the rules  Trump acts as if he is entitled to his third consecutive spot at the top of the Republican Party's presidential ticket. But that assumption will face a new test this week when DeSantis, whom Trump has already accused of disloyalty for considering a White House run, promotes and releases a new book in a rite of passage for potential presidential candidates.  Trump has also lashed out at Nikki Haley, who served as his ambassador to the United Nations and has launched a 2024 bid rooted in calls for a new generation of American political leadership. Both Trump and Haley are scheduled to speak at this week's Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington, DC. DeSantis, meanwhile, is scheduled to attend events in Texas and California.  While requiring debate candidates to sign a pledge to support the nominee would be a show of party unity and would, in effect, be an attempt to box Trump in, it would hardly be enforceable should the ex-president not win the nomination. Given that Trump already falsely claimed the 2020 general election, which he lost fair and square, was marred by voter fraud, it's hardly far-fetched to believe he may trash any nomination process that he doesn't win. But McDaniel said on CNN that she was sure that all the candidates would sign such a pledge, noting Trump had signed on in the 2016 race and raising the leverage that the party has in getting all of the candidates on board. ""I think they all want to be on the debate stage. I think President Trump would like to be on the debate stage. That's what he likes to do,"" McDaniel told Bash. The RNC head, who just won her own contested reelection, also warned that the GOP has lost big races in the midterms ""because of Republicans refusing to support other Republicans. And unless we fix this in our party, unless we start coming together, we will not win in 2024."" McDaniel may also have a problem beyond Trump, since some possible GOP 2024 contenders have warned that following his role in inciting a mob attack on Congress in one of the most damaging blows to US democracy in modern times, the ex-president is no longer fit to carry the party's banner or for the presidency. Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson said on CBS this month that Trump had ""disqualified himself and should not serve our country again as a result of what happened"" on January 6, 2021. But Hutchinson did not say whether he would decline to endorse Trump if he were the nominee. Another possible anti-Trump candidate, former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, suggested to Hewitt this month that he would support the ex-president if he was the party's nominee but later said on Twitter, ""Trump won't commit to supporting the Republican nominee, and I won't commit to supporting him."" Signs of vulnerability in Trump's campaign  One reason why the question of whether Trump would endorse a nominee other than himself in 2024 is so topical is because of some early signs that the former president might not have quite the hold on his party as he once did. His campaign hasn't exactly caught fire since he launched it last fall. Some recent polls, while too far out from primary voting to be decisive, suggest that DeSantis is closely matched with Trump -- even if other candidates like Haley and potential candidates like ex-Vice President Mike Pence trail in single figures. After his bumper reelection win in Florida in November, DeSantis is seen by some party figures as representative of Trump's populist, cultural and ""America First"" principles without the indiscipline and scandal that follows the ex-president. The Florida governor has adopted Trump's pugilistic partisan style, telling Fox News host Mark Levin on Sunday that he had made ""the Democratic Party in our state, basically, a rotten carcass on the side of the street."" It remains a question, however, how DeSantis would stand up to Trump's searing attacks on a debate stage. And many once vaunted candidates -- like former Govs. Jeb Bush of Florida and Scott Walker of Wisconsin -- have looked strong in theory, only to see their campaigns flame out when they hit the trail. Still, McDaniel's message on Sunday shows the depth of party concern that an untamed Trump could again severely impair the Republican Party's hopes of winning the White House and control of Congress.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",49,45.0,0.06431034482758621,0.8494827586206898,0.0863103448275862,0.11260400000000002,0.082,0.821,0.098,0.9471,5.517596000000001,47.83094600000001,186.0,0.25715562365591405
RNC chair says requiring loyalty pledge for participation in GOP presidential debates is a 'no-brainer',2023-02-26,"Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said Sunday that she expects 2024 GOP presidential contenders will have to sign a pledge to back the party's ultimate nominee in order to participate in primary debates.  ""We haven't put the criteria out, but I expect a pledge will be part of it. It was part of 2016. I think it's kind of a no-brainer, right? If you're going to be on the Republican National Committee debate stage asking voters to support you, you should say, 'I'm going to support the voters and who they choose as the nominee,'"" McDaniel told CNN's Dana Bash on ""State of the Union"" in her first interview since winning a contentious race for a fourth term as RNC chairwoman.  ""As RNC chair, if I said I wouldn't support the Republican nominee, I would be removed from office,"" she said.  Asked if there would be other requirements for candidates to get onto the debate stage, McDaniel said, ""I think there should be a threshold.""  ""You want to make sure you have people on the debate stage who are running for president. We don't want people who are running for book deals, or media contracts, or Cabinet positions,"" she said.  Republicans who have launched presidential bids include former President Donald Trump, former US ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, but many more are signaling interest. Among them are Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former Vice President Mike Pence, and Mike Pompeo, Trump's former secretary of state. A Trump campaign spokesperson told CNN later Sunday in response to McDaniel's pledge expectation that ""President Trump will support the Republican nominee because it will be him."" Earlier this month, Trump hesitated when asked if he would support the eventual GOP nominee if it were not him. ""It would depend,"" the former president told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt during an interview on radio show. ""It would have to depend on who the nominee was."" DeSantis called for ""some new blood in the RNC"" prior to McDaniel's win in January, while offering praise for Harmeet Dhillon, one of her opponents for the chair position. Asked by Bash if she had spoken to the Florida governor since then, McDaniel said, ""Ron and I have a good relationship. And we're going to work well together,"" adding that she campaigned with DeSantis' wife, Casey, ""quite a bit"" in the last election.  The primary is still in its early stages, and it could take months before the field fully rounds into form and candidates make more than occasional visits to states such as Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, which will kick off the GOP's nominating process. ""We can't be attacking each other so much that we lose sight of: We have to beat the Democrats. We have to beat Joe Biden in 2024. And we may have divisive primaries and differences of opinions, but in the end we have to settle those to win the big picture, which is governing our country and doing right by the American people,"" McDaniel said Sunday, leaning on the message of unity she put forward in her campaign for another term atop the RNC. Asked Sunday about compelling certain White House hopefuls who have broken with party leaders -- such as former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson -- to sign a loyalty pledge, McDaniel offered: ""I think you support the voters."" ""I am Mitt Romney's niece and I was appointed to the RNC by Donald Trump. And I would support both of them ... if they were the nominee of our party over Joe Biden. But I don't know if they would support each other,"" she said.  McDaniel was also asked about the decision by Republicans in her home state of Michigan to choose Kristina Karamo as state party chair. Karamo has falsely claimed that Trump won the state in the 2020 election, and she has yet to concede her loss in last year's race for Michigan secretary of state.  ""I don't know her very well. And I wasn't at this recent convention,"" said McDaniel, herself a former Michigan GOP chair. ""But I'm committed to Michigan. It's my state."" ""We have a Senate seat. We have House seats. I love our great state. And the RNC is absolutely committed to Michigan,"" she said.  This story has been updated with additional reaction.

Opinion: Tim Scott's pitch to Republicans offers more than the usual red meat,2023-02-26,"Don't underestimate Tim Scott.  This week, the South Carolina Republican Senator embarked on the obligatory Iowa listening tour that precedes a possible presidential campaign. He offered up a well-scripted speech in Des Moines and then led the Polk County Lincoln Day dinner, testing out the themes that could define a candidacy.  If you glanced at the headlines, you might think that he was selling a warmed over form of Trump's ""combative vision,"" served with a side order of DeSantis' bitter culture war assaults.  That would be a mistake. Because if you actually listened to Scott's speeches, you'd hear a very different pitch to voters. ""For America to be at our best, we have to work together,"" Scott said. ""We must come together on a common ground, built on common sense."" Yes, Tim Scott is an unapologetic conservative. He is a person whose religious faith genuinely defines his personal journey and his politics. That may or may not be your policy preference. But his vision is fundamentally optimistic, a rebuke to grievance politics on the left and (implicitly) the right.   He is not fanning the flames of fear about ""American carnage."" He is not wielding the American flag as a weapon to bludgeon people who look different than him. Amid a wave of strategically induced CRT panic, he is also not trying to whitewash American history to pretend it is an unadulterated story of perfection.  At the Lincoln Day dinner, he told the story of how his beloved grandfather, born in 1921, was taught to step aside on the sidewalk to let a white man pass and never make eye contact. This was deep in the Jim Crow South. ""So when I talk about our history, I'm not whitewashing it,"" Scott said. But he added that his grandfather told him ""you can be bitter -- or you can be better. I chose better.""  As the only Black Republican Senator, Scott sees his remarkable rise as evidence of American exceptionalism and our success in forming a more perfect union. And as inherently unique as it is, Scott's story is not one that can simply be dismissed out of hand. But he is ready to have his patriotism attacked.   ""For those of you on the left, you can call me a prop, you can call me a token, you can call me the N-word, you can question my Blackness, you can even call me 'Uncle Tim.' Just understand: Your words are no match for my evidence. The truth of my life disproves your lies."" That's a good line. It's also a hard truth rooted in his personal experience. And he is unsparing in his belief that activists try to use our nation's historic mistakes as a wedge to ""bring more power and more resources to their progressive agenda.""  You can contest this all day long with stats and facts about systemic racism and its expression in everything from police abuse to housing. Scott might even agree when it comes to certain policies. But his place on the stage as a Black Republican US Senator preaching the need for national unity to achieve national greatness goes a long way toward repudiating the white identity politics that fueled much of Trump's rise.  To be sure, he is still trying to appeal to a party that fell under Trump's spell -- and Scott does go too far with the play-to-the-base red meat for my taste at times.  For example, his talk of how left-wing Democrats are deliberately trying to ""destroy America"" fundamentally undercuts his overall rhetoric about the need to unite America. And he is part of the conservative crew that is dancing around the outright denunciation of Donald Trump's attempt to overturn an election on the basis of a lie -- a stance that will look as cowardly in the future as it may look pragmatic now, from the perspective of someone running for president as a Republican. But trying to slap a cynical Trump-derivative bumper sticker on Tim Scott does him a disservice. Because Scott's optimistic pitch for possible presidential campaign is evidence that there is a lane outside of Trump, Trump Lite and Never Trump. It's evidence of evolution beyond an obsession with identity politics and the grievance industrial complex. And that's good for the future of Republican Party and good for the republic.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",39,47.0,0.085,0.8479999999999999,0.06716666666666667,-0.13131999999999996,0.09,0.799,0.111,0.9522,-5.121479999999998,13.84861600000001,173.0,0.08004980346820816
Opinion: The message Biden sent to Putin,2023-02-26,"In April 1917, an impatient revolutionary leader stepped onto a train in Zurich, beginning an 8-day journey home to St. Petersburg. Vladimir Lenin couldn't wait to intervene in the turmoil that followed the abdication of Russia's Tsar Nicholas II.  German authorities were happy to let the train carry Lenin and his supporters through their nation, hoping the revolutionaries would further destabilize the shaky government of their wartime enemy. And they did. Last weekend, a President of the United States secretly boarded a European train and made history of a different kind -- aiming to inspire. And he did.  Joe Biden, the onetime Amtrak commuter who now mostly travels by plane and helicopter, embarked from a station in eastern Poland for the nearly 10-hour trip to Kyiv, seated in a rail car paneled in dark wood. There he met with President Volodymyr Zelensky, and proclaimed that despite Russia's invasion last Feb. 24, ""One year later, Kyiv stands. And Ukraine stands. Democracy stands."" As Frida Ghitis wrote, ""The risky trip on Monday to an active war zone was not just a powerful symbol of American support, it was a shot in the arm to a population that has endured Russia's devastating attacks on civilian apartment blocks, hospitals, schools and the power stations that provide heat and electricity."" ""Who could have imagined in 2022, when Ukraine's situation looked so hopeless that the United States offered to evacuate Zelensky -- and he famously refused -- that a year later the Ukrainian people would have put up such a strong resistance, and the West would have given so much support for their efforts? And that instead of (Russian President Vladimir) Putin having a military parade in Kyiv, it would be Biden walking in the Ukrainian capital's streets, arriving at the ornate Mariinsky Palace, the official residence of the Ukrainian President?"" In the conservative National Review, Mark Antonio Wright observed, ""This trip took guts...The moment reminds me not so much of Presidents Bush, Obama, and Trump flying unannounced to Iraq or Afghanistan, but of President Roosevelt's wartime travels across the Atlantic. Make no mistake, there was risk involved in this trip. Traveling to the capital of a nation fighting a shooting war with a great power, the U.S. had no way to choreograph with exactitude the circumstances of his travel or arrival. Neither the U.S. nor Ukraine has total control of the airspace. Neither the U.S. nor Ukraine could guarantee Biden's security on the ground."" Jill Filipovic observed that ""a year into Putin's war, it's clear that he is willing to sacrifice untold lives to cement his power and Russia's imperial interests."" She pointed out the Russian president's effort to ally with culture warriors by attacking the west's openness to same-sex marriage, among other progressive values.   ""Americans have a choice, both at home and abroad: Do we stand with autocrats and their small, hateful view of the world? Or do we stand for freedom and democracy -- including the obligation to live among those whose views you don't agree with and whose choices you wouldn't make yourself?"" ""The decision, and the stakes, couldn't be clearer,"" Filipovic wrote. Ohio's train Biden's critics cited another train --  the one that derailed Feb. 3 in East Palestine, Ohio -- to try to take the shine off his historic trip.  The derailment led to the release and burning of vinyl chloride and stirred fears among residents that their health and community were being endangered.  ""Three weeks after the derailment of a freight train carrying hazardous chemical ignited a days-long fire in their town, residents of East Palestine are still waiting for answers,"" wrote Ericka L. Copeland, the chapter director of Sierra Club Ohio. ""The concerns of environmental groups like ours are focused on the ongoing impacts to the East Palestine community, where people continue to report odors and immediate health problems, chemical residues remain on soils and surfaces, and clean-up and soil removal is ongoing."" A federal regulator called the derailment ""100% preventable."" Former President Donald Trump visited the site Wednesday and said, ""You have a president going to Ukraine and you have people in Ohio that are in desperate need of help.""  The former president didn't mention his own administration's deregulation efforts, including dropping a rail safety rule instituted by the Obama administration, although experts said it probably wouldn't have applied to the derailment. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who went to East Palestine Thursday, said he regretted not speaking out sooner on the derailment.  Julian Zelizer wrote that ""the president needs to reassure the residents of East Palestine and make sure that the town has all the resources it needs for a comprehensive cleanup while calling for the establishment of safety regulations that can diminish the chances of this kind of accident from happening again.""  Still, he noted, the president ""has plenty to work with to dispute the kind of claims being leveled by a Republican Party that has focused much more on supply side tax cuts, deregulation, and culture wars than on addressing the kind of crucial issues to emerge through the situation in East Palestine."" Flying with kids When Kara Alaimo and her husband traveled with their three-year-old on a quick trip to Florida last month, they left their one-year-old child home with extended family. ""Travel is such a nightmare that we thought she'd be happier not coming along,"" Alaimo wrote. So Alaimo was pleased to hear that United Airlines will now allow families booking basic economy tickets to snag adjacent seats without additional fees for traveling together.          ""United has said it will roll out more family-friendly features this year,"" wrote Kara Alaimo. ""That's good to hear, because we really need them...If airlines want to incentivize more families with young kids to travel, they need to make it a whole lot less difficult."" Fast cars Paul Hockenos, a US native living in Germany, says he's not a slow driver but ""it's utterly disconcerting when, ticking along at a brisk 75 miles per hour, somebody blows by me on the left and then disappears over the horizon as if I were driving a lawnmower."" Germany's 7,200-mile autobahn network is famous for its long stretches without any speed limit, but now there are questions about whether to invest in it further.  Hockenos wrote that the nation's ""transportation sector's carbon emissions, say experts, are attributable overwhelmingly to cars and trucks -- and the higher the speed of a car, the greater the emissions..."" The ""burning question in Germany at the moment is whether tens of billions of euros earmarked for new and broader autobahn wouldn't do more good building out cycling highways, like in the Netherlands, or an improved high-speed, densely networked rail service."" ""Ultimately, the proclivities of the car zealots have no place in the 21st century when we're racing against the clock to decarbonize our economies."" Protecting children online Pressure is building on Congress to protect children online. Patrick T. Brown cited concern about a whistleblower's release of documents indicating that Instagram's data ""showed the site made 'body image issues worse for 1 in 3 teen girls,' and also led to more severe and self-destructive thoughts."" ""While the company disputed the claims, it also postponed an 'Instagram for Kids' offering. Cyberbullying and non-consensual nude photo sharing have plagued high schools.""  The Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA), which has bipartisan support, ""would require social media sites to default minors into the strongest possible privacy protections and give parents new tools to monitor harmful content. It would mandate social media platforms mitigate harms to minors, such as by restricting or eliminating content relating to self-harm, suicide and eating disorders. And it would set up require an annual audit of risks to minors, including providing broader data access to researchers to study the impact of social media on kids' development,"" Brown wrote. Meanwhile, Supreme Court justices admitted their confusion about key aspects of the online world last week. ""I mean, we're a court,"" said Justice Elena Kagan. ""We really don't know about these things. You know, these are not like the nine greatest experts on the internet."" They were trying to make sense of the legal status of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, which shields platforms like Google from liability for the content of their sites. The family of Nohemi Gonzalez, a 23-year-old student from California killed by ISIS terrorists in a Paris bistro in 2015, argues that YouTube, owned by Google, should be held legally responsible for its algorithm allegedly promoting terrorist videos online.  Social media companies, Marc Ginsberg wrote, ""must be held to account for failing to quickly deploy the resources and technology to prevent extremist content from inciting violence despite earning a financial bonanza across their platforms. Section 230 has shielded their need to make that investment."" Grand juror's moment Emily Kohrs, the 30-year-old who was chosen foreperson of the special grand jury investigating claims of voter fraud in Georgia in the 2020 election, rose from obscurity to media stardom within a few days. Kohrs spoke guardedly to major media outlets about the grand jury's findings, including some of the witnesses and evidence. It is rare to hear publicly from someone in that role, particularly before a case is concluded. ""Kohrs won't win any prizes for grand jury foreperson etiquette. Her display has been unseemly, to say the least,"" wrote Norm Eisen and Fred Wertheimer. ""It has violated good taste -- but not the law..."" ""There is no hint in her remarks of special grand jurors being pressured to decide in one way or another,"" they observed. ""The DA may now seek indictments from a regular grand jury that may have read or seen Kohrs' remarks -- but those grand jurors almost certainly have her actual report, so whatever hints Kohrs has dropped are hardly news to them. Any potential targets might argue the statements will influence the trial jurors, but that can be dealt with during jury selection by asking prospective jurors if they heard the statements and were affected by them."" One year later Oleksandra Matviichuk documents the horrors of the Ukraine war in her role as head of the Center for Civil Liberties, a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize last year. ""During those first weeks of the war last year, it was anger that fueled me,"" she wrote. ""Anger that these Russians with their tanks and artillery and planes should decide they had the right to take away our freedom; anger that they should decide we Ukrainians can't have a democratic future.""

Ron DeSantis wanted to send weapons to Ukraine when he was a congressman -- as a presidential hopeful he questions US involvement,2023-02-26,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis once strongly supported arming Ukraine to fight Russia, urging then-President Barack Obama to do so as a deterrent to Russian aggression in Eastern Europe -- a position at odds with his statements this week questioning the United States' involvement in the conflict.   As a conservative congressman, DeSantis, now a potential presidential hopeful, urged sending ""defensive and offensive"" weapons to Ukraine in 2014 and 2015 and even voted to refuse to fund a new missile defense treaty with Russia until they withdrew from Ukraine, according to a review of DeSantis' past comments by CNN's KFile.   Once an advocate of a hardline, hawkish approach to Russia by supporting Ukraine, the Florida governor shifted course this week in anticipation of a potential presidential run in a changed, more isolationist Republican party, questioning whether it was in the United States' interest to be involved in what he called, ""things like the borderlands or over Crimea."" He added that Russia was not ""the same threat to our country, even though they're hostile"" and downplayed the threats that Russia could invade NATO countries.   DeSantis' foreign policy pivot from being a self-described follower of the ""Reagan school"" of foreign policy to a more Trumpian worldview comes as the Republican Party's voting base has grown increasingly isolationist. A recent poll from Pew Research Center shows 40% of Republican and Republican-leaning independent voters now believe the US is providing too much support for Ukraine, up from 9% last year.   A CNN KFile review of DeSantis' past comments and actions found that DeSantis consistently supported sending aid to Ukraine and condemned the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and 2015 and as late as 2017.   In a previously unreported interview with conservative talk radio host Bill Bennett in June 2015, DeSantis said he supported providing arms to Ukraine and NATO neighboring countries after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and criticized the Obama administration for not doing so.  ""We in the Congress have been urging the president, I've been, to provide arms to Ukraine. They want to fight their good fight. They're not asking us to fight it for them. And the president has steadfastly refused. And I think that that's a mistake,"" said DeSantis.   ""I think that when someone like [Russian President Vladimir] Putin sees Obama being indecisive, I think that whets his appetite to create more trouble in the area. And I think if we were to arm the Ukrainians, I think that would send a strong signal to him that he shouldn't be going any further,"" he added.  In an interview from December 2017, DeSantis continued to align himself with the ""Reagan school that's tough on Russia,"" criticizing Democrats for not supporting sending aid to Ukraine.   ""A couple years ago, Obama was refusing to provide lethal aid to Ukraine, they were trying to do a reset. The Democrats lauded that,"" said DeSantis on Fox News. ""They viewed guys like me who are -- who are more of the Reagan school that's tough on Russia as kind of throwbacks to the Cold War. They criticized Mitt Romney in 2012. Now all of a sudden because they're using it against Trump, they're so concerned about Russia.""  DeSantis supported Ukraine after Russia illegally annexed Crimea in 2014  In February and March of 2014, Russia invaded the peninsula Crimea in Ukraine and occupied the territory, illegally annexing it and declaring it as a part of Russia, an act that US and European allies decried and punished.  As a freshman congressman serving on the House Foreign Affairs committee at the time, DeSantis voted for a resolution calling on Russia to withdraw its forces from Ukraine and voted on legislation authorizing $68 million in aid to Ukraine and codifying sanctions on Russia, which later passed in the House and a similar bill was later signed by Obama. He also voted to sanction Russian and Ukrainian officials involved in the annexation as well as provide economic assistance to Ukrainians. In May 2015, DeSantis voted for an amendment in the defense spending bill that would bar funds to implement the START treaty, a nuclear deterrent treaty between the US and Russia, until then-President Obama certified Russian forces were no longer illegally occupying Ukrainian territory. The House approved the amendment, Congress passed the legislation, but Obama vetoed the bill.   DeSantis also co-sponsored a resolution in 2015 supporting free elections without Russian interference in Ukraine, a direct response to the Crimea referendum DeSantis once referred to as a ""obviously a farce.""  While DeSantis strongly rebuked Russian aggression, he did not advocate for military intervention, noting in 2014 that US military options were ""definitely limited.""   ""We have common cause with those folks,"" he said in March 2014, referring to Ukrainians who protested the annexation, ""but it's just a type of situation where militarily, we don't really have any, any options to do much. So, I don't know if Ukraine as a whole is written off, but I don't see us doing very much to reunify Crimea with Ukraine.""  DeSantis argued in an interview with Fox News in May 2015 that Putin ""knows he can get away with things there. And I think if we had a policy which was firm, which armed Ukraine with defensive and offensive weapons so that they could defend themselves, I think Putin would make different calculations.""   He continued, ""And so I think Obama's policy of weakness is actually making a larger conflict more likely. And I think if you had Reagan's policy of strength, I think you'd see people like Putin not wanna mess with us.""  After the Ukraine-Russia war broke out in February 2022  Following Russia's initial invasion in February 2022, DeSantis remained quiet on the issue until he criticized the Biden administration's response and blamed the invasion on President Joe Biden, citing the Afghanistan withdrawal.  ""My feeling is that they haven't done enough, Europe or Biden's administration, to really hit Putin where it counts,"" he said in a February 2022 news conference, emphasizing the Russian economy's reliance on oil and gas exports.  He also expressed support for Ukrainians, saying ""I was heartened to see them having some moxie to fight back.""   ""And let me tell you, if you go into another country with an armed population that is hell bent on resisting you, I mean, it's gonna be death by a thousand cuts for the Russian army,"" DeSantis added.  Days later, DeSantis said in a news conference, ""I think that Putin would probably not have done this if he thought the United States was strong, but I think he thinks that the United States is weak because of the impotence of Biden's administration.""  DeSantis also highlighted his previous support for Ukraine in a different news conference, pointing to weapons for Ukraine funded during the Trump administration.

Media organizations ask Congress for access to January 6 footage,2023-02-25,"CNN, along with a group of other media organizations, has signed on to a letter calling for congressional leaders to grant access to security footage from inside the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, after House Speaker Kevin McCarthy gave Fox News' Tucker Carlson access to the material earlier this month.  In a Friday letter on behalf of the press coalition to McCarthy, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, attorney Charles Tobin called on Congress to release all the security footage showing the attack on the Capitol.  ""Without full public access to the complete historical record, there is concern that an ideologically-based narrative of an already polarizing event will take hold in the public consciousness, with destabilizing risks to the legitimacy of Congress, the Capitol Police, and the various federal investigations and prosecutions of January 6 crimes,"" Tobin said in the letter.  Advance Publications, ABC News, Axios, CBS News, Scripps, Gannett, the Los Angeles Times, Politico and ProPublica are the other media organizations joining CNN on the letter.   The request comes after Carlson announced on his show that he had been granted ""unfettered"" access to ""44,000 hours"" of surveillance footage from inside the Capitol on January 6. CNN previously reported that McCarthy did not consult with his House GOP leadership team or with Jeffries before deciding to give Carlson access.  In an interview with The New York Times on Wednesday, McCarthy justified the decision by saying, ""I promised.""  ""I was asked in the press about these tapes, and I said they do belong to the American public. I think sunshine lets everybody make their own judgment,"" the California Republican told the Times. McCarthy has faced significant pressure from his right flank to relitigate the work of the House select committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, insurrection. The now-defunct January 6 panel got access to all the security footage from US Capitol Police during its investigation, but it did not release some footage for security reasons. A source familiar with the committee's work told CNN that the unreleased footage was considered sensitive material because it showed top officials moving through the US Capitol when they evacuated to safety. During his bid for the speakership, McCarthy vowed to hold hearings on the security failures that led to the Capitol getting overrun, and he told the select committee to preserve all of its records for potential future review by the newly empowered GOP majority.  Carlson has been a prominent promoter of January 6 conspiracy theories and has devoted significant airtime to boosting false claims that liberal ""deep state"" partisans within the FBI orchestrated the insurrection as a way to undermine former President Donald Trump. Some Republican lawmakers had hoped to review the material themselves, likely to look for footage to support their controversial claims about the January 6 attack.  Democrats have criticized McCarthy's decision to give Carlson access to the security footage.  Jeffries said in a letter to colleagues that the move ""represents an egregious security breach that endangers the hardworking women and men of the United States Capitol Police, who valiantly defended our democracy with their lives at risk on that fateful day."" Schumer told his Senate colleagues in a letter that the disclosure ""poses grave security risks to members of Congress and everyone who works on Capitol Hill.""

DeSantis has a new book coming out next week. Here's what his first one said,2023-02-25,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Tuesday will release his book, ""The Courage to be Free,"" to much anticipation ahead of his expected plunge into the 2024 presidential race. But it's not the first time DeSantis has dabbled in authorship to jumpstart his political ambitions. As a little-known Navy prosecutor on the cusp of a bid for a Jacksonville-area congressional seat, DeSantis in 2011 released the audaciously titled ""Dreams from Our Founding Fathers."" He has joked that the book -- from an obscure publisher that mostly dealt in children's titles and a thriller series produced by a middle school principal -- received little acclaim and was ""read by about a dozen people.""  Unlike most entries in the political genre, it's not a memoir and its autobiographical content is sparse. Rather, it's a lengthy critique of Barack Obama's political ascent and presidency, affixed on the hypothesis that the policies and philosophies of the country's first Black executive diverged dramatically from the ""enduring truths that the Constitution's creators relied upon when they framed America's foundational document."" It litigates the case by contrasting the then-president's beliefs and background (pulling often from the Democrat's own best-selling 1995 autobiography, ""Dreams from My Father"") with the writings of the Founding Fathers.  It's an instructive window into DeSantis' governing beliefs, which at times seem to collide with his current leadership style but may soon inform his platform as he seeks higher office. It shows the early seeds of his disdain for the media, strongly suggests Christianity is foundational to the Constitution and demonstrates his early willingness to buck establishment forces in his own party. As was the time, the book also serves as a full-throated defense of the tea party movement while eviscerating the Affordable Care Act, the healthcare law signed by Obama that provoked Republicans across the country -- including DeSantis -- to run for office. But it also makes historical arguments for the preservation of slavery and touches on Obama's roots and Muslim outreach in ways that Democrats have already amplified ahead of DeSantis' expected run for president.  Here are four takeaways from the book. Using the Founding Fathers and the Federalist Papers as a guide DeSantis' views on the country's founding document and the reach of the federal government is informed heavily by the Federalist Papers, the essays produced by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison and John Jay to persuade New York to ratify the US Constitution. DeSantis writes that these essays represent ""the single best source for the exposition of the principles underlying the Constitution of the United States of America."" It's these writings that often buttress DeSantis' criticisms of Obama and his insistence that the Democrat's vision of America is antithetical to its foundational document. To DeSantis, the very notion of a ""transformative"" presidency flies in the face of the static role of the executive envisioned by the Framers. (The word ""transform"" appears 75 times throughout the short work.)  In his book, DeSantis argued that the Constitution's creators expected representatives to be responsive -- though not beholden -- to public opinion, especially when pursuing far-reaching pieces of legislation. As it is, DeSantis said, Obama and his allies should have looked at the decades of opposition to health care reform as a sign not to mess with it.  DeSantis as governor, though, has often eschewed public opinion when taking actions and has proudly declared, ""I'm not going to lead based on polls."" For example, DeSantis signed the most restrictive abortion law in Florida's modern history despite consistent support for making the procedure accessible to women.  It's not the only inconsistent view on leadership between DeSantis the author and DeSantis the politician.  DeSantis also took great umbrage at descriptions of Obama ""casting his candidacy as one of singular historical significance and himself as a messianic figure."" But his own closing message to Florida voters last fall came in a 90-second video that suggested he was made by God on the eighth day to be a ""fighter."" He also compared Obama with George Washington, who, DeSantis wrote, possessed ""a deep sense of humility, a humility that dovetailed superbly with the ethos of republican government."" And he noted that the Founding Fathers warned of a demagogue leader who ""capitalizes on popular prejudices by peddling false claims, by employing questionable rhetorical techniques, or by intentionally sowing divisions among different factions or interests within the body politic."" DeSantis as a Republican primary candidate for governor in 2018 campaigned almost exclusively on his endorsement from then-President Donald Trump, who often peddled false claims and once claimed, ""I alone can fix it."" Slavery as a necessary compromise DeSantis at one point accused Obama of not paying fealty to the Constitution with the same vigor as his predecessors and suggested it was because of Obama's inability to look beyond the codification of slavery at the nation's birth. DeSantis wrote that after the 2010 midterms, ""a noticeably agitated Obama even declared, 'I couldn't go through the front door at this country's founding' "" -- an opinion DeSantis called ""seriously flawed."" DeSantis throughout the book is dismissive of criticism that the Founding Fathers are tainted by their failure to end the enslavement of Black Americans, and he described the preservation of slavery and the three-fifths compromise as necessary to ensure the passage of the Constitution -- ""a view shared by strongly anti-slavery delegates like Alexander Hamilton and Benjamin Franklin,"" he wrote. ""Slavery had been a fact of life throughout human history, and had existed in Britain's American colonies for 150 years before the Convention at Philadelphia in 1787. In certain southern states, slave labor was the backbone of the entire economy, and immediately abolishing slavery would have represented an enlightened but also a monumental change -- a revolution far more socially, politically and economically momentous than the American Revolution itself,"" DeSantis wrote. ""This is why there was no real chance that the Convention would abolish the peculiar institution of slavery."" More recently, DeSantis has contended that the American revolution itself ""caused people to question slavery"" and birthed abolition movements. ""No one had questioned it before we decided as Americans that we are endowed by our creator with inalienable rights,"" DeSantis said last year.  DeSantis went on to argue in his book that Obama's views were more closely aligned with the slavery defender Sen. Stephen A. Douglas, who lost the 1860 presidential election to Abraham Lincoln, than the great emancipator.  ""Though Obama made every attempt to draw comparisons between himself and Lincoln, it is actually one of Lincoln's foremost political adversaries and one of Obama's predecessors, Stephen A. Douglas, who argued like Obama that the Founders meant to exclude non-whites from the natural rights clarion call contained in the Declaration of Independence."" DeSantis would use this rhetorical trick again in the book to accuse Obama of ascribing to ""the same doctrine that Chief Justice Taney invoked in Dred Scott"" -- the Supreme Court case that found enslaved African Americans could not claim citizenship and didn't enjoy the rights ascribed by the Constitution.  This criticism of slavery's perversions clouding constitutional judgment extended to Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, the country's first Black justice, DeSantis contended. DeSantis took issue with Marshall's criticism of the Framers on the grounds that ""the government they devised was defective from the start."" DeSantis wrote: ""Such criticism misses the mark."" A time capsule to the Affordable Care Act debate At the time DeSantis published his book, few topics animated voters like the 2010 passage of Obama's signature domestic achievement, the Affordable Care Act. DeSantis accused the law's champions of putting ""America on a course to a government-run, single-payer system"" -- a warning that has yet to materialize, though several Democratic candidates for president ran on such a policy during the 2020 election. DeSantis' opposition to ""ObamaCare"" isn't surprising on its face. As a lawmaker, he voted often with his Republican colleagues to repeal the Affordable Care Act and he was a founding member of the Freedom Caucus, which helped orchestrate a federal government shutdown aimed at defunding the law. But unlike some Republicans, who at times voiced support for the law's more popular provisions (like the requirement for insurance to cover children until age 26), DeSantis' opposition appeared wholesale. ""Initially justified by Obama as a needed remedy for the problem of rising health care costs that hurt members of the middle class, the post-passage euphoria revealed a different, more controversial justification for a federal overhaul of the health care system: the redistribution of wealth,"" DeSantis wrote. Even the requirement for insurance companies to cover adults and children with pre-existing conditions appeared problematic to DeSantis because it could lead to higher insurance costs.  ""Though this sounded noble, the law had the effect of undermining insurance coverage for children,"" DeSantis contended. ""By mandating that insurers take on more risk than is economically justifiable, ObamaCare forced insurers either to absorb financial losses or else increase premiums for all policies."" Can DeSantis match his goal posts? DeSantis in his book laid out a blueprint for leadership that is rigidly confined to a strict reading of the Constitution and adherence to ""fundamental law with stable meaning."" This includes limitations on the executive branch's abilities and a rigorous adherence to separation of powers.  As governor, DeSantis has at times flouted seemingly similar constraints on executive power that he often charged Obama with crossing in his book. For example, he accused Obama's then-health and human services secretary, Kathleen Sebelius, of using ""her power to intimidate private businesses for engaging in speech she didn't like. This illustrates the progressive impulse to centralize authority in bureaucratic arrangements at its apogee."" But as governor, DeSantis issued an eerily similar warning to businesses not to get in his way, or else. ""If you are in one of these corporations, if you're a woke CEO, you want to get involved in our legislative business, look, it's a free country,"" DeSantis said in 2021. ""But understand, if you do that, I'm fighting back against you. And I'm going to make sure that people understand your business practices, and anything I don't like about what you're doing."" It's a lesson Disney certainly learned.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",61,51.0,0.058,0.875,0.067,0.0772,0.11,0.77,0.12,0.952,4.7092,-18.931179999999994,225.0,-0.08413857777777775
"Rep. Scott Perry was 'persistent' in contacting executive branch around 2020 election, court documents reveal",2023-02-25,"The seized cell phone of Rep. Scott Perry contained 930 records where the Pennsylvania Republican often tried to cajole executive branch officials around the 2020 presidential election, according to newly released court papers in the fight over his cell phone data.  ""Rep. Perry's communications with Executive Branch officials, as reflected in the responsive records, demonstrate that he welcomed, rather than resisted, and indeed often initiated these communication [redacted],"" Chief Judge Beryl Howell of the DC District Court wrote in one of four unsealed opinions, after she had reviewed the records and decided to release them to prosecutors.  Around the 2020 election, the Pennsylvania lawmaker had been in touch with President Donald Trump and powerful Trump backers, including White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark and others who pushed false claims of election fraud.  His communications with the executive branch, she wrote, were ""proactive, persistent and protracted.""  The newly available court records provide more insight into the scope of the ongoing fight over Perry's phone, which is part of special counsel Jack Smith's criminal investigation around January 6, 2021. In total, Howell on Friday unsealed four opinions with redactions that she wrote related to the Justice Department's ability to access more than 2,200 records on the congressman's cell phone, after the FBI seized the device last year.   Howell also called Perry's phone compendium a ""multi-pronged push for Executive Branch officials to take more aggressive action,"" likely in response to suspicions of election fraud, and deemed those cell phone records not covered by congressional protection. In another part of her rulings, Howell wrote how Perry's communications with private individuals shouldn't stay secret from investigators, either -- including almost 700 records showing his interest in election security and electors as well as contact with Trump campaign attorneys. ""What is plain is that the Clause does not shield Rep. Perry's random musings with private individuals touting an expertise in cybersecurity or political discussions with attorneys from a presidential campaign, or with state legislators concerning hearings before them about possible local election fraud or actions they could take to challenge election results in Pennsylvania,"" Howell wrote. Unsealings Friday While Howell ultimately let Perry keep about 161 of his records from investigators under the Constitution's Speech or Debate Clause -- a provision that shields legislators from certain law enforcement actions targeting conduct related to their legislative duties -- she ordered that the 2,000 other records be given to Justice Department investigators. The inquiry is now part of special counsel Smith's January 6 investigation.  Perry has appealed her ruling, managing to keep secret all 2,000 records for almost seven months since his phone's seizure, and the DC Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments in the case on Thursday.  Because some of those arguments were public, Howell released redacted versions of her opinions and orders in the case Friday night. She largely rejected Perry's arguments for privacy, calling his approach to the case an ""astonishing view of the scope of the legislative privilege"" that would ""truly cloak Members of Congress with a powerful dual non-disclosure and immunity shield for virtually any of their activities that could be deemed information gathering about any matter which might engage legislative attention."" 44 days The unsealed court orders also provided  more insight into the search itself, and how the case came to be.  After Perry's phone was seized and copied by FBI agents on August 9, the Justice Department returned to court for a warrant to review the contents of his phone. Nine days later, Howell approved the warrant, ""finding probable cause that a crime was committed"" and that evidence of the crime would be found on Perry's phone, according to the unsealed opinions. Perry had 44 days to argue to the court his Speech or Debate privileges as a member of Congress, which could protect records of legitimate legislative activity from the federal investigation. He told the court his phone contained ""communications with his staff, members of Congress, and others"" -- then logged records on his phone, including ""Notes,"" by date, recipient, sender and subject matter for a judge to consider.  Howell then went through those records.  Perry has not been charged with a crime. Accusations of slow-walking Howell last November showed concern that Perry's team was trying to ""unilaterally delay"" the criminal investigation. The court fight itself has put on hold DOJ's ability to access the content of Perry's phone. And, Howell accused Perry's team of slow-walking the work on the case, as their review of the contents of the phone last fall went slowly as the litigation moved forward.  His team was reviewing his phone records for possible privilege assertions at a rate of 265 documents a day, the Justice Department told the judge, while the court had ordered them to review records at a rate of 800 a day, according to one of the opinions released Friday. ""If Rep. Perry has indeed significantly deviated from the pace required under the Perry Privilege Log Order, and he continues to slow-walk producing privilege logs to the government ... he risks forfeiting his right to assert his privilege,"" she wrote in November. ""Rep. Perry is now on notice to speed up his review."" The timing of his documents review didn't arise again in Howell's future opinions, according to the redacted now-released court records. This story has been updated with additional details.

A first report on the Ohio toxic train wreck was released. Here's what it found — and what investigators are still looking into,2023-02-24,"After federal officials released an initial report concluding that this month's toxic train wreck in Ohio was completely preventable, investigators will begin examining procedures, practices and design prior to the derailment that has sparked long-term concerns among hundreds of frustrated residents. The National Transportation Safety Board on Thursday released its preliminary report on the investigation into the February 3 train crash in East Palestine, Ohio, where residents have been complaining about feeling sick after hazardous chemicals seeped into the air, water and soil.  Ohio environmental officials made a civil referral this week asking the state attorney general's office to begin ""legal and/or equitable civil actions"" against train operator Norfolk Southern, which could result in a civil complaint if negotiations with the company were to fail. The NTSB report found that one of the train's cars carrying plastic pellets was heated by a hot axle that sparked the initial fire, according to Jennifer Homendy, the chair of the safety board. As the temperature of the bearing got hotter, the train passed by two wayside defect detectors that did not trigger an audible alarm message because the heat threshold was not met at that point, Homendy explained. A third detector eventually picked up the high temperature, but it was already too late by then.  ""This was 100% preventable. ... There is no accident. Every single event that we investigate is preventable,"" Homendy said during a news conference Thursday. ""The NTSB has one goal, and that is safety and ensuring that this never happens again."" The next phase of the investigation will examine the train's wheelset and bearing as well as the damage from the derailment, the NTSB report noted. The agency will also focus on the designs of tank cars and railcars along with maintenance procedures and practices.  Plus, investigators will review the train operator's use of wayside defect detectors and the company's railcar inspection practices. More specifically, determining what caused the wheel bearing failure will be key to the investigation, Homendy said. 'This is not a time for politics,' NTSB chair says On Friday, Homendy said on ""CNN This Morning"" that she's concerned politics could cloud the investigation and prevent safety improvements. Former President Donald Trump visited the site of the train derailment on Wednesday where he criticized President Joe Biden's administration's handling of the railway disaster. ""This is not a time for politics,"" Homendy said. ""There is a time for politics. It is not this.""  On Thursday, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg also visited the derailment site, and when asked how political figures like Trump could help, Buttigieg addressed the former president directly saying he could ""express support for reversing the deregulation that happened on his watch.""   Another key aspect of the investigation will focus on the response to the chemical disaster, particularly the manual detonations of tanks carrying toxic chemicals.  Five of the 38 derailed train cars were carrying more than 115,000 gallons of vinyl chloride, according to the NTSB's report. Exposure to high levels of vinyl chloride can increase cancer risk or cause death. Those five cars ""continued to concern authorities because the temperature inside one tank car was still rising,"" indicating a polymerization reaction which could have resulted in an explosion, the report said. To help prevent a potentially deadly blast of vinyl chloride, crews released the toxic chemical into a trench and burned it off on February  6 — three days after the derailment. Since then, some East Palestine residents  have said they are experiencing headaches, dizziness, nausea and bloody noses — a host of health issues they say they did not have prior to the crash. At the same time, officials have been adamant in reassuring residents of the air's safety and the municipal water supply.  2 million gallons of firefighting water to be disposed of in Texas Around 2 million gallons of firefighting water from the train derailment site are expected to be disposed in Harris County, Texas, according to the county's chief executive.  Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo said her office was told by Texas Molecular on Thursday that the shipments began arriving around last Wednesday, she said.  Texas Molecular was hired to dispose of the potentially dangerous water from the train derailment, the company, which said it has more than four decades of experience in managing water safely, has told CNN. The company told Hidalgo's office Thursday that half a million gallons were already in the county.  Hidalgo expressed frustration that she first learned about the water shipments from the news media -- not from a government agency or Texas Molecular. ""It's a very real problem we were told yesterday the materials were coming only to learn today they've been here for a week,"" Hidalgo said. She added that although there's no legal requirement for her office to be notified, ""It doesn't quite seem right.""  Texas Molecular is receiving the water from trucks, but it's unclear if trucks are used for the entire trip, Hidalgo said. The company told her office they're receiving about 30 trucks of water a day, she said. CNN is seeking comment from Texas Molecular about how the water is being transported. Hidalgo said her office is looking for information about the disposal, including the chemical composition of the firefighting water, the precautions that are being taken, and why Harris County was the chosen site. ""There's nothing right now to tell me -- to tell us -- there's going to be an accident in transport, that this is being done in such a way that is not compatible with the well, that there's a nefarious reason why the water is coming here and not to a closer site,"" Hidalgo said. ""But it is our job to do basic due diligence on that information.""  A total of 1.7 million gallons of contaminated liquid have been removed from the immediate site of the derailment, according to a Thursday news release from the Ohio Emergency Management Agency.  More than 1.1 million gallons of ""contaminated liquid"" from East Palestine have been transported off-site so far, with the majority going to Texas Molecular and the rest going to a facility in Vickery, Ohio.  CNN has asked the Ohio agency the location of the remaining 581,500 gallons, which have been ""removed"" but not ""hauled off-site.""  Michigan congresswoman says she was unaware contaminated soil was coming to her state Congresswoman Debbie Dingell of Michigan said she was ""not given a heads up"" that contaminated soil from East Palestine would be transported to the US Ecology Wayne Disposal in Belleville, Michigan. ""We were not given a heads up on this reported action,"" Dingell said in a press release on Friday, ""Our priority is to always keep the people we represent safe."" Dingell said inquires to the EPA, Department of Transportation, Norfolk Southern, US Ecology, the state of Ohio and others involved are in the process. On Friday afternoon, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine released an update on the removal of the contaminated site in East Palestine, saying that soil would be transported to Michigan. So far, 4,832 cubic yards of soil have been removed from the ground in East Palestine. Approximately six truckloads of that contaminated soil are on their way to the hazardous waste disposal facility in Michigan, according to a news release from DeWine.  Evidence does not show wrongdoing from crew  The 149-car train operated by Norfolk Southern on February 3 had three employees on board: a locomotive engineer, a conductor and a trainee who were all in the head end of the locomotive, Homendy told CNN's Jake Tapper on Thursday.  So far, the investigation found the crew did not do anything wrong prior to the derailment, though the crash was ""100% preventable,"" Homendy said.  Video of the train before the derailment showed what appeared to be an overheated wheel bearing, according to the NTSB report. Footage showed sparks flying from underneath the train.  NTSB investigators are now focusing on one train car's wheel set and bearing to figure out what may have caused the overheating, Homendy said.  ""We have a lot of questions about that,"" she said Friday, including the ""thresholds and why they vary so much between railroads.""    Ultimately, it's the railroads that set the temperature thresholds for the detectors, Homendy said.    Releasing publicly a probable cause or causes for the derailment could take 12 to 18 months, Homendy said during the news conference.  ""We are very deliberative. We are the gold standard when it comes to investigations globally, and we are methodical in our approach,"" Homendy said. ""But if we see a safety issue that we need to be addressed immediately, something systemic, we will not hesitate to issue an urgent safety recommendation.""  In the meantime, here's what the NTSB preliminary report found so far:  One wheel bearing's temperature reached a ""critical"" level — 253 degrees Fahrenheit above the ambient temperature — and prompted an audible alarm that instructed ""the crew to slow and stop the train to inspect a hot axle,"" the report says.
The train's engineer applied the train's brakes and additional braking after the alert of an overheating axle, the report states. ""During this deceleration, the wheel bearing failed,"" Homendy explained. ""Car 23 derailed, and the train initiated an emergency brake application and came to a stop."" Even after reading the preliminary NTSB report, Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost told ""CNN This Morning"" that there's still a lot of facts he doesn't know. Among his biggest questions are: ""Had the train been shorter, had there been additional staff, could this have been averted? Based on the alerts that occurred, how long is the reaction time and how is that influenced by the size of the train?"" Yost told CNN. How officials have responded The US Environmental Protection Agency has ordered Norfolk Southern to cover the full cost of cleaning up the aftermath of the train crash. ""EPA has special authority for situations just like this where we can compel companies who inflict trauma and cause environmental and health damage to communities, like Norfolk Southern has done, to completely clean up the mess that they've caused and pay for it,"" EPA administrator Michael Regan said. Norfolk Southern will be required to: Provide a descriptive work plan on how they intend to clean up the water, soil and debris
Reimburse the EPA for providing residents a cleaning service of their homes and businesses
Show up to public meetings and explain their progress If the company does not follow the order, the EPA will step in to complete the duties, while fining Norfolk Southern up to $70,000 a day, Regan said Wednesday during a CNN town hall.

"Biden: 'At this point I'm not' planning to visit East Palestine, Ohio, after toxic train derailment",2023-02-25,"President Joe Biden told reporters at the White House Friday he has no plans travel to East Palestine, Ohio, and defended his administration's response to the train derailment there that caused a toxic chemical spill. ""At this point, I'm not,"" Biden said, when asked if he has any plans to visit the community, pointing instead to his and his administration's early and consistent response to the disaster. ""You know, we were there two hours after the train went down -- two hours,"" Biden said. ""I've spoken with every single major figure in both Pennsylvania and in Ohio, and so the idea that we're not engaged is just simply not there. And initially, there was not a request for me to go out even before I was heading over to Kyiv, so I'm keeping very close tabs on it. We're doing all we can."" Biden, who was briefed Friday on the latest developments, noted that he had held a ""long meeting with my team"" on Zoom. Following Biden's comments, a White House official shared a detailed timeline outlining the federal government's response in the wake of the derailment, including the arrival of federal teams from the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Transportation, the Federal Railroad Administration, and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration just two hours after Norfolk Southern reported the derailment to the National Response Center at 10:53 p.m. ET on February 3. According to the timeline, the White House contacted Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine to offer additional federal assistance on February 5, with Biden calling DeWine and Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro on February 6. ""Federal teams have continued to arrive in East Palestine -- investigating the cause of the derailment, making Norfolk Southern clean up its mess and reimburse families, conducting public health screenings, monitoring the air and water, and screening over 550 homes,"" the official told CNN. But the Biden administration's response has drawn criticism from Republicans, including East Palestine Mayor Trent Conaway, who told Fox News earlier this week that Biden's decision to visit Ukraine while the situation was unfolding in Ohio was ""the biggest slap in the face, that tells you right now he doesn't care about us."" In remarks from East Palestine Wednesday, former President Donald Trump slammed the Biden administration's handling of the situation, telling supporters in Ohio, ""You are not forgotten."" Per the White House, Biden made calls Tuesday from Warsaw, Poland, to receive updates on the EPA's response, including with PA Administrator Michael Regan, Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, Ohio Republican Rep. Bill Johnson, DeWine and Shapiro. Pressed on the administration's response, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Thursday, ""Yes, he [Biden] is satisfied"" at his administration's response, while touting agency work throughout the crisis. ""Showing up is having the Environmental Protection administrator on the ground, showing up is having the DOT secretary on the ground to talk about what is the next process, holding to account the account the company that caused the spill,"" she said, while criticizing ""bad faith attacks"" against members of Biden's administration, including Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",16,54.0,0.0,0.896,0.104,0.4404,0.065,0.901,0.034,-0.9511,7.0464,34.32855000000001,195.0,0.1760438461538462
"12 blue states sue FDA, saying it's too strict in limiting abortion drugs as legal battle over mifepristone heats up",2023-02-25,"Twelve states led by liberal attorneys general announced Friday that they had sued the Food and Drug Administration, saying its limits on mifepristone, one of the two drugs used for medication abortion, are too strict.  The suit is a possible hedge by states waiting to see how a federal judge in Texas rules in a lawsuit brought by anti-abortion groups seeking to block the FDA's approval of mifepristone altogether. Conflicting rulings could mean the Supreme Court is asked to sort out the issue. RELATED: How a medication abortion, also known as an 'abortion pill,' works ""The federal government has known for years that mifepristone is safe and effective,"" Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson said in a statement. ""In the wake of the Supreme Court's radical decision overturning Roe v. Wade, the FDA is now exposing doctors, pharmacists and patients to unnecessary risk. The FDA's excessive restrictions on this important drug have no basis in medical science."" Mifepristone was first approved in 2000 and medication abortion accounts for more than half of the abortions in the US. It is the first drug, followed by misoprostol, in the medication abortion regimen. Patients and providers must sign agreements stating the drug will be used to end a pregnancy, and pharmacies must have special certification.  The lawsuit was filed in federal court in the Eastern District of Washington state. The states in the lawsuit are: Washington, Oregon, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Rhode Island and Vermont. Final brief filed in Texas lawsuit A lawsuit seeking to block the use of medication abortion nationwide could receive an initial decision at any moment, after the plaintiffs in the case submitted to the court on Friday their final brief on the challenge.   The lawsuit, filed in November by anti-abortion advocates against FDA, challenges the two-decade-old approval of mifepristone, the first drug in the medication abortion process.   A decision by US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, in favor of the plaintiffs could have far-reaching consequences since medication abortion now makes up a majority of abortions obtained in the US.   In the filing submitted Friday, the anti-abortion advocates rehashed many of the arguments they made in earlier briefs. Its submission means that Kacsmaryk could soon rule on a motion by the plaintiffs to temporarily block use of the medication. The judge had previously said that once the February 24 filing deadline ended, ""briefing will then be closed on the matter, absent any 'exceptional or extraordinary circumstances.'""  Kacsmaryk, however, could also call for a hearing, or ask for additional responses.   The defendants in the case -- the FDA and Danco, which makes mifepristone -- argued in separate briefs to the court that a decision against the drug's approval would be unprecedented and would shutter the drugmaker's business.   Reproductive rights advocates have stressed that a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs would be devastating, with NARAL Pro-Choice America saying in a statement that if the drug is yanked from the market, ""64.5 million women of reproductive age in the US would lose access to medication abortion care, an exponential increase in harm overnight.""

Fulton County judge who oversaw special grand jury in Trump probe says jurors are free to discuss final report,2023-02-24,"The judge who oversaw a special grand jury investigating efforts by former President Donald Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia says he instructed jurors they were prevented from discussing deliberations but did not face restrictions in talking about the panel's final report. ""The contents of the report are not deliberations,"" Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney told CNN. McBurney also said that the special grand jury, which has faced criticism from Trump and his legal team, did its job consistent with the rules governing special grand juries in the state. ""They complied with their charter,"" he said. The judge has ordered the contents of the panel's final report, including recommendations about whether anyone should face indictments, to remain under seal. But he acknowledged that special grand jurors are not prevented from discussing their work product. ""What witnesses said, what you put in your report, those are not off-limits,"" he added. The report includes recommendations from the special grand jury about whether Trump or any of his associates should face criminal charges. The panel's foreperson, Emily Kohrs, went on a media blitz this week, suggesting in interviews with CNN and other outlets that the special grand jury recommended more than a dozen indictments. McBurney declined to comment on whether he believed Kohrs crossed a line about what special grand jurors were allowed to divulge during her media appearances. ""It's not for me to assess,"" the judge said.                                                                 McBurney, who previously spoke with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution about the instructions governing special grand jurors, elaborated on what constitutes deliberations. He noted that if a witness or prosecutor was present with the special grand jury, those discussions would be fair game for special grand jurors to discuss publicly. ""If someone is presenting or if a witness is testifying responding to questions from a prosecutor, or the district attorney is talking to the grand jury, that is not deliberations,"" McBurney said. While the special grand jury cannot issue indictments -- and ultimately it will be up to Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis to determine if anyone should face charges -- Kohrs' media tour set off some backlash about the process, particularly from Trump's attorneys. ""What we have seen over the past 48-hours proves that whatever conclusions were drawn were not the result of an analytical, trustworthy, or credible investigation as one would expect in a matter of historic proportion such as this,"" Trump attorneys Drew Findling, Jennifer Little and Marissa Goldberg said in a statement this week.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.64, 'pos': 0.36, 'compound': 0.8402}",16,56.0,0.061399999999999996,0.775,0.1636,0.4923,0.028,0.762,0.21,0.9981,7.8768,39.04355,153.0,0.25518660130718956
"'It's a major blow': Dominion has uncovered 'smoking gun' evidence in case against Fox News, legal experts say",2023-02-24,"Fox News is in serious hot water.  That's what several legal experts told CNN this week following Dominion Voting Systems explosive legal filing against the right-wing talk channel, revealing the network's executives and hosts privately blasted the election fraud claims being peddled by Donald Trump's team, despite allowing lies about the 2020 contest to be promoted on its air. While the legal experts cautioned that they would like to see Fox News' formal legal response to the filing, they all indicated in no uncertain terms that the evidence compiled in Dominion's legal filing represents a serious threat to the channel. ""It's a major blow,"" attorney Floyd Abrams of Pentagon Papers fame said, adding that the ""recent revelations certainly put Fox in a more precarious situation"" in defending against the lawsuit on First Amendment grounds. A version of this article first appeared in the ""Reliable Sources"" newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. Rebecca Tushnet, the Frank Stanton Professor of First Amendment Law at Harvard Law School, described Dominion's evidence as a ""very strong"" filing that ""clearly lays out the difference between what Fox was saying publicly and what top people at Fox were privately admitting."" A cache of behind-the-scenes messages included in the legal filing showed Fox Corp chairman Rupert Murdoch called Trump's claims ""really crazy stuff,"" and the cable network's stars — including Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, and Laura Ingraham — brutally mock the lies being pushed by the former president's camp asserting that the election was rigged. It also showed attempts to crack down on fact-checking election lies. On one occasion, Carlson demanded that Fox News White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich be fired after she fact-checked a Trump tweet pushing election fraud claims. Tushnet said that in all of her years practicing and teaching law, she had never seen such damning evidence collected in the pre-trial phase of a defamation suit. ""I don't recall anything comparable to this,"" Tushnet said. ""Donald Trump seems to be very good at generating unprecedented situations."" David Korzenik, an attorney who teaches First Amendment law and represents a number of media organizations, said that the filing showed Dominion's case against Fox News has serious teeth. Korzenik stressed that while the law allows for bias and ratings-seeking behavior by media outlets, it does not allow for the publication of material one knows to be false. The filing, Korzenik said, ""certainly puts Fox in the actual malice crosshairs and puts them in real jeopardy."" RonNell Andersen Jones, a professor and media law scholar at the University of Utah, described the evidence as ""pretty voluminous"" and said that she too had never seen evidence like it collected in a high-profile defamation case against an outlet as enormous as Fox. ""This is a pretty staggering brief,"" Jones said. ""Dominion's filing here is unique not just as to the volume of the evidence but also as to the directness of the evidence and the timeline of the evidence."" ""This 'out of the horse's mouth' evidence of knowing falsity is not something we often see,"" Jones added. ""When coupled with the compelling storyline that Dominion is telling about motivation — the evidence that at least some key players in the organization were actively looking to advance some election denialism in order to win back viewers who had departed — it makes for a strong actual malice storyline."" In a statement, Fox News accused Dominion of generating ""noise and confusion,"" adding, ""the core of this case remains about freedom of the press and freedom of speech, which are fundamental rights afforded by the Constitution and protected by New York Times v. Sullivan."" ""Dominion has mischaracterized the record, cherry-picked quotes stripped of key context, and spilled considerable ink on facts that are irrelevant under black-letter principles of defamation law,"" the network said. ""Their motion for summary judgment takes an extreme and unsupported view of defamation law and rests on an accounting of the facts that has no basis in the record."" But the attorneys said Dominion's filing showed it had built a powerful case against Fox. ""The dream for a plaintiff's attorney is what Dominion claims to have here,"" Jones said, ""smoking-gun internal statements both acknowledging the lie and deciding to forge ahead with perpetuating it.""","{'neg': 0.127, 'neu': 0.794, 'pos': 0.079, 'compound': -0.2263}",27,57.0,0.153,0.74575,0.101,-0.23925,0.053,0.844,0.103,0.9888,-6.45975,17.213200000000008,152.0,0.11324473684210531
Media outlets ask Georgia Supreme Court to release full grand jury report on Trump 2020 election probe,2023-02-24,"A coalition of media outlets is asking the Georgia Supreme Court to reconsider a decision that blocked the full release of a Fulton County special grand jury report, which includes recommendations for whether former President Donald Trump or any of his associates should face criminal charges for their efforts to undermine the 2020 election. A lower court order blocking most of the report's release ""prevented the public and press from reading the full Report even though it addresses a subject of paramount public concern to this state and nation: possible wrongdoing in connection with the US Presidential election of 2020, including possible wrongdoing by the then sitting US President,"" the media coalition, which includes CNN, argued Friday in a court filing. The Georgia Supreme Court can decide whether or not to take up the appeal, which comes after Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney released snippets of the report earlier this month.  But McBurney, who oversaw the special grand jury, decided to keep the vast majority of the document under seal, including recommendations for who should face criminal charges. McBurney wrote in his decision that it was a matter of ""fundamental fairness"" to keep the special grand jury's conclusions under wraps to protect the rights of potential defendants and others named in the report. ""Here, however, for anyone named in the special purpose grand jury's final report who was not afforded the opportunity to appear before the grand jury, none of those due process rights has been satisfied,"" McBurney wrote in his February order. ""And for those who did appear -- willingly or not -- only the right to be heard (although without counsel or rebuttal) was protected."" The media coalition argued Friday that the special grand jury's report constitutes a court document primed for public release and claimed the reputational concerns of those named in the report do not outweigh the public's interest in viewing its findings. ""The Report should be a public court record so that the citizens of the nation and this County can determine for themselves whether the future prosecutorial decisions of the District Attorney's Office 'do justice' under Georgia's laws,"" the media coalition wrote. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, an elected Democrat, has previously argued against the report's public release, citing her ongoing investigation. Ultimately, the special grand jury can't issue indictments on its own. It will be up to Willis to determine who to pursue charges against. Since McBurney's decision to keep most of the report secret, more information about the panel's findings has publicly emerged. Emily Kohrs, the foreperson for the special grand jury granted a handful of media interviews, including with CNN, in which she suggested the panel had recommended more than a dozen people for indictment. She declined to say whether Trump was on that list of recommendations, but told CNN, ""There may be some names on that list that you wouldn't expect. But the big name that everyone keeps asking me about -- I don't think you will be shocked."" Trump's lawyers have slammed the foreperson's media tour, saying in a statement that the media blitz ""proves that whatever conclusions were drawn"" by the grand jury ""were not the result of an analytical, trustworthy, or credible investigation, as one would expect in a matter of historic proportion such as this.""","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.694, 'pos': 0.306, 'compound': 0.765}",17,58.0,0.051666666666666666,0.8503333333333334,0.09766666666666667,0.44985,0.051,0.805,0.144,0.9959,7.64745,24.14890000000001,96.0,0.25155104166666675
Exclusive: How a box with classified documents ended up in Trump's office months after FBI searched Mar-a-Lago,2023-02-24,"The Justice Department wants to know how a box containing a handful of classified records scattered among copies of presidential schedules turned up at Mar-a-Lago late last year, well after several rounds of searches of the property by federal agents and aides to former President Donald Trump, according to people familiar with the matter.    Investigators working for special counsel Jack Smith in recent weeks have interviewed a Trump aide who copied classified materials found in the box using her phone to put them onto a laptop. After a voluntary interview with the aide, prosecutors subpoenaed the password to the laptop, which she provided, according to one of the sources. The classified documents contained in the box were discovered in December, after the Justice Department told Trump's legal team to conduct yet another search for documents at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort.  People familiar with the Trump legal team's efforts to locate documents describe a confusing chain of events that delayed discovery of the box, including having its contents uploaded to the cloud, emailed to a Trump employee, and moved to an offsite location before finally ending up back at a Mar-a-Lago bridal suite that is now Trump's office -- the very place that the FBI had searched just weeks earlier.   Trump's legal team has acknowledged in recent weeks they turned over to the special counsel the box and a laptop containing its scanned contents. But prosecutors have continued asking why it wasn't given to the Justice Department earlier, and what if any role or knowledge Trump may have had about its movements, sources said. The odyssey of the box has been a recent focus of Smith's investigation into the mishandling of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago, according to people familiar with the line of questioning from federal prosecutors. The haphazard handling of documents that ended up online, on computers and moved around to multiple locations could further complicate Trump's case in an investigation with criminal implications.  One person who described the box's movements and the special counsel's inquiry into it described federal investigators as suspecting a ""shell game with classified documents."" The person said Trump's daily movements and instructions to staff are a core part of prosecutors' questions as well.  Tim Parlatore, an attorney for Trump, said in an interview with CNN earlier this month that the aide had not seen the classified markings.  ""After we did the search in December and found within this box of thousands that there were a couple of pages that had a little marking at the bottom, which we turned over, after that, we found out that she had scanned the box so that it would be digitized,"" Parlatore said. ""She had no idea that there was any classification markings on anything. And as soon as we found out about that, we called up the DOJ to let them know and immediately provided them access to it.""  A spokesman for the special counsel's office declined to comment.  From tennis cottage to bridal suite In the fall of 2021, a longtime Trump staffer at the White House and Mar-a-Lago initially sent the box to a lower-level Trump aide, who has been employed by the former president since he left office. The staffer wanted copies of presidential schedules in the box to be scanned.    The aide took the box to Mar-a-Lago's ""tennis cottage,"" where she worked. No scanning machine was available there for the aide to use, so she turned the documents into scanned files using an Adobe application on her phone, uploading them to a Trump-owned laptop, according to people familiar with the matter.  As she worked through the thousands of pages over several days, she didn't notice there were classified documents among the presidential records, the people said.   In November 2021, after the contents in the box were scanned, the box was moved to an office in downtown Palm Beach funded by the General Services Administration, the people said.  The box remained there even after Trump's team gave 15 boxes containing classified and other federal records to the National Archives in January 2022. The Justice Department then subpoenaed for the return of all classified records in Trump's possession in May 2022, and his lawyers handed over some additional documents to Justice Department investigators who visited Mar-a-Lago and toured the space in an attempt to reclaim more documents in June.   The FBI then searched Mar-a-Lago in August while Trump was at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, retrieving more than a hundred records marked as classified in certain rooms at the club, including a bridal suite converted into Trump's office and other locations where boxes were kept. But this particular box was at the Palm Beach office during that search. When Trump returned to Mar-a-Lago last fall, along with his aide, the box was retrieved from the Palm Beach office and brought to the bridal suite at Mar-a-Lago where the aide was now working alongside Trump in a new role, people familiar with the matter said.  Tracking down the box  In November at the behest of the Justice Department, Trump's legal team hired two people to search four additional locations for classified documents: Bedminster, Trump Tower in New York, a storage unit in Florida and the Palm Beach office where the box had been for nearly a year.   During those searches, two additional classified documents were found in the storage unit, which they handed over to prosecutors.  Trump's team had hoped their searches in November -- and assertions in writing that they've scoured Trump's properties and handed over all classified records -- put to rest prosecutors' concerns.   The Trump lawyers argued that the FBI had already searched Mar-a-Lago in August. But the Justice Department demanded that Trump lawyers also do another search of the property themselves as they threatened to hold Trump in contempt.   During the December search of Mar-a-Lago, the box containing the handful of classified documents intermingled with Trump's presidential schedules was at last discovered, according to the people familiar with the search efforts.   ""When the team found the box, it was initially believed that the FBI had simply missed it during the search warrant. But upon further investigation, the legal team discovered that an aide had moved it as part of her job function,"" one source said.  By that point, the box had been moved into a closet in the suite where Trump campaign memorabilia was stored, the people said. Trump's lawyers then turned over the box to the Justice Department.  In recent weeks, prosecutors secured grand jury testimony from the two people hired to search Trump's properties last fall and have been pursuing answers from his lawyers.

Fact check: Pence falsely claims opponents admitted there weren't Chinese spy balloons over the US while he was VP,2023-02-24,"Former Vice President Mike Pence, who is now considering a run for president, was asked on Fox on Wednesday about the Biden administration's criticism of rail deregulation efforts by the Trump administration. Fox host Martha MacCallum told Pence that, in the wake of the train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, in early February, ""They're blaming the Trump administration. They say it's the regulations that you peeled back that led to this lack of safety."" Pence replied: ""Yeah, same crowd that said that Chinese balloons floated over our administration, right -- until they admitted that they didn't."" Facts First: Pence's claim is false. Neither the Biden administration nor the Pentagon has ""admitted"" that Chinese spy balloons didn't float over the United States during the Trump-Pence administration. In fact, the Biden administration and the Pentagon have said this month that Chinese spy balloons did float over the US during the Trump-Pence era. The Pentagon has briefed Congress about these suspected Trump-era incidents; former Trump administration national security officials who were briefed by the intelligence community last week have not disputed the existence of these incidents after the briefings; and CNN has viewed excerpts from a 2022 military intelligence report that said a Chinese spy balloon in 2019 ""drifted past Hawaii and across Florida before continuing its journey."" Former Trump national security adviser Robert O'Brien told CNN last week that his briefing made clear that ""nothing like"" this year's Chinese balloon incident, ""with the balloon loitering over US nuclear sites,"" took place under Trump. But O'Brien did not say the Trump-era incidents didn't happen at all. Rather, he said that ""we were not briefed during the Trump administration on this program, and most of this was discovered after we left office. Most of it quite recently.""  CNN has reported that three Chinese spy balloons are suspected to have transited over the continental US under Trump. Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said early this month that these previous suspected incursions were ""brief"" and ""nothing at all like what we saw last week in terms of duration."" Regardless, contrary to Pence's insinuation, the incursions are certainly still suspected to have occurred. Pence's explanation CNN asked Pence's team on Wednesday what he was talking about when he claimed an unnamed ""crowd"" had ""admitted"" that Chinese balloons didn't float over the US while he was vice president.  A Pence spokesperson responded Thursday by saying that Pence was noting that although the Biden administration had tried to distract from its own poor handling of the new balloon incident by claiming ""spy balloons entered the United States during the Trump administration,"" such claims ""were debunked when NORAD and other national security officials admitted these detections were not made by their agencies until after the Trump administration left office."" But if Trump-era balloon incidents were not discovered until after Trump left office, as Biden officials and the commander of the North American Aerospace Defense Command have indeed said, this belated discovery clearly does not ""debunk"" the fact that the incidents happened in the first place. The US military shot down the latest suspected Chinese spy balloon on Biden's orders over the Atlantic Ocean on February 4 after it drifted off the East Coast. The balloon had entered US airspace over Alaska on January 28, and then, after floating over Canada, returned to US airspace over Idaho on January 31, according to a senior defense official. Many Republicans, including Pence, argued that the balloon should have been shot down sooner; defense officials said they waited because they did not want to risk having falling debris harm people or property on the ground.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.928, 'pos': 0.072, 'compound': 0.1027}",21,60.0,0.04063636363636364,0.906272727272727,0.05318181818181818,0.1567625,0.061,0.881,0.057,-0.6885,3.2920125,20.86466250000001,118.0,0.17681917372881364
"Celebrities may have helped shape anti-vaccine opinions during Covid-19 pandemic, study finds",2023-02-24,"Covid-19 vaccines are known to be safe and effective, and they're available for free, but many Americans in the US refuse to get them -- and a recent study suggests that celebrities may share some of the blame for people's mistrust. Celebrities have long tried to positively influence public health, studies show, but during the Covid-19 pandemic, they also seemed to have a large influence on spreading misinformation. Decades ago, in the 1950s, people could see stars like Elvis Presley, Dick Van Dyke and Ella Fitzgerald in TV ads that encouraged polio vaccination. This celebrity influence boosted the country's general vaccination efforts, and vaccination nearly eliminated the deadly disease. In 2021, US officials used celebrities in TV ads to encourage more people to get vaccinated against Covid-19. Big names like lifestyle guru Martha Stewart, singer Charlie Puth and even Senate Minority Leader Mitchell McConnell showed up in spots that had billions of ad impressions. The world isn't restricted to only three TV networks any more, so celebrities like actress Hilary Duff, actor Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, singer Dolly Parton and even Big Bird also used their enormous presence on Instagram and Twitter to promote a pro Covid-19 vaccine message. But social media also became a vehicle for celebrities to cast doubt about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine and even to spread disinformation about Covid. Their negative messages seemed to find an audience. For their study, published in the journal BMJ Health & Care Informatics, researchers examined nearly 13 million tweets between January 2020 and March 2022 about Covid-19 and vaccines. They designed a natural language model to determine the sentiment of each tweet and compared them with tweets that also mentioned people in the public eye. The stars they picked to analyze included people who had shared skepticism about the vaccines, who had Covid-related tweets that were identified as misinformation or who retweeted misinformation about Covid. They included rapper Nicki Minaj, football player Aaron Rodgers, tennis player Novak Djokovic, singer Eric Clapton, Sen. Rand Paul, former President Donald Trump, Sen. Ted Cruz, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, TV host Tucker Carlson and commentator Joe Rogan. The researchers found 45,255 tweets from 34,407 unique authors talking about Covid-19 vaccine-related issues. Those tweets generated a total of 16.32 million likes. The tweets from these influencers, overall, were more negative about the vaccine than positive, the study found. These tweets were specifically more related to antivaccine controversy, rather than news about vaccine development, the study said. The highest number of negative comments was associated with Rodgers and Minaj. Clapton had ""very few"" positive tweets, the study said, and that may have had an influence, but he also caught flak for it from the public. The most-liked tweet that mentioned Clapton and the vaccine said, ""Strongly disagree with [EC] ... take on Covid and the vaccine and disgusted by his previous white supremacist comments. But if you reference the death of his son to criticize him, you are an ignorant scumbag."" Trump and Cruz were found to have the most substantial impact within this group, with combined likes totaling more than 122,000. They too came in for criticism on the topic, with many users wondering whether these politicians were qualified to have opinions about the vaccines. The study said the most-liked tweet mentioning Cruz was, ""I called Ted Cruz's office asking to make an appointment to talk with the Senator about my blood pressure. They told me that the Senator was not qualified to give medical advice and that I should call my doctor. So I asked them to stop advising about vaccines."" The most-liked tweet associated with Rogan was an antivaxx statement: ""I love how the same people who don't want us to listen to Joe Rogan, Aaron Rodgers about the covid vaccine, want us to listen to Big Bird & Elmo."" Posts shared by news anchors and politicians seemed to have the most influence in terms of the most tweets and retweets, the study found. ""Our findings suggest that the presence of consistent patterns of emotional content co-occurring with messaging shared by those persons in the public eye that we've mentioned, influenced public opinion and largely stimulated online public discourse, for the at least over the course of the first two years of the Covid pandemic,"" said study co-author Brianna White, a research coordinator in the Population Health Intelligence lab at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center -- Oak Ridge National Laboratory Center for Biomedical Informatics. ""We also argue that obviously as the risk of severe negative health outcomes increase with the failure to comply with health protective behavior recommendations, that our findings suggest that polarized messages from societal elite may downplay those severe negative health outcome risks."" The study doesn't get into exactly why celebrity tweets would have such an impact on people's attitudes about the vaccine. Dr. Ellen Selkie, who has conducted research on influence at the intersection of social media, celebrity and public health outcomes, said celebrities are influential because they attract a lot of attention. ""I think part of the influence that media have on behavior has to do with the amount of exposure. Just in general, the volume of content that is focused on a specific topic or on a specific sort of interpretation of that topic -- in this case misinformation -- the repeated exposure to any given thing is going to increase the likelihood that it's going to have an effect,"" said Selkie, who was not involved in the new research. She is an adolescent health pediatrician and researcher with UW Health Kids and an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. Just as people listen to a friend's thoughts, they'll listen to a celebrity whom they tend to like or identify with because they trust their opinion. ""With fandoms, in terms of the relationship between musical artists and actors and their fans, there is this sort of mutual love that fans and artists have for each other, which sort of can approximate that sense that they're looking out for each other,"" Selkie said. She said she would be interested to see research on the influence of celebrities who tweeted positive messages about the Covid-19 vaccine. The authors of the study hope public health leaders will use the findings right away. ""We argue this threat to population health should create a sense of urgency and warrants public health response to identify, develop and implement innovative mitigation strategies,"" the study says. Exposure to large amounts of this misinformation can have a lasting impact and work against the public's best interest when it comes to their health. ""As populations grow to trust the influential nature of celebrity activity on social platforms, followers are disarmed and open to persuasion when faced with false information, creating opportunities for dissemination and rapid spread of misinformation and disinformation,"" the study says.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",42,61.0,0.029,0.9215,0.049,0.2484,0.087,0.782,0.131,0.9958,10.4328,23.420662500000006,144.0,0.16264348958333338
Conservative former judge J. Michael Luttig blasts Mike Pence plan to defy subpoena,2023-02-24,"In a stern rebuke of former Vice President Mike Pence, the conservative former judge who advised Pence on how to handle the January 6, 2021, election certification vote is now warning of both the legal and political consequences of Pence's plan to fight the grand jury subpoena by special counsel Jack Smith.  ""We can expect the federal courts to make short shrift of this 'Hail Mary' claim and Mr. Pence doesn't have a chance in the world of winning his case in any federal court and avoiding testifying before the grand jury,"" former Judge J. Michael Luttig says in an op-ed published in The New York Times on Friday.  Luttig calls Pence's vow to resist the subpoena a ""dangerous gambit"" and one that will invite an ""embarrassing spectacle.""  ""No prosecutor, least of all Mr. Smith, will abide this political gambit for long,"" Luttig says. The op-ed was published the day after CNN and others reported that federal prosecutors are asking a judge to compel Pence to testify in Smith's probe.  In recent public comments, Pence has said he will fight the subpoena on the grounds that, under the Constitution's Speech or Debate Clause, the executive branch cannot compel his testimony before a grand jury.  The clause shields lawmakers from certain law enforcement actions that target their legislative conduct. Pence and his team have argued that they believe the former vice president is also covered under it in the role he was serving, during Congress' January 6, 2021, certification vote, as president of the Senate.  Luttig predicts in the op-ed that Pence's arguments will fail, writing that even if the courts find that Pence is entitled to some protections under the constitutional provision, they will ""unquestionably hold that Mr. Pence is nonetheless required to testify in response to Mr. Smith's subpoena.""  Luttig also says that Pence and his lawyers are ""mistaken"" if they think that litigation will tie up the courts for ""months and months."" ""What Mr. Smith wants to know about are Mr. Pence's communications and interactions with Mr. Trump before, and perhaps during, the vote count, which are entirely fair game for a grand jury investigating possible crimes against the United States,"" Luttig writes.  Luttig's public condemnation of Pence's claims is notable, given the counsel he gave Pence and his team that the former vice president did not have the authority to disrupt the congressional certification vote -- counsel Pence ultimately followed. Luttig has previously praised Pence for withstanding former President Donald Trump's pressure to halt the certification of President Joe Biden's win. Luttig testified before the House January 6 select committee, which was disbanded with the new Congress this year. Luttig has deep roots in the conservative legal movement. He clerked for the late Justice Antonin Scalia when Scalia was on the powerful DC federal appeals court. Luttig counts among his former clerks Republican Sen. Ted Cruz and FBI Director Chris Wray, as well as John Eastman, the attorney who spearheaded the plan to disrupt Congress certification of the 2020 results. In his op-ed, Luttig defends Smith's investigation and disputes Pence's accusation that the subpoena for his testimony is politically motivated. ""Injecting campaign-style politics into the criminal investigatory process with his rhetorical characterization of Mr. Smith's subpoena as a 'Biden D.O.J. subpoena,' Mr. Pence is trying to score points with voters who want to see President Biden unseated in 2024. Well enough. That's what politicians do,"" Luttig writes. ""But Jack Smith's subpoena was neither politically motivated nor designed to strengthen President Biden's political hand in 2024. Thus the jarring dissonance between the subpoena and Mr. Pence's characterization of it. It is Mr. Pence who has chosen to politicize the subpoena, not the D.O.J."" The former judge goes on to say that Pence's plan to fight the subpoena risks a political backlash.  Pointing to Pence's promise to take the subpoena battle to the Supreme Court, Luttig writes: ""A politician should be careful what he wishes for -- no more so than when he's a possible presidential candidate who would have the Supreme Court decide a constitutional case that could undermine his viability in an upcoming campaign.""

Judge tosses out disciplinary action against Sidney Powell for work on Trump election reversal bid,2023-02-24,"A Texas judge on Thursday dismissed the petition brought by State Bar of Texas' Commission for Lawyer Discipline alleging that attorney Sidney Powell had violated legal ethics rules with her work on former President Donald Trump's 2020 election reversal gambits. Judge Andrea Bouressa, who presides in Texas' 471st District Court, said the commission had not met its burden in proving that Powell had run afoul of Texas' attorney code of conduct. The judge also knocked the commission for not properly labeling its exhibits in its filing, leading her to only consider two of the exhibits the commission had filed.  It is possible that the dismissal order could be appealed, but a spokesperson for the disciplinary commission declined to comment. The attorney who represented Powell in the disciplinary proceedings did not respond to CNN's inquiry. The disciplinary proceedings for the ex-Trump attorney unfolded in state court in Texas, where she is licensed, after a March 1 petition from the Texas Bar's disciplinary commission asked the court to find her in violation of the professional code for attorneys in the state. As CNN previously reported, those who have sought disciplinary responses for Trump's legal allies say the post-election conduct crossed ethical lines into the realm of professional misconduct -- and that the tactics were well outside the normal bounds of legal challenges to election procedures. A number of former Trump lawyers, including Rudy Giuliani and John Eastman, have faced state bar reviews.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",8,63.0,0.038,0.88325,0.07875,-0.02134999999999999,0.026,0.907,0.066,0.7143,-0.17079999999999992,40.96841250000001,133.0,0.30803317669172936
McCarthy rewards the pro-Trump radicals who put him in power,2023-02-24,"House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is keeping his word to radicals who put him in power and rewarding those who can keep him there, paving a smooth start to his tenure that may, however, be storing up trouble down the road. The California Republican handed hard-right House members with plum committee assignments, dumped several high-profile Democrats from key panels to please the conservative media universe, launched investigations into the ""weaponization"" of government against Republicans like former President Donald Trump and gave a pass to Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene when she heckled President Joe Biden during the State of the Union address or suggested ""national divorce"" between red and blue states. He's refused to demand the resignation of New York Rep. George Santos, a serial fabulist, who might be an embarrassment but whose seat remains critical to the GOP's tiny majority.  This week, in his most stunning move yet, McCarthy is giving Fox News host Tucker Carlson exclusive access to security footage of the January 6, 2021, US Capitol insurrection. The move may fuel Carlson's false claims and conspiracies about a heinous attack on American democracy. The Fox primetime star has in the past baselessly claimed people working for the FBI orchestrated the invasion of Congress.  McCarthy is currying favor with a past critic and supremely powerful media host he'd love to get on his side as he tries to rule his conference and court the conservative base. He's already used the effort in fundraising appeals. And his move may also help whitewash Trump's culpability for the insurrection, weeks after the ex-president played a role in helping him win the speakership.  A smooth start to McCarthy's speakership  After appeasing demands from GOP holdouts and finally securing the speakership on the 15th roll call vote last month, McCarthy's opponents argue that he's now cravenly paying back the most extreme members of the most radical GOP conference in modern American history. But perhaps, he's also purchasing goodwill among his members that could give him more maneuvering room when he needs votes later in the year over critically important issues like raising the government's borrowing limit, agreeing on a budget and sending more military aid to Ukraine. Yet there's little in McCarthy's past as a Republican leader that suggests he has such political dexterity. And the most riotous members of the House GOP seem highly unlikely to accept McCarthy's concessions and fall in line. Nor does the uncompromising ideology of some of the political and media influencers he's courting suggest they'd be content to cede power to him.  And as McCarthy parries accusations that he's acting from naked political motivations, he's adopting superficially principled justifications that mock his critics. He told The New York Times he handed over the security tapes because he had ""promised"" to do so. The speaker gave such an undertaking to Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, a GOP source told CNN's Melanie Zanona, in his quest to secure the gavel, but the apparent deal did not specify that Carlson should get the footage. McCarthy suggested to the Times he was also acting in the interests of transparency. ""I was asked in the press about these tapes, and I said they do belong to the American public. I think sunshine lets everybody make their own judgment."" Except, he's not giving them to the American people so anyone can see them, or releasing them to all media, at least yet. The speaker is specifically offering access to a conservative TV host who has made no secret of his agenda. Had he wanted to create that ray of sunshine, McCarthy could have posted them online, tasked congressional committees to examine them or invited other media outlets to also view them.  The credibility of Fox News -- Carlson's television home and the apparent destiny of the tapes -- has, meanwhile, taken a hit following revelations from text messages and emails in a court filing this week that some of Fox's biggest stars and executives privately dismissed Trump's lies about voter fraud after the 2020 election but allowed them to dominate its airwaves. Just as McCarthy is apparently unwilling to challenge the power of conservative media, Fox appeared unwilling to alienate a conservative audience that wanted to believe Trump won. CNN has reached out to Fox News and Carlson with questions about how the security footage will be handled but had not received a response as of Thursday evening.   McCarthy also tried to cast his stance on Santos, who lied about large portions of his biography and career resume, as a democratic one. ""The voters of his district have elected him,"" McCarthy said of the freshman in January, suggesting that to demand the resignation of the New York Republican would be an affront to democracy -- even though it appears voters had no idea of the truth about Santos when they sent him to Washington. McCarthy has since hinted that his position could change if the House Ethics Committee ""finds something"" against Santos, who won a district that Biden carried in 2020 and that could be tough for the GOP to hold.  McCarthy's stances have led to criticism and enraged Democrats, who say his release of the footage to Carlson could endanger the security of the Capitol. But in America's bitter political climate, appealing to activist political bases is often the first consideration -- especially in the radicalized Republican Party of the Trump era. In the modern GOP, earning the anger of the media is an essential element of appealing to grassroots voters and often seems a major motivation of top party figures. McCarthy's coming dilemmas Previous Republican speakers like John Boehner and Paul Ryan tried to manage their radical right-wing conferences while staying faithful to the institutional responsibilities of their leadership position. It was a balancing act that eventually doomed their tenures. McCarthy appears to be taking the opposite tack, throwing his lot in completely with the extremists who have outsized influence due to the far-smaller-than-expected House majority the GOP managed to win in the 2022 midterms. But his accommodation of his conference might only work in the short term. In a sign of growing trouble, a border security bill that McCarthy had hoped to pass early in the new Congress is still in limbo after moderates voiced fierce opposition to a three-page draft drawn up by conservative Rep. Chip Roy from Texas. The dispute underscores the fatal flaw in the GOP majority between right-wingers keen to appeal to the base and moderates who won seats in states like New York and California, where they could face difficult reelection bids in 2024.  CNN also reported this week on bitter splits between factions of the GOP on the question of more aid for Ukraine. McCarthy has tried to finesse this divide by saying he favors support for the Kyiv government but is also against a ""blank check"" for President Volodymyr Zelensky -- in a nod to lawmakers like Gaetz and Greene who oppose multi-billion dollar US aid packages. The speaker's position is allowing him to avoid alienating either faction so far, but it will come under fierce pressure when massive requests for arms and ammunition for Ukraine arrive on Capitol Hill. McCarthy also appears to be navigating into a perilous position on a looming showdown with Biden over the need to raise the government's borrowing authority, or the debt ceiling, later this year. If the authority is not granted by Congress, the US could default on its obligations, shredding its credit rating and throwing the American and global economies into turmoil. But McCarthy is standing with the most radical members of his conference who are demanding huge spending cuts, which Biden has refused to accept, in order to lift the debt ceiling.  The California Republican may end up with a fateful choice between backing the lawmakers who elected him speaker and crashing the economy, since, if he tried to grant Biden such authority by using some Democratic votes, it's possible he'd be toppled.

Appeals court questions access that prosecutors can have to a GOP lawmaker's phone seized in 2020 election investigation,2023-02-23,"A federal appeals court on Thursday questioned the access that Justice Department prosecutors can have to a GOP lawmaker's phone seized as part of the special counsel investigation into 2020 election subversion. At a partially public hearing Thursday, the US DC Circuit Court of Appeals grappled with the scope of a constitutional provision that shields legislators from certain law enforcement actions and had tough questions for both the attorney representing Republican Rep. Scott Perry, whose phone was seized by the FBI in August, and for the Justice Department attorney arguing in favor of prosecutors being able to obtain communications from the device. Many details of the dispute remain shrouded in secrecy, including an underlying district court opinion that Perry appealed to the circuit court.  An attorney for Perry said Thursday that the files in question pertained to the discussions the Pennsylvania congressman was having about two legislative matters: a election rules reform bill Congress was considering in early 2021 and Perry's vote on the January 6, 2021, certification of the presidential election results. A lawyer for the special counsel's office did not provide that level of detail about what's at issue in the case, argued that the Justice Department should be able to access a member of Congress' cell phone records if they were making calls as informal research before a possible legislative vote. The key issue in the case is whether the Constitution's so-called Speech or Debate Clause -- which says legislators cannot be questioned on ""any Speech or Debate"" in Congress -- applies to a lawmaker's ""informal fact finding"" that was not formally authorized by Congress. Two judges on the circuit panel -- Circuit Judges Gregory Katsas and Neomi Rao, both Trump appointees -- zeroed in on this issue in their questions for DOJ attorney John Pellettieri. They seemed to balk at the hard line he drew that those kinds of informal communications were not protected by the clause. The judges, however, also grilled Rowley on whether he was pushing a virtually limitless interpretation of the Clause that would shield all sort of communications lawmakers had, including with individuals not in Congress. ""Shouldn't we put weight on the fact that what we're talking about here seems far afield from Speech or Debate?"" Katsas asked Rowley. How the DC Circuit views the 17-word constitutional provision could have implications not just for how the Trump investigations proceed, but what sort of immunity legislators have in all sorts of court proceedings going forward -- particularly if the conduct is not clearly part of their formal activities in Congress.  ""We want members of Congress to be able to do their jobs without constantly being hauled into court,"" said Elliot Williams, a former Justice Department official who also worked for the Senate Judiciary Committee. ""But it defies logic and probably the Constitution for Congress to think it can wave a wand and call everything it touches quote 'informal legislative fact-finding.'""  Perry was identified by the House January 6 committee as a player in Trump's efforts to weaponize the Justice Department. Perry did not comply with a subpoena from the committee for his testimony.  After the FBI seized Perry's phone access, he filed a public lawsuit challenging investigators' access to its contents. However, the wrangling between him and the Justice Department has played out in private court proceedings. Only the first hour or so of the roughly 90 minute hearing played out in open court, with the latter part of the proceedings taking place under seal. No 'get out of jail free card'  The Constitution's Speech or Debate Clause says that ""for any Speech or Debate in either House,"" lawmakers ""shall not be questioned in any other Place."" It functions as a separation-of-powers provision that prevents legislators from being arrested or being forced to participate in court proceedings for their legislative conduct on the congressional floor.  Courts have also said the clause extends to lawmaker conduct in congressional committee proceedings and that it also can cover congressional staff.  The Speech of Debate Clause is ""not a get out of jail free card,"" Thomas Spulak, who served as general counsel to the House of Representatives in the 1990s, told CNN this week. ""It only protects them from questioning, being subpoenaed or anything else for any legislative acts,"" Spulak said. ""What we're seeing today is a judicial analysis of what defines a legislative act."" In the judges' questions for the DOJ Thursday, the DC Circuit panel appeared sympathetic to Perry's position that informal discussions that legislators have with outside parties can amount to the type of legislative activity covered by the clause. ""Suppose a member is deliberating how to vote. They do a series of calls to key stakeholders and records the calls. You think you can get that?"" Katsas asked Pellettieri. Rao asked the DOJ lawyer: ""Why is an individual's fact finding not a precursor to legislative proceeding?"" Already, the Speech or Debate clause has been invoked in disputes arising from investigations into 2020 election subversion, including when South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham tried to resist a testimonial subpoena issued in the Fulton County grand jury probe.   Rowley, at Thursday's hearing, pointed to the Graham case and other decisions as supporting Perry's arguments. He offered the recent trail derailment in Ohio as an example of the type of matter a lawmaker would do his own research on for potential legislation even though Congress had not yet set up a formal investigation. Still, the judges hinted their wariness of interpreting the provision too broadly ""I am wondering what you think might be the limits of such a non-disclosure privilege,"" Rao asked Rowley. What kind of ""informal"" fact-finding amounts to covered legislative activity?  In seeking to block DOJ's access to Perry's phone, his lawyers have pointed specifically to a 2007 ruling concerning an FBI search of then-Rep. William Jefferson's congressional office in a bribery probe. The DC Circuit said that the Justice Department ran afoul of the constitutional clause by sorting through the Louisiana Democrat's files without his consent.  Chief Judge Beryl Howell, however, ruled under seal that in Perry's case, some of the communications on Perry's phones wouldn't fall under his legislative work because they weren't sanctioned by any legislative authority. She said that investigators could access certain materials on Perry's phone that his lawyers had argued should be withheld. Howell's ruling did, however, allow Perry to protect some of his phone contents under the Speech or Debate Clause, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN. To make her decision, Howell confidentially reviewed details about the information that was on Perry's phone that the Justice Department sought, the source said. Prosecutors still haven't gotten access to the more than 2,000 records they seek.   The DC Circuit Court of Appeals above Howell has put on hold her rulings, including investigators' ability to access Perry's phone records, as it hears arguments in the case on a much-quicker-than-usual timeline.  On Thursday, Perry's attorney said that his circumstances were parallel to the 2007 case, with the difference being this search is of a cell phone instead of an office. The judges, however, asked Rowley whether the immunity applies once a lawmaker speaks to parties outside of Congress -- and questioned whether that could theoretically cover all kinds of communications of a member of Congress using a cell phone. ""It's not the cell phone that makes this odd, it's that the communication can be to anyone in the universe,""  Katsas told Rowley. Circuit Judge Karen Henderson, the third member of the panel, participated in Thursday's hearing remotely. Henderson, an appointee of President George H.W. Bush, was on the circuit panel in the William Jefferson case and wrote a concurrence that took a much narrower view of the Speech or Debate Clause than the one embraced by the other judges on that decision. The DC Circuit is also considering whether it has the authority to intervene at this point, but the judges asked the parties to focus on the other legal questions in the case when arguing on Thursday. The House -- with the approval of both majority and minority leadership -- has sought to weigh in on the case, in a sign of how the Perry litigation could set the rules for how the immunity applies to all sorts of lawmaker activity going forward. The House's filings, however, are not public.  Spulak noted that, practically speaking, the role of a congressperson has become ""pretty broad"" over time and that their legislative duties can go beyond talking about a specific piece of legislation, ""since oversight is fundamental to the legislative process.""  In the Graham case, the US Supreme Court refused to block the Fulton County grand jury's subpoena for his testimony. The justices stressed that the lower courts that ordered his appearance had said that the Speech or Debate Clause precluded him from question about the ""informal investigative fact finding"" that was part of his legislative activity. The DC Circuit's consideration of the Perry case could flesh out what kind of informal fact-finding amounts to protected legislative activity.  ""Depending on how broad you read what a legislative act is, it could permit members of Congress to really cover lots of their conduct within the speech or Debate Clause that I think we would generally not think would be covered,"" said Neil Eggleston, a former White House counsel under President Barack Obama.

Biden nominates former MasterCard exec Ajay Banga to lead World Bank,2023-02-23,"President Joe Biden has announced that he's nominating Ajay Banga, a former MasterCard executive, to serve as president of the World Bank. In a statement, Biden said that Banga is ""uniquely equipped to lead the World Bank at this critical moment in history"" and that he has a ""proven track record managing people and systems, and partnering with global leaders around the world to deliver results.""  Banga has been the vice chairman at General Atlantic, a New York-based investment firm, since 2022. Prior to that, the 63-year-old was the CEO of MasterCard from 2010 to 2021.  ""Raised in India, Ajay has a unique perspective on the opportunities and challenges facing developing countries and how the World Bank can deliver on its ambitious agenda to reduce poverty and expand prosperity,' Biden said in the statement. Notably, the White House highlighted Banga's ""extensive experience"" in creating partnerships to address climate change and financial inclusion,"" something Biden pledged would be an important qualification for the next World Bank President. Banga would replace previous president David Malpass, who announced last week that he's stepping down a year early — serving four years of a five-year term.  Although Malpass had been praised by the World Bank and administration officials for his handling of the global challenges posed by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the Covid-19 pandemic, his tenure faced controversy following comments he made last September about climate change. During a panel, herefused to confirm during a climate panel whether he accepted the scientific consensus that burning fossil fuels were dangerously warming the planet.  After an outpouring of criticism, many opponents called for his resignation. However, he recently told CNN's Julia Chatterley that he has ""no regrets"" over his four-year tenure. ""We've achieved many of the things I wanted to...I think it's really important that institutions have energy, new energy, and this is a good time for the World Bank to do that,"" he said. Climate credentials US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen praised the decision to name Banga in a statement.  ""He has the right leadership and management skills, experience living and working in emerging markets, and financial expertise to lead the World Bank at a critical moment in its history, deliver on its core development goals, and evolve the Bank to meet global challenges like climate change,"" she said. US climate envoy John Kerry said Banga is the ""right choice"" because of his climate change credentials. Banga ""has proven his ability as a manager of large institutions and understands investment and the mobilization of capital to power the green transition,"" Kerry said in a statement.

McCarthy defends release of January 6 footage to Tucker Carlson: 'I promised',2023-02-23,"House Speaker Kevin McCarthy defended his controversial move to grant Fox News host Tucker Carlson access to security footage from the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, telling the New York Times he ""promised."" ""I was asked in the press about these tapes, and I said they do belong to the American public. I think sunshine lets everybody make their own judgment,"" he told the Times. McCarthy -- who has already been fundraising on the move -- did indeed promise to release the footage as part of his bid to become speaker, and it was something Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz had specifically been demanding. In fact, it was on a lengthy list of demands that Gaetz walked into McCarthy's office with on the Monday night before the speaker's vote, according to a GOP source familiar with the list.  But the list did not say the footage needs to go to Carlson -- that was decided later.   McCarthy could have tasked his own committees with sorting through the footage and presenting it, but a source close to McCarthy said he has long been wary of having the House GOP looking like it is investigating or relitigating the January 6 attack.  Instead, McCarthy opted to give the footage to a friendly conservative media network. Specifically, he opted to give the exclusive to Carlson, who has been one of the most vocal voices in conservative media calling for the footage to be released. Carlson has been a huge McCarthy critic -- so this move could help win the speaker some favor with Carlson's camp as McCarthy tries to hold together both the conservative and moderate wings of his Republican conference. McCarthy is hoping that outsourcing this work to the media will be a way to appease his right flank without upsetting his moderates and majority makers.  But it's a still a big risk, and McCarthy and House Republicans could still wind up taking the blame for however this plays out in the media. Already, Democrats have been quick to criticize the move by McCarthy, warning that it creates a significant security risk. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday blasted McCarthy in a letter to his Senate colleagues -- comments that marked the first time Schumer has spoken out about the move. Schumer said in the letter that, ""the speaker is needlessly exposing the Capitol complex"" and that the disclosure ""poses grave security risks to members of Congress and everyone who works on Capitol Hill."" In the letter, Schumer said McCarthy's decision to give the footage to Carlson ""laid bare that this sham is simply about pandering to MAGA election deniers, not the truth."" Carlson has been one of the most prominent promoters of January 6 conspiracy theories. Most notably, he has devoted significant airtime to the false claim that liberal ""deep state"" partisans within the FBI orchestrated the insurrection as a way to undermine former President Donald Trump. He has conducted sympathetic interviews with some of the rioters who were subsequently charged by the Justice Department. After more than a dozen news outlets, including CNN, sued for access to the videos in 2021, the chief judge of DC federal court ruled that the public has a strong interest in seeing some security footage from the attack. However, these video releases haven't been automatic or guaranteed. News outlets can request the public release of videos after they are played in open court, on a case-by-case basis.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.8, 'pos': 0.2, 'compound': 0.3612}",22,67.0,0.065,0.801,0.134,0.3182,0.08,0.785,0.136,0.9895,7.0004,20.160250000000005,152.0,0.13263322368421057
"Trump and FBI director can be deposed in lawsuit from ex-FBI agent Peter Strzok, judge rules",2023-02-23,"Former President Donald Trump and FBI Director Christopher Wray can be deposed as part of a lawsuit from an ex-FBI agent who sued over his 2018 termination, a federal judge ruled Thursday. The ruling ends a yearlong dispute over whether the former agent, Peter Strzok, could question them under oath. Strzok's lawsuit alleges that Trump's political vendetta prompted his firing and the public release of his texts, in violation of his constitutional rights and the Privacy Act. DC District Judge Amy Berman Jackson held a sealed hearing Thursday morning, after which she issued a brief ruling. As part of her ruling, Jackson said that the Biden White House must decide by late March whether the current president will assert executive privilege over conversations that Trump had directly related to Strzok's firing. The depositions also must be limited to less than two hours, Jackson ruled, and to a narrow set of topics, including the government's decision to fire Strzok. The Justice Department tried to block the subpoenas, arguing that Strzok hadn't proven Trump played a role in his dismissal. Despite Trump's repeated and public calls for Strzok's dismissal, it was FBI's then-deputy Director David Bowdich who made the decision to fire him, DOJ argued. Strzok's firing came after an internal investigation into texts he'd exchanged with former FBI lawyer Lisa Page over concerns they had with a potential Trump presidency, as the texts could be interpreted to show political bias. The messages also revealed that Strzok and Page had had an extramarital relationship. The Justice Department's inspector general issued reports on both high-profile investigations that Strzok and Page participated in -- the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of private email and the investigation into potential ties between Russia and the Trump campaign -- and cleared both probes of political bias. Page has brought her own lawsuit alleging that the Justice Department violated the Privacy Act by releasing their texts, but Jackson's order allowing Trump and Wray to be deposed only applies in Strzok's case.","{'neg': 0.112, 'neu': 0.888, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.2263}",12,68.0,0.133625,0.8225,0.043875000000000004,-0.264475,0.088,0.884,0.028,-0.889,-3.1737,17.157350000000008,156.0,0.10998301282051287
Opinion: Georgia grand juror's tacky media tour won't trash the case,2023-02-23,"Georgia special grand jury foreperson Emily Kohrs, one of the ""random people"" chosen to help with the sweeping investigation of former President Donald Trump, has garnered considerable attention by making the major media rounds. It is reminiscent of ""the full Ginsberg,"" in which Monica Lewinsky's lawyer during the Clinton impeachment stopped at every Sunday show. Perhaps we need a new coinage: ""the full Kohrs.""   It certainly would have been better for decorum if Kohrs had refrained from speaking to the media, and she may even trigger motions challenging potential indictments. But that won't change anything legally. Any such motions will fail under Georgia law because she is neither a member of the regular grand jury that would ultimately issue charges, nor of the trial jury that would adjudicate them. And for that reason, any PR damage is likely to be long forgotten before trials occur.  To review the whirlwind of the past days, after portions of the Georgia special grand jury report were released, Kohrs spoke to a series of major print and broadcast outlets. When asked on CNN about the names recommended for indictment, she stated, ""the big name that everyone keeps asking me about - I don't think you'll be shocked,"" adding that the jurors ""definitely heard a lot about former President Trump and we definitely discussed him a lot in the room,"" and that ""I am positive I have heard the president on the phone more than once.""    She also described her impressions about other witnesses, including Cassidy Hutchinson, Brad Raffensperger, Mark Meadows and Brian Kemp, in an interview with the Associated Press. And she told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the evidence considered included new audio recordings that have not yet been made public. She also provided the press with quite a bit of behind the scenes color, for example describing the popsicle she was enjoying when she swore in one witness.  After Kohrs' public statements, lawyers connected to several witnesses in the Fulton County proceedings on Wednesday suggested that they would use her remarks in an effort to quash or dismiss the indictments. The argument would presumably be that she violated the secrecy that pertains to the special grand jury proceedings and prejudiced defendants' right to a fair trial.  Such arguments are doomed under Georgia law. Georgia does instruct jurors to ""keep the deliberations of the grand jury secret."" But the state's Supreme Court has explained that ""deliberations"" are quite limited. They do not include ""all things coming to (a) person's knowledge as a result of grand jury attendance."" In fact, grand jury members are not ""bound to secrecy regarding the evidence presented to a grand jury"" -- just their discussions with each other about it.   Kohrs' statements focus on the demeanor of several GOP witnesses, the evidence presented to the grand jury and the fact that the jury concluded its investigation and made recommendations -- not ""deliberations"" to which the special grand jury is ""bound to secrecy."" Kohrs' statements did not disclose the content of discussions, even though they indicate that discussions took place.   There are also unique considerations because Kohrs was the foreperson of a special grand jury --  and a partial report about its investigation was already released. Georgia law expressly authorizes the publication of special grand jury reports and recommendations.  Thus, Kohrs' related comments raise a lessened secrecy concern than some have claimed. Georgia simply does not afford that degree of legal protection to most aspects of a grand jury's work. Indeed, since 1939, Georgia courts have recognized that general statements by grand juries, including in published recommendations, did not create a basis for dismissing an indictment.   The supervising judge, Robert McBurney, alluded to this relatively forgiving standard during oral argument on the motion to release the special grand jury report. Pressing the litigants on whether or not to keep all or portions of the report secret, he suggested that there would be nothing to stop special grand jurors from speaking out if they so chose. While he did not formally reach that conclusion, and in fact (Kohrs says) provided her with guidelines on what can and cannot be disclosed, his nod at special grand jurors' leeway is notable.   Perhaps the closest Kohrs came to disclosing deliberations was when she stated the special grand jury did not call Trump because he ""was not a battle we picked to fight."" But even there, she did not reveal the debate points the grand jurors engaged in to reach that decision. Rather, she was stating the outcome. In light of Georgia's loose restrictions, that is not enough to cross the line.   More fundamentally, like her other statements, that one does not harm the former president or anyone else. That is the final and biggest reason that Kohrs' statements cannot result in the dismissals of future indictments: no defendant's rights to a fair trial have been prejudiced. Under Georgia law, her comments to the press would have to ""(castigate, impugn a defendant's) integrity, ... and subject (him) to the odium of condemnation ... without giving him the slightest opportunity to defend himself.""    Kohrs has not done that. Rather, she mentions general recollections of witnesses and subjects of conversation and does not name individuals recommended for indictment.  Any individuals ultimately charged will be able to mount defenses in court -- and in the court of public opinion.  Nor has Kohrs revealed any prejudice in the special grand jury's already concluded deliberations. For instance, there is no hint in her remarks of special grand jurors being pressured to decide in one way or another.   The DA may now seek indictments from a regular grand jury that may have read or seen Kohrs' remarks -- but those grand jurors almost certainly have her actual report, so whatever hints Kohrs has dropped are hardly news to them. Any potential targets might argue the statements will influence the trial jurors, but that can be dealt with during jury selection by asking prospective jurors if they heard the statements and were affected by them.   Kohrs won't win any prizes for grand jury foreperson etiquette. Her display has been unseemly, to say the least.  It has violated good taste -- but not the law.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.769, 'pos': 0.231, 'compound': 0.4588}",46,69.0,0.0,0.7983333333333333,0.20166666666666666,0.8216666666666667,0.077,0.749,0.174,0.999,37.79666666666667,44.240016666666676,158.0,0.28000010548523213
Federal prosecutors seek to compel Pence to testify in special counsel probe,2023-02-23,"Federal prosecutors have asked a judge to compel former Vice President Mike Pence to testify in special counsel Jack Smith's investigation, according to a person familiar with the matter. The move comes after Pence was subpoenaed and attorneys for former President Donald Trump asserted executive privilege over Pence's testimony. The battle over the subpoena is playing out under seal in federal court in Washington, DC. Prosecutors have previously filed motions with other witnesses to overcome privilege claims in sealed court hearings. But those efforts have largely come after the witness testified before a grand jury and refused to answer certain questions citing privilege concerns. In this case, prosecutors are aiming to quash the executive privilege claims before Pence testifies.

What to know about the lawsuit aiming to ban medication abortion drug mifepristone,2023-02-11,"A federal judge could rule any day on a lawsuit seeking to block the use of medication abortion nationwide, in the biggest abortion-related case since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year. The lawsuit, filed in November by anti-abortion advocates against the US Food and Drug Administration, targets the agency's two-decade-old approval of mifepristone, the first drug in the medication abortion process.  Medication abortion, which now makes up a majority of abortions obtained in the US, has become a particularly acute flashpoint in the fallout from the Supreme Court's decision last year overturning Roe v. Wade. US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, may act at any time on a motion by the plaintiffs to temporarily block use of the medication.  Any decision that blocks access to medication abortion -- even temporarily -- will significantly disrupt abortion case nationwide, however. Reproductive rights advocates say that if Kacsmaryk ultimately sides with the plaintiffs, ""it would eliminate the most commonly used method of abortion care,"" according to NARAL Pro-Choice America.  Here's what to know about the lawsuit: What the lawsuit is seeking The lawsuit, filed last year by a coalition of anti-abortion national medical associations under the umbrella of the ""Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine"" and several doctors, is seeking a number of actions by the court, chief among them a preliminary and permanent injunction ordering the FDA ""to withdraw mifepristone and misoprostol as FDA-approved chemical abortion drugs and to withdraw defendants' actions to deregulate these chemical abortion drugs.""  ""After two decades of engaging the FDA to no avail, plaintiffs now ask this court to do what the FDA was and is legally required to do: protect women and girls by holding unlawful, setting aside, and vacating the FDA's actions to approve chemical abortion drugs and eviscerate crucial safeguards for those who undergo this dangerous drug regimen,"" the complaint reads.  The challengers are also targeting the FDA's recent moves to make the pills more accessible, which include removing the requirement that the pills be picked up in-person from an abortion provider. What FDA says  The FDA responded to the lawsuit in January by asking the judge to deny the motion for a preliminary injunction, arguing that issuing one in the matter ""would upend the status quo and the reliance interests of patients and doctors who depend on mifepristone, as well as businesses involved with mifepristone distribution.""  The agency also says a ruling against it would set a dangerous precedent. ""More generally, if longstanding FDA drug approvals were so easily enjoined, even decades after being issued, pharmaceutical companies would be unable to confidently rely on FDA approval decisions to develop the pharmaceutical-drug infrastructure that Americans depend on to treat a variety of health conditions,"" the FDA wrote. ""A preliminary injunction would interfere with Congress's decision to entrust FDA with responsibility to ensure the safety and efficacy of drugs. In discharging this role, FDA applies its technical expertise to make complex scientific determinations about drugs' safety and efficacy, and these determinations are entitled to substantial deference."" What the drug company says Danco, which makes mifepristone, also made a similar request to the FDA's in a court filing, stressing that the lawsuit could decimate the company's business.  The drug company has been allowed to intervene in the case, as the anti-abortion activists are also asking the court to halt the FDA's 2016 approval of its version of the medication abortion drug.  ""Danco is a small pharmaceutical company. It sells one drug: Mifeprex,"" lawyers for the company wrote in court papers. ""Entering the mandatory preliminary injunction plaintiffs seek would force FDA to withdraw approval for Danco's only product, effectively shuttering Danco's business.""  ""Congress entrusts decision-making like this with the FDA. And they're coming in trying to overrule that, saying this medication is unsafe because women bleed. Well, that's part of having an abortion. It's also part of having a pregnancy,"" said Ryan Brown, an attorney representing Danco in the case. ""The bottom line being that they just want to do away with abortion across the board and for any reason."" Who is the judge in the case? Kacsmaryk was appointed to the court in 2017 by then-President Trump and was confirmed by a 52-46 vote in 2019. Since then, he's helped make Texas a legal graveyard for policies of President Joe Biden's administration, presiding over 95% of the civil cases brought in Amarillo, Texas. In December, Kacsmaryk put on hold the Biden administration's most recent attempt to end the so-called ""Remain in Mexico"" program. And he has overseen Texas cases challenging vaccine mandates, the gender identity guidance issued by the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the administration's limits on the use of Covid-19 relief funds for tax cuts. Before joining the court, Kacsmaryk served as deputy general counsel at the First Liberty Institute, a nonprofit religious liberty legal group, where he worked mainly on ""religious liberty litigation in federal courts and amicus briefs in the US Supreme Court,"" according to his White House biography. Red and blue states weigh in  The case is being closely watched by a number of interested parties, including Republican and Democratic state attorneys general. In February, two different multi-state coalitions filed amicus briefs with the court urging them to act one way or another in the matter.  A coalition of 22 Democratic attorneys general urged Kacsmaryk to deny the motion for a preliminary injunction, writing in court papers that ""annulling -- or even merely limiting -- any of the FDA's actions relating to medication abortion would result in an even more drastic reduction in abortion access across the entire nation, worsening already dire outcomes, deepening entrenched disparities in access to health care, and placing a potentially unbearable strain on the health care system as a whole.""  They noted that ""the availability of mifepristone has been particularly critical in providing access to abortion in low-income, underserved, and rural communities where procedural abortion may be unavailable,"" adding that since the drug is used more during the first trimester of a pregnancy, ""eliminating access to this method will result in more abortions taking place later in pregnancy, further increasing costs and medical risks."" The Democratic attorneys general noted that abortion clinics in their states have already seen a surge in patients because of traffic from residents of states where extreme abortion restrictions are in effect. Cutting off access to medication abortion would further overburden those clinics, the blue states argued, as surgical abortion would be the only available method. A coalition of 22 Republican attorneys general, meanwhile, asked the court to issue the preliminary injunction, arguing the FDA exceeded its authority when it approved the medication.  ""State laws on chemical abortion thus account for the public interests at issue -- and they do so with the benefit of democratic legitimacy (and legal authority). The FDA's actions can make no such claim. By obstructing the judgments of elected representatives, the agency has undermined the public interest,"" they wrote. What abortion-rights advocates are saying  Abortion rights advocates have sounded the alarm on the case, stressing that a ruling by Kacsmaryk in favor of the plaintiffs would affect every corner of the country since the lawsuit is targeting a federal agency.  ""If FDA approval of mifepristone is revoked, 64.5 million women of reproductive age in the US would lose access to medication abortion care, an exponential increase in harm overnight,"" NARAL said in a statement in February, pointing to internal research. ""This research reveals the high stakes of this lawsuit, and we can only expect the worst from this Trump-appointed federal judge. Americans want access to abortion, but anti-choice bad actors are dead set on restricting reproductive freedom by any means possible,"" said Angela Vasquez-Giroux, the group's vice president of communications and research.  And activists quickly mobilized in Texas around the issue, with the Women's March holding a rally at the federal courthouse in Amarillo, Texas, in February to protest the suit.  ""We've said it before: the fight for reproductive rights now lies in the states, and legal challenges like these are just the latest example of how our fight is bigger than Roe,"" said Rachel Carmona, the executive director of Women's March.  Judge decides against fast-tracking trial Kacsmaryk had been considering whether to consolidate a potential hearing on the preliminary injunction request with a trial on the merits of the lawsuit, a move that would have fast-tracked the entire case.  He asked the parties to weigh in, with both the plaintiffs and Danco voicing support for the consolidation. The FDA, however, urged the judge not to fast-track the trial, saying in a brief that because of the plaintiffs' ""extreme delay in filing suit to challenge FDA's approval of the drug, there is no reason to decide this case on an emergency basis.""  Kacsmaryk ultimately decided against fast-tracking the trial, writing in a February 21 order: ""Having considered the briefing and relevant law, the court determines that consolidation would not be appropriate in this case.""  When will Kacsmaryk rule?  Kacsmaryk told the plaintiffs that they had until February 24 to file a joint response to briefs submitted by the FDA and Danco.  In an earlier order, the judge said that following the deadline, ""briefing will then be closed on the matter, absent any 'exceptional or extraordinary circumstances.'"" Now that the response is in, Kacsmaryk can rule at any time, though he could also call for a hearing, or ask for additional responses as well. And because he decided against fast-tracking the trial in the case, his first ruling will only be on the preliminary injunction request, which, if granted in full, would temporarily pull the abortion drug from the market. Any decision that blocked access to medication abortion -- even temporarily -- will significantly disrupt abortion case nationwide, however. Potential Supreme Court showdown A day before the plaintiffs submitted their brief, 12 states led by liberal attorneys general sued the FDA, saying its limits on mifepristone are too strict. The suit creates the possibility of circuit courts offering conflicting takes about the safety of abortion medication and how accessible the drug should be, something that would increase the likelihood of the Supreme Court weighing in.   The lawsuit was filed in federa","{'neg': 0.333, 'neu': 0.667, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.6705}",58,71.0,0.12933333333333333,0.86,0.010666666666666666,-0.4518,0.061,0.856,0.082,0.9744,-26.2044,17.947366666666678,145.0,0.1237749425287357
Fury over Biden's new asylum policy grows after he thanks Poland for welcoming Ukrainian refugees,2023-02-23,"The split screen was striking. President Joe Biden in Warsaw, Poland, expressed unequivocal support for refugees borne out of Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine. Back home, his administration just hours later announced its toughest policy yet aimed at turning away migrants, many of whom are fleeing persecution and economic ruin in their home countries.  From behind a podium adorning the iconic seal of the US presidency and in front of a set of American, Ukrainian and Polish flags, Biden on Tuesday had delivered a stirring message: America would forever stand with Ukraine on the side of democracy and freedom.  Critical in that fight for freedom, Biden said in remarks ahead of the one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, was taking care of the millions of Ukrainians whose homes, families and livelihoods have been destroyed over the last year.  ""Look at what you've done so far. Poland is hosting more than 1.5 million refugees from this war. God bless you,"" Biden told the crowd gathered at the Royal Castle. ""Poland's generosity -- your willingness to open your hearts and your homes -- is extraordinary."" Back at home, that show of appreciation to the Polish people struck a nerve. While the two populations -- refugees fleeing war and asylum seekers -- are different, the contrast between Biden's own words aimed at refugees in Europe and his administration's newly announced policy on the US border did not go unnoticed among immigration and human rights advocates and Democratic lawmakers alike, some of whom were quick to express their dismay.  One senior Democratic aide, who asked for anonymity to speak freely, bluntly described the situation as a ""real contradiction."" ""You see the president really highlighting how many refugees Poland has taken,"" the aide said. ""And then on the same day, there's a rollout to very actively reduce the number of people who can even access our asylum system."" One immigration activist went as far as to say that they found some of Biden's words in the Warsaw speech ""deeply offensive,"" when heard in the context of his administration's new move to ban thousands of people -- fleeing persecution and hardships in their home countries -- from seeking asylum in the US.  ""Freedom. There is no sweeter word than freedom. There is no nobler goal than freedom,"" Biden had said in Warsaw. Advocates have noted that some of the very modern protections that are in place for displaced people date back to the atrocities of World War II. On Tuesday afternoon, the Homeland Security and Justice Departments announced the administration's most restrictive policy yet aimed at curbing the number of migrants seeking to apply for asylum at the US-Mexico border. The newly proposed rule -- which would take effect in May and is reminiscent of a controversial policy dating back to Donald Trump's administration -- largely bars migrants who traveled through other countries on their way to the US southern border from applying for asylum in the US. It marks a significant departure from longstanding protocol, which allows migrants to request asylum regardless of how they arrived on US soil. Immigrant advocates and former Biden officials have slammed the new policy, calling it a pivot from Biden's pledge to restore asylum and a move toward Trump-era policies. Biden has long promised to take a humane approach to the situation at the border -- a promise that some critics say the current White House could risk breaking with some of their restrictive border policies.  Anu Joshi, deputy director of the National Political Advocacy Department at the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement: ""This asylum ban is, at its core, Trump's asylum ban under a different name."" Administration officials have cited new programs that allow certain migrants to apply to come to the US and underscored efforts to expand access to legal pathways in their defense of the rule. The administration has also argued that the measure is part of a broader effort to establish order in an immigration system that has been under immense strain, and address migrants with valid claims of asylum, which are determined on a case-by-case basis.  Still, the announcement served yet another reminder of how the situation at the US border has proven to be one of the thorniest political problems for the Biden White House. For the first half of the president's first term in office, Biden and his top advisers grappled with Title 42 -- a Trump-era border restriction that the administration has both publicly criticized and leaned on to quell the flow of migrants arriving at the US border. The policy is the subject of ongoing litigation.  With that policy set to expire in May, finding and enforcing other measures to restrict the thousands of migrants arriving at the US border has only grown in urgency for the White House -- particularly as Republican lawmakers have been eager to paint Biden as weak on border enforcement.  But the patchwork of policies rolled out by the administration in recent weeks has put the president squarely at odds with his own allies.  Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus had previously voiced frustration with the administration when officials previewed the rule last month, saying they were blindsided by the new border policies and disappointed over what they've said is a lack of direct engagement by the White House.  The administration tried to correct course in private meetings last week with lawmakers about the anticipated release of the new asylum rule. But in one closed-door meeting with Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, Democratic Hispanic senators maintained their strong opposition and expressed their ongoing concerns, according to a source familiar with the meeting.  Among those in the room was Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey. The senator -- who had previously written a letter to the president to share his concerns -- condemned the proposed asylum rule on Tuesday in a joint statement with Democratic Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico, and Alex Padilla of California. ""We are deeply disappointed that the administration has chosen to move forward with publishing this proposed rule, which only perpetuates the harmful myth that asylum seekers are a threat to this nation. In reality, they are pursuing a legal pathway in the United States,"" the statement said.  ""We have an obligation to protect vulnerable migrants under domestic and international law and should not leave vulnerable migrants stranded in countries unable to protect them,"" it continued. In a statement, Luis Miranda, a Homeland Security spokesperson, said the proposal ""is part of a first-of-its-kind plan that expands legal pathways and has already reduced illegal immigration all while allowing thousands of individuals to lawfully enter the United States without having to put their lives in the hands of smugglers.""","{'neg': 0.172, 'neu': 0.558, 'pos': 0.27, 'compound': 0.2732}",42,72.0,0.07875,0.87,0.051250000000000004,-0.2318,0.073,0.849,0.077,-0.1076,-9.7356,1.2113666666666791,165.0,0.007341616161616237

Winter storms More than 850,000 power outages have been reported in winter storms across the US today, with more snow, icing and blizzard conditions ahead. The wintry weather has already closed roads and hampered air travel across the Midwest, with more than 40 inches of snow dumped in Wyoming and 32 inches in Montana over the past two days. More than 60 million people are currently under winter weather alerts from the West into the northern Plains, Great Lakes region and New York and New England. Out West, in an extremely rare event, some parts of Southern California will be under blizzard warnings beginning Friday -- the first blizzard alert of its kind since 1989. Meanwhile, the Southeast is basking in unseasonably high temperatures, with dozens of record highs expected today from Florida to as far north as Ohio. 2. Ohio toxic train Nearly three weeks since the toxic train wreck in a small Ohio community, the National Transportation Safety Board is expected to release its preliminary report on the derailment today. The report comes amid mounting questions about how Norfolk Southern, the train's operator, has handled the incident and the mechanical failures that may have preceded it. Residents of East Palestine, Ohio, voiced their frustrations during a CNN town hall Wednesday night where they spoke to both Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine and Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw, demanding answers about the derailment and the cleanup. Still, residents remain concerned about the impacts of chemicals lingering in the land, air and groundwater. Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump on Wednesday visited the site of the derailment -- and criticized the Biden administration's handling of the disaster. 3. Florida shooting Police are searching for a motive in a Florida shooting spree that killed three people, including a journalist covering one of the shootings. One of the victims was a 9-year-old girl who was fatally shot nearby before the gunman was arrested, authorities said. The 19-year-old suspect was taken into custody Wednesday afternoon, ending a spate of violence that stretched across several hours in a neighborhood just west of Orlando. Spectrum News 13, a CNN affiliate, mourned their slain colleague during a newscast Wednesday. ""These are people that this afternoon we were having regular conversations here in the newsroom,"" anchor Greg Angel said. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre also released a statement, saying, ""Our hearts go out to the family of the journalist killed today and the crew member injured in Orange County, Florida, as well as the whole Spectrum News team."" 4. Spy balloon The Pentagon on Wednesday released a selfie taken by a US pilot showing the Chinese spy balloon in the air before it was shot down days later. The photo shows the shadow of the aircraft on the balloon, which was floating at 60,000 feet when it was spotted over Montana. It also shows a clear image of the balloon's payload as it crossed across the continental US. The balloon was first spotted by the US on January 28 and ultimately shot down by the US military off the coast of South Carolina. Investigations began immediately after the balloon was retrieved from the Atlantic Ocean earlier this month. Pieces of the debris were transferred to the FBI Laboratory in Virginia to be studied further. The Pentagon also said Wednesday that the payload of the balloon had been recovered and is being investigated. 5. ChatGPT Vanderbilt University is facing criticism for using the artificial intelligence tool ChatGPT to write an email about a mass shooting at another university. Last Friday, the university emailed its student body to address the tragedy at Michigan State University that killed three students and injured others. However, at the end of the school's email was a surprising line: ""Paraphrase from OpenAI's ChatGPT AI language model, personal communication, February 15, 2023,"" read a parenthetical in a smaller font. Following an outcry from students and the public alike, a school spokesperson issued an apology the following day. This comes as many schools and even companies have banned the use of the powerful chatbot, which can turn written prompts into convincing academic essays and creative scripts in seconds. JPMorgan Chase also recently announced it will ban employee use of ChatGPT due to compliance concerns.

First on CNN: Former Trump national security advisers among witnesses testifying at House hearing on China,2023-02-23,"The House select committee on China will feature four high-profile witnesses during its first hearing Tuesday at 7 p.m. ET, including former President Donald Trump's national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, and top China expert and former deputy national security adviser, Matthew Pottinger, sources familiar with the hearing told CNN.  This is the first primetime hearing that any GOP-led committee has held since Republicans took over the House majority in January. The panel's top Republican, Chairman Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, is hoping to make a splash with his witness list, which is aimed at proving his panel's commitment to leading a serious, bipartisan investigation that could result in substantial legislative action, the sources said.  Other witnesses include Tong Yi, former secretary to one of China's leading dissidents and current human rights activist, Wei Jingsheng, and Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing. The witnesses will help the committee lay out what they view are the specific threats China poses as a global competitor, as well as the panel's top priorities on how to counter Beijing's aggression.  McMaster and Pottinger are significant witnesses for the committee to showcase. They are widely respected on both sides of the aisle and played key roles in how the Trump administration formulated and carried out its agenda toward China.  Pottinger, in particular, worked for Trump from the start of his administration until resigning in the immediate aftermath of the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot. He testified publicly last year before the House select committee on the January 6 attack, earning him a nod of approval from the left.  ""Our national security was harmed in a different way by the sixth of January and that is, I think it emboldened our enemies by helping give them ammunition to feed a narrative that our system of government doesn't work, that the United States is in decline,"" Pottinger said at the hearing. ""China, the Putin regime in Russia, Tehran, they're fond of pushing those kinds of narratives -- and by the way, they're wrong.""  Meanwhile, Tong will be a crucial witness who can speak personally to one of the committee's top priorities -- highlighting China's human rights abuses and why the US must do more to curb its global influence. Tong was arrested and imprisoned for her involvement with Jingsheng and the democracy movement in 1993, and was later released in 1996 before going into exile in the US.  Paul is expected to outline the reasoning for reducing Beijing's role in the US economy and preventing American companies from ending up in the hands of Chinese state-owned firms and investors. He's also been a leading voice on increasing domestic manufacturing, and can speak to why the panel believes the US must stop China's leverage at every angle.  Tuesday's hearing is the committee's first test to showcase what the panel is setting out to do: leading serious investigations in a bipartisan way that can get the backing of the majority of the public.   Both Gallagher and Illinois Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, the committee's highest ranking Democrat, have publicly touted the panel's efforts to remain bipartisan in tone and practice, and both have pointed to the types of members on the panel as proof that their work will be a departure from the highly politicized investigations other top committees are conducting.  ""We're not going to turn this into a partisan, bomb-throwing committee,"" Gallagher recently told CNN. ""Now, there may be meaningful disagreement on the issues. There are plenty of areas where Democrats and Republicans disagree on China, but overall, I think everyone's trying to row in the same direction.""  That commitment to bipartisanship, however, was recently tested by the controversial approach the Biden administration took in handling the Chinese spy balloon that recently flew over the US. How the committee addresses that approach will be a key sign of whether they can honor their vow to remain civil and work together.   McMaster and Pottinger will likely take questions on Tuesday about what the Trump administration knew regarding the transiting of three suspected Chinese spy balloons over the continental US during Trump's time in office. Committee aides told CNN to watch the line of questioning from different members as a sign of whether the panel can remain unified on the public stage.  Taiwan center stage  While Tuesday's hearing is expected to largely focus on China's human rights abuses, one of the most pressing issues the committee will ultimately delve into is how the US should defend Taiwan against growing Chinese aggression in the region.  The hearing comes after a congressional delegation, led by select committee member Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, traveled to Taiwan where they met with top officials to discuss the threats posed by China.  Khanna worked extremely hard to ensure that this trip was not seen as overly provocative to China, focusing on the economic relationship and publicly stating his interest in visiting China as well, according to an aide, who noted that it was not cancelled in the wake of the Chinese spy balloon incident because he believed it would send the wrong message.  The congressman met with Morris Chang, the founder of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, who, according to the aide, typically does not meet with delegations, but wanted to meet with Khanna because of his Silicon Valley ties and the role as a co-author of the CHIPS and Science Act.  Addressing challenges posed by China's role in the semiconductor supply chain is a top priority for the China select committee and has bipartisan support, according to sources familiar with the matter.  Khanna told CNN in a phone interview Wednesday that he hopes the committee will have the opportunity to hear directly from top officials like CIA Director Bill Burns and discuss strategies for avoiding conflict with China at a time of potentially increasing tensions.  ""The committee is working in a way that is consistent with American foreign policy,"" he said, pointing to the work of former Presidents Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter that has ""stood the test of time for almost 50 years and avoided conflict in the straights.""  ""It would behoove us to understand the rationale behind that policy, the delicate balance the US has managed to strike,"" Khanna added, noting it would be helpful for the panel to address those topics, including the administration's policy related to Taiwan, with Burns and Secretary of State Antony Blinken in particular. Senior US national security officials, including Burns, have increasingly warned that the Chinese military has been ordered by President Xi Jinping to prepare for a potential invasion of Taiwan -- a move that would dramatically escalate tensions and increase the risk of conflict with the US.     ""We clearly see indications of Xi instructing his military to be ready"" for an invasion later in this decade, Burns said at the Munich Security Conference, referring to Taiwan.  While ""that doesn't mean that an invasion is going to occur,"" it underscores how the ""risks increase the farther you get into this decade and beyond,"" he added.

Companies can no longer silence laid-off employees in exchange for severance,2023-02-22,"If your company lays you off, your employer might offer you severance pay — but only if you agree to adhere to a number of restrictions.  Staying quiet is often one of them.  But the National Labor Relations Board this week put employers on notice that they can no longer silence laid-off employees in two very specific ways that the board says violates employees' rights under sections 7 and 8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act. Employers can no longer include a broadly written confidentiality clause that requires you to keep mum about the terms of your severance agreement. And they can no longer include a broadly written non-disparagement clause that prohibits you from discussing the terms and conditions of your employment with third parties. ""A severance agreement is unlawful if it precludes an employee from assisting coworkers with workplace issues concerning their employer, and from communicating with others, including a union, and the Board, about his employment,"" the board wrote in its decision Tuesday. The ruling is a reversal of what the Trump-era NLRB members had decided in a prior case were lawful restrictions on employees as a condition of receiving severance. With the exception of railroads and airlines, US business employers are subject to the NLRB's authority.  While the labor board's ruling this week could be appealed, the ruling is effective immediately. That means employers must review — and, if necessary, revise — their severance agreements to ensure they don't include overly broad language that would restrict workers' rights in the two ways the board ruling indicates.  The board's decision will give back a bit of power to employees, but how it plays out remains to be seen. ""Companies are definitely incentivized to silence their departing employees...[because it helps them keep] all the skeletons in the closet,"" employment attorney Alex Granovsky told CNN via email.  ""This decision opens the door. While on the one hand sunlight is the best medicine, and greater exposure should lead to better companies, this decision could also change the dynamics of a severance negotiation."" -- CNN's Chris Isidore contribute to this report","{'neg': 0.18, 'neu': 0.82, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.296}",15,75.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.045,0.806,0.149,0.9914,0.0,-73.93169999999998,202.0,-0.36599851485148505
Capitol rioter who tweeted threat to Rep. Ocasio-Cortez sentenced to 38 months in prison,2023-02-22,"A Texas man was sentenced to more than three years in prison Wednesday for assaulting police officers during the US Capitol riot and threatening Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Twitter shortly after the attack.  Garret Miller, 36, pleaded guilty in December to charges related to his conduct on January 6, 2021. He was arrested weeks after the riot -- on Inauguration Day -- while wearing a shirt that said: ""I was there, Washington, D.C., January 6, 2021.""  According to court documents, Miller brought gear with him to DC, including a rope, a grappling hook and a mouth guard, and prosecutors said he was ""at the forefront of every barrier overturned, police line overrun, and entryway breached within his proximity that day."" Miller was detained twice during the riot, according to court documents.  When he left the Capitol building, he took the fight to Twitter, according to court documents. In response to a tweet from Ocasio-Cortez calling for then-President Donald Trump's impeachment, Miller responded: ""Assassinate AOC.""  ""At the time that I tweeted at the Congresswoman, I intended that the communication be perceived as a serious intent to commit violence against the Congresswoman,"" Miller said in court documents as part of his guilty plea. He also levied threats against the officer who shot and killed a pro-Trump rioter during the melee, according to court documents, saying that he wanted to ""hug his neck with a nice rope."" Clint Broden, Miller's laywer, said in a statement to CNN that the sentence ""ultimately reflects Judge Nichols careful consideration of the case,"" and said that his client ""has expressed his sincere remorse for his actions.""

"CNN town hall on toxic train disaster in East Palestine, Ohio",2023-02-21,"Our live coverage has ended. You can read more about today's town hall by scrolling through the posts below.  Residents of East Palestine, Ohio, asked their questions directly to officials during a CNN town hall — but were left with mixed feelings about the future of their town after a train carrying toxic chemicals derailed earlier this month.  ""I don't believe what they're saying,"" said resident Nene Stewart.  Jessica Conard, who is a lifelong resident of the town, warned other communities in Ohio and beyond. ""If you have a train near you or a waterway near you, this is a problem for you too,"" she said. ""Stand up, stand with us and we're gonna fight until the promises are kept."" Andris Baltputnis, however, had a more optimistic view, saying, ""I was very encouraged. Everything was in the positive direction and I think good things are on the horizon."" ""I feel confident to bet on ourselves. I think that's what I took today, we have the one opportunity in our life to rewrite the greatest comeback story in American history and we have the pen. So, if we're betting on us, I'm happy it's East Palestine residents that get it,"" said DJ Yokley, another resident and small business owner. Here are the other key moments from the town hall: Safety assurances: Experts doubled down on their reassurances that assessments of the air and water have come back normal so far. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said he felt it was safe enough to stay in the area overnight. EPA Administrator Michael Regan said while he understands the skepticism by families ""as a father,"" he would raise his children in the community based on air readings that indicate safe levels.
Health concerns: Courtney Newman, a mother and teacher in East Palestine, Ohio, said she has been experiencing a rash and her son has been getting bloody noses since returning to her home near the crash site. Ohio Department of Health Director Dr. Bruce Vanderhoff acknowledged that dealing with potential toxic exposures “may not be in the wheelhouse” of many physicians. He said toxicologists are available to provide expert advice and a clinic has been set up in the community to help people who may not have a doctor.
Norfolk Southern: The rail company's CEO Alan Shaw apologized to East Palestine residents for the train derailment disaster. He said the company is going to review the results of the NTSB's investigation as well as use data to ""figure out what we could've done better,"" though he declined to answer any questions about that investigation. Shaw also said the company has already implemented new internal safety measures.
Ripping out tracks: Shaw said Norfolk Southern plans to rip up the tracks where the train derailed and remove soil underneath. He said this effort is expected to start at the beginning of March. Shaw said they will also continue to monitor testing from various agencies and contractors and are setting up groundwater testing in and around the site.
Small businesses: Ohio's governor said he is working with federal officials to see what assistance they can provide to help small businesses in East Palestine, but there has not been a concrete solution. DeWine told a small business owner the most important thing they can do right now is to get the ""clean up done as fast as we can,"" adding that he spoke to President Joe Biden.
Fear and anger: Jim Stewart, who has lived in East Palestine, Ohio, for 65 years, said he is angry after the train derailment earlier this month. Speaking passionately and directly to Shaw, Stewart said Norfolk Southern took away his sense of safety. ""Did you shorten my life, now? I want to retire and enjoy it. How are we gonna enjoy it? You burned me,"" he said. East Palestine Mayor Trent Conaway said, ""there's a lot of fears in town,"" especially from people who live close to the train tracks where the crash happened. He vowed to get answers to ease those anxieties.  As Wednesday's CNN town hall wrapped up, residents of East Palestine gave their final thoughts to CNN's Jake Tapper.  DJ Yokley, who was outspoken on small businesses and raising children in the village, said the residents of East Palestine now have a chance to participate in a great recovery story after the train derailment earlier this month.  ""As a leader in the community, watching leaders across our state and our federal, I feel confident to bet on ourselves,"" Yokley said, noting that the east Ohio town had a chance to write ""the greatest comeback story in American history.""  He added: ""If we're betting on us, I'm happy it's East Palestine residents that get it."" Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw declined to answer questions regarding the ongoing National Transportation Safety Board investigation or details relating to what caused the train derailment. ""I'm prohibited from talking about the ongoing investigation,"" Shaw said. ""What I can do and what I am doing and the commitment that I'm making is we're going to get the environmental cleanup right. We're going to support the citizens and the family members here and we're going to invest in the longterm growth of this community and help East Palestine thrive."" He said he is looking forward to the investigation's findings.  Jim Stewart, who has lived in East Palestine, Ohio, for 65 years, said he no longer feels safe in his town after the train derailment earlier this month. ""I'm angry about this,"" he told Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw. ""I don't feel safe in this town now, you took it away from me. You took this away from us,"" Stewart said. He said he lives very close to the derailment site and although there has been testing of the air quality around his property he said he is ""afraid to put my dog out just to pee."" Stewart said he feels a sense of loss and he worries about the value of his home and his ability to retire in the coming years.  ""I don't call it a derailment, I call it a disaster,"" Stewart said. ""Did you shorten my life, now? I want to retire and enjoy it. How are we gonna enjoy it? You burned me,"" he said. He talked about the uncertainty of if it is safe to do things around his home, from mowing the grass to planting vegetables. In response, Shaw said he is going to ""make it right"" by cleaning up the chemicals, reimbursing residents and making investments to improve the safety of trains. Watch:  Since the train derailment earlier this month, Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw said the company has already implemented new safety measures to prevent future incidents.  Shaw said that ""in the immediate aftermath,"" the company has tested and calibrated wayside detectors across its system and said it will continue to do so.  When asked by a resident if safety measures would be made public, Shaw said ""it is an internal component to Norfolk Southern."" Another resident pushed back, asking ""don't you think people would want to see that happening?"" Shaw answered, saying the company ""can certainly take videos"" of new safety measures being implemented and post them. Alan Shaw, Norfolk Southern CEO, said the company plans to take a series of measures moving forward to minimize the long-term impacts of chemicals on the land and groundwater, including ripping up the tracks where the train derailed and removing soil underneath. He said ""we've exited the emergency phase"" and are now working with the Environmental Protection Agency on a ""long-term remediation plan."" Initially, Shaw said they felt like they had an ""environmentally sound plan based on engineering principles"" to deal with the soil where the chemicals spilled, but after pushback from the community, Norfolk Southern decided to remove the tracks completely. He said this effort is expected to start at the beginning of March. Shaw said they will also continue to monitor testing from various agencies and contractors and are setting up groundwater testing in and around the site. Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw apologized to East Palestine residents for the train derailment disaster.  ""I'm terribly sorry for what has happened to your community,"" he said during the CNN town hall Wednesday night. ""I want you to know that Norfolk Southern is here, and we're going to stay here. And we're going to make this right."" He said the company is going to review the results of the NTSB's investigation as well as using data to ""figure out what we could've done better.""  ""There's always more that we can do,"" he said. ""And I'm committed to making Norfolk Southern a safer railroad."" East Palestine, Ohio, Mayor Trent Conaway is calling for answers to ease fears in the community following the derailment of a train carrying toxic chemicals. ""There's a lot of fears in town,"" especially from people who live close to the train tracks where the crash happened, he said. ""They're justified and they need answers,"" Conaway said during the CNN town hall. ""And we'll get those answers."" He said he is cautiously optimistic that the community will bounce back, pointing to assurances from officials and experts.  ""This is going to be a very long process, and you know, eventually, hopefully it comes to an end and hopefully it goes back to the way it was, and actually better than the way it was. That's our main goal,"" Conaway said. While he said he understands the hesitation of East Palestine, Ohio, residents to bring their families back to their homes, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan said he would raise his children in the community. ""Yes, I would based on the evidence that we have,"" he said in response to a question from town resident DJ Yokley, who asked if Regan would feel safe raising his kids in East Palestine. ""I understand the skepticism, as a father. I'm a father first and foremost, I understand the skepticism, but what I can tell you is what the science tells us and that these readings are indicating that there are safe levels,"" Regan said. Regan laid out various types of air monitoring the EPA has been doing around the site where a train carrying toxic chemicals derailed. This includes an airplane, a mobile van moving in and out of the area and several air quality monitors placed ""strategically all around the community."" He said his agency has tested the air quality inside more than 550 home and are working with state officials to test the water. ""What the science tells us is that we haven't had any readings that are above certain levels that would cause adverse health impacts,"" Regan said. Norfolk Southern has been ordered by the Environmental Protection Agency to fully clean up its toxic train wreck and pay for the fallout in East Palestine, Ohio.  EPA Administrator Michael Regan told CNN Wednesday the company will take care of the incident ""in a very prescribed manner on a specific timeframe."" Here's what that looks like: According to special authority by the EPA, Norfolk Southern is required to provide the agency with a descriptive cleanup plan for contaminated soil and water as well as debris, Regan said.
The company will also reimburse the EPA for providing all East Palestine residents with an interior and exterior cleaning service of their homes and businesses. 
Norfolk Southern representatives will also be compelled to ""show up at EPA's request to public meetings and explain and talk to the residents about what they're doing during this process.""
And should Norfolk Southern fail to meet the EPA's orders, Regan said the agency will ""step in"" and could charge the company up to three times the amount that the cleanup would cost.  ""There are a lot of incentives built in here, in this order, to compel the company to clean up their mess,"" he said.  Ohio's governor said he is working with federal officials to see what assistance they can provide to help small businesses in East Palestine, Ohio, recover after a train carrying toxic chemicals derailed in the town. DJ Yokley, a small business owner in East Palestine, Ohio, pressed Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine on the issue saying businesses were ""affected overnight."" Yokley, who is the founder and CEO of Your Sports Network, told the governor that businesses need a plan to ""be open at full capacity."" DeWine said he talked to President Joe Biden about what to do to assist small businesses, but there wasn't a concrete solution. ""I'm not sure what we can do, but we're certainly going to look at that and see if there is anything, certainly, that we can do,"" he said, adding that it is a ""tough time"" for the community.
""Probably the most important thing we can do is get the clean up done as fast as we can,"" DeWine said. He said he hopes this gives residents more confidence. ""It's not going to happen overnight,"" DeWine said. Yokley responded to DeWine saying he understands the cleanup will not be a quick turnaround.  ""We understand it's not going to happen overnight. Our businesses were built overnight, but they were affected overnight, sir,"" Yokley said. ""I think the biggest thing is there's a lot of people in the town — business owners as well — that need either to get back in the game or get out of town. I would love to stay in my town, but obviously we need to be able to be open at full capacity."" Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said he will tell the residents of East Palestine ""the best information"" regarding the incident in an attempt to alleviate their skepticism. ""Sometimes we don't know all the information,"" he said. ""Sometimes we get facts that maybe are wrong – but there's no way in the world I'm going to convey to you or to any other citizen a fact that I think is wrong."" Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said he would stay in East Palestine, Ohio, overnight until the clean up is done. Resident Ben Ratner pressed the governor about having been to the site of the toxic train derailment for only a few hours at a time, DeWine was insistent he felt it was safe to stay in the area overnight.  Many people who live in the area have been anxious about returning to their homes and the potential long-term effects on the air and water, though experts have said assessments have come back normal so far. Here's how the exchange played out: Ratner: ""Would you stay in East Palestine?""
DeWine: ""Yes.""
Ratner: ""Until the clean up is done, you'll stay with us, within the 1 mile?""
DeWine: ""Yes. Yes, I have been there three times.""
Ratner: ""For a few hours. Will you stay overnight for a period of time?""
DeWine: ""Yeah.""
Ratner: ""OK. Hopefully we hold you to that."" Courtney Newman, a mother and teacher in East Palestine, Ohio, said she has been having some health issues after returning to her home after a train carrying toxic chemicals derailed her house. She said she lives a street away from the crash site. Her family was evacuated, but once that order was lifted and she came back to her house, she noticed that her son had been getting bloody noses every day. Newman said she was also seeing rashes on herself. ""I took him to the pediatrician on Friday. I was told they had no guidance from the CDC, the Health Department — there was nothing they could do,"" she said. Newman said doctors told her they were ""in the dark as much as you are."" Ohio Department of Health Director Dr. Bruce Vanderhoff acknowledged that dealing with potential toxic exposures “may not be in the wheelhouse” of many physicians. He said if anyone feels like they are not able to get the evaluation they feel they need, the state is making additional resources available. Patients can ask their doctor to call the county Health Department to get connected to toxicologists who can provide expert advice, according to Vanderhoff. The Health Department also set up a clinic to help residents who may not have a doctor or just need additional support, he said. FOR CONTEXT: CNN is sharing the stories of Ohio residents who tell us their health has been impacted by the Norfolk Southern train derailment. From a medical perspective, definitively linking chemicals to health effects – such as a rash, headache or nausea – is challenging. In some cases, it could take years to establish a definitive connection, or it turn out that one does not exist. Nene Stewart, an East Palestine resident, is relying on water bottles because she still is unsure about the safety of her home's water.  ""I'm not trusting what they are saying,"" Stewart told Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine Wednesday evening. ""So, I don't know who is telling the truth."" According to the Environmental Protection Agency, municipal water sample results in the city have shown ""no water quality concerns.""  DeWine told Stewart that ""we've been very careful not to tell anybody it's OK until we have evidence that it is okay."" He said officials advised residents not to use village water or water from an individually-owned well. ""We think it's OK,"" he said. ""But we are not going to know until we test that.""
""Look, there's still cleanup to do,"" he added. ""There's still many things to do, so we're not telling you everything is perfect."" Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine assured residents of East Palestine, Ohio, that state officials and other experts intend to stay in the town until the toxic chemicals from a train derailment earlier this month are cleaned up. ""There's a concern you will be left on your own,"" DeWine said in response to a question about what the future holds for East Palestine, saying some people are anxious that experts will leave when national attention on the issue fades. 
""We're gonna stay in there ... and do what needs to be done,"" he added. The governor said he is making a commitment to those who live there and that officials are going to do ""everything we can so that you have a great future and your children have a great future."" A fiery train wreck that released toxic materials in an Ohio town is raising new questions in the halls of the nation’s capital over the regulation of the rail industry and if stricter measures could have prevented the disaster. News of the derailment in East Palestine, Ohio – and its potentially harmful effects on the environment and health of local residents – has propelled both Democrats and Republicans in Congress to press the Biden administration on whether there’s enough oversight to keep rail workers and communities near railroads safe. And the supervising agency broadly responsible for regulating rail safety, the Department of Transportation, is calling on Congress to make it easier to institute safety reforms. This rare, general bipartisan agreement about taking action in the wake of the derailment follows years of Republicans generally supporting deregulation of the rail industry, including with the broad rollback of transportation rules during the Trump administration. Experts point out several areas of opportunity to enhance rail safety and hold rail companies further accountable: updating trains’ braking systems, shortening the lengths of freight trains, further separating cars with hazardous material, requiring more crew members to be on board and increasing penalties. Many of these proposals, experts say, have been around for decades, and have oftentimes been diminished or entirely eliminated after rail lobbying efforts. Data compiled by the nonprofit OpenSecrets show that Norfolk Southern, the company involved in the Ohio derailment, spent $1.8 million on federal lobbying last year. Bipartisan efforts in Congress: Congressional committees are set to review the environmental and safety impacts of the East Palestine derailment. Although efforts to enhance regulatory oversight of the rail industry have generally broken along party lines, some Republicans and Democrats appear to be moving in the same direction. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chair Sam Graves, a Missouri Republican, scheduled a bipartisan briefing for members of the committee last week. Read more here The CEO of Norfolk Southern, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine are participating in tonight's CNN town hall. For weeks, residents have reported a variety of health problems since the Norfolk Southern train carrying toxic chemicals derailed in early February, spewing black clouds of smoke over the community of about 5,000 people in eastern Ohio. To help prevent a deadly explosion of vinyl chloride, crews released the toxic chemical into a trench and burned it off. Earlier on Wednesday, EPA Administrator Michael Regan threatened expensive consequences if Norfolk Southern fails to fully clean up its toxic train wreck and pay for the fallout in East Palestine. While the EPA says testing shows the air and municipal water are safe, Regan said those with symptoms they believe might be linked to the wreck should “seek medical attention.” Those residents should “ensure that the state and local health agencies understand those experiences because as we force Norfolk Southern to take full accountability for what they’ve done, Norfolk Southern will pay for everything,” Regan said. CNN's Nouran Salahieh, Holly Yan and Claire Colbert contributed reporting to this post. A Senate hearing on the toxic train derailment and cleanup in East Palestine, Ohio, is expected to be held in early March, two Senate sources familiar with the plan told CNN.  In addition to health and safety concerns, the hearing is expected to focus on the timeline of state and federal Environmental Protection Agency response to the incident, one source told CNN. Last week, Sens. Tom Carper of Delaware and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia announced they would hold a hearing on the derailment without setting a date. Carper, a Democrat, is chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee and Capito, a Republican, is a ranking member of the committee.  Carper and Capito said in a statement the hearing would “examine the local, state and federal response in the immediate aftermath of the train derailment and the ongoing efforts to clean up toxic chemicals in the surrounding environment.” Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro alleged Tuesday that Norfolk Southern gave inaccurate information and conflicting data to government officials in regard to the Ohio train derailment that occurred earlier this month. He said he has “serious concerns” with Norfolk Southern’s “failed management of this crisis"" at a Tuesday afternoon news conference in East Palestine, Ohio. “They chose not to participate in the unified command,"" Shapiro said. ""They gave us inaccurate information and conflicting modeling data, and they refused to explore or articulate alternative courses of action when we were dealing with the derailment in the early days.""
“In sum, Norfolk Southern injected unnecessary risk into this crisis,” the Democratic governor added. He said he will hold the company accountable for its actions.  “The combination of Norfolk Southern’s corporate greed, incompetence, and lack of care for our residents is absolutely unacceptable to me,” Shapiro said. When asked what non-financial actions are being taken against the company for the incident, Shapiro said his state’s department of environmental protection has made a “criminal referral” to the attorney general’s office.  Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said his attorney general is reviewing the possible legal action against Norfolk Southern as well on Tuesday.  “The Ohio attorney general will take whatever action that Ohio law allows him to take,” DeWine said after Shapiro spoke. “And I know he’s reviewing this right now.” Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw, who is scheduled to take part in Wednesday's CNN town hall, defended his company’s actions since the disaster caused by the derailment of one of its trains in East Palestine, Ohio, and promised the railroad will pay for the cleanup. “Norfolk Southern is committed to the community and citizens of East Palestine,” Shaw told CNN on Tuesday. “We’re going to be here today, we’re going to be here tomorrow, we’re going to be here a year from now and we’re going to be here five years from now.” Shaw said the company has already paid out $6.5 million to citizens living near the site of the derailment that took place February 3. Shaw said the railroad has been in agreement with the actions of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and local efforts on the ground in East Palestine since the train derailment. Shaw said Norfolk Southern has been coordinating with the Ohio EPA and local officials and, so far, has been very present in the community since the February 3 accident. He said he first came to East Palestine in the immediate aftermath of the accident and visited a family assistance center that the company put in place, where he checked in on residents, making sure they had everything that they needed. “From day one I’ve made the commitment that Norfolk Southern is going to remediate the site,” Shaw said. “We’re going to do it through continuous long-term air and water monitoring. We’re going to help the residents of this community recover and we’re going to invest in the long-term health of this community and we’re going to make Norfolk Southern a safer railroad.” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg will visit the site of the train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, on Thursday. The secretary has come under intense pressure from East Palestine residents and other critics to visit the town in the wake of the February 3 derailment of a Norfolk Southern train that released toxic chemicals. He told reporters earlier this week that he would visit “when the time is right” but was deferring to the National Transportation Safety Board and its investigation first. An administration official told CNN that the time is now appropriate for Buttigieg to go to East Palestine. “The Secretary is going now that the EPA has said it is moving out of the emergency response phase and transitioning to the long-term remediation phase. His visit also coincides with the NTSB issuing its factual findings of the investigation into the cause of the derailment and will allow the secretary to hear from USDOT investigators who were on the ground within hours of the derailment to support the NTSB’s investigation,” the official said. In response to criticism, Buttigieg said in an interview on CBS News’ “Red and Blue"" that he “could have spoken out sooner” about the incident, and that it was a “lesson learned.” He said he has been “respecting the role that the independent NTSB plays and staying out of their way” but does plan to visit East Palestine where he will be “focused on action, not on politics, not on show.” Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine and EPA administrator Michael Regan visited the homes of East Palestine residents on Tuesday to listen to their concerns and conduct air quality tests. The visit comes after municipal water sample results in the city showed ""no water quality concerns,"" according to the EPA.  The officials first visited resident Carolyn Brown's home, where they poured two glasses of water from her tap and took a sip. During the visit, Regan promised transparency, saying that “we will continue to show up.” They then went to the home of East Palestine resident Andris Baltputnis, a former chemistry teacher. Again, they drank water from his tap. “We are in this for the long haul,” the governor told Baltputnis. The resident said assurance and reassurance in the community are good, and he “couldn’t hardly ask for anything more.”  The officials performed an air quality reading at Baltputnis’ home, showing the reading for the toxins in the air as zero. CNN answers six key questions on the derailment of the train carrying hazardous material earlier in February: Why are hazardous materials transported by train? This is in large part because railroads are considered the safest mode of transportation to carry large amounts of hazardous materials, including chemicals, for long distances across the country, according to the Federal Railroad Administration. America’s freight trains moved 2.2 million carloads of chemicals in 2021, according to the Association of American Railroads. How often does this kind of incident happen? Federal Rail Administration data provided to CNN showed 149 incidents where hazardous materials were released from moving trains over the past decade. It’s important to note the federal data is being self-reported by train companies, making it tough to verify all the information is accurate. How do officials measure the damage and impact? Ohio Environmental Protection Agency officials have been conducting air, soil and water tests since the controlled explosion of the chemicals inside the rail cars. The EPA said Tuesday there were chemicals spilled into the local waterways that lead to the Ohio River, but that much of it was contained. An initial plume of chemicals that was spilled into the waterway had made it to the Ohio River, but officials said they exist in very low concentration, and they are working with water facilities on enhanced filtration so they are not passed onto water customers. That said, EPA and Ohio state officials urged residents in East Palestine to continue to drink bottled water for now. If animals are dying, what does that mean for humans? The chemical spill took a severe toll on local aquatic life: About 3,500 fish ranging across 12 species died from the water contamination washing down streams and rivers. Anecdotal reports of pets and chickens dying have not yet been confirmed by officials. Mary Mertz, the director of Ohio’s Department of Natural Resources, said Tuesday there’s no evidence that non-aquatic species have been affected by the spill. What goes into cleaning up? Ohio EPA and state officials have done several different things to try to contain pollution from the chemical spill.  Crews have put oil containment booms in waterways and aerated contaminated soil and water.
Crews have excavated and removed nearly 500 cubic yards of “vinyl chloride-impacted material” including soil, according to Kurt Kollar, the on-scene coordinator for the Ohio EPA’s Office of Emergency Response. 
The EPA is blocking off ditches around the contaminated dirt so that it doesn’t contaminate more water.
The EPA also said it has collected and stored nearly one million gallons of water in containers. 
Officials said water treatment facilities should be able to remove the remaining low levels of volatile organic compounds in the water, and that the water will eventually be safe to drink. What are the possible long-term impacts? In addition to the chemicals officials say should break down with aeration and water treatment, environmental officials also need to test for PFAS – a long-lasting and potentially more worrying class of chemicals used to put out chemical fires. PFAS is typically found on non-stick pans and in some firefighting foams.  Read more details here. Top officials from the state of Ohio, Norfolk Southern and the Environmental Protection Agency will take part in CNN's town hall Wednesday night.   Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, EPA Administrator Michael Regan and Alan Shaw, the CEO of Norfolk Southern, are all set to take part in the town hall, which airs at 9 p.m. ET and will be moderated by Jake Tapper.  Additionally, several local and state officials, including Anne Vogel, director of the Ohio EPA and Dr. Bruce Vanderhoff, the director of the Ohio Department of Health.  This post has been updated with the latest details on those who will take part in the town hall. A Norfolk Southern train with more than 100 cars derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, on February 3, sparking a massive fire and prompting evacuation orders.  There were 20 cars with hazardous material in the train – 10 of which derailed. Five of the tankers were carrying liquid vinyl chloride, which is extremely combustible.  The wreckage burned for days in the town, which is located about 15 miles south of Youngstown, as authorities worried about the possibility of a widespread, deadly explosion. But crews managed controlled detonations to release the chemical, which can kill quickly at high levels and increase cancer risk. The hazardous substance spilled into a trench, where it was burned away. Officials issued a shelter-in-place order for the entire town of roughly 5,000 people, while the evacuation order was in effect for days for those within a mile of the train incident.  Authorities have since assured residents that any immediate danger has passed as they lifted the evacuation order for those living in East Palestine. Real-time air readings, which use handheld instruments to broadly screen for classes of contaminants like volatile organic compounds, showed the air quality near the site was within normal limits. Still, people who live in East Palestine want to know about the chemical threats that may linger. Some residents have reported health problems, and about 3,500 fish have died in Ohio waterways since the wreck.  Officials are investigating the incident's cause as site cleanup and monitoring could take years, according to the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. A source familiar with the investigation tells CNN the NTSB will issue its initial findings on Thursday. Approximately 15 cars remain at the derailment site, where they are on an NTSB hold, according to Connor Spielmaker, a spokesperson for Norfolk Southern.  Ohio officials say the soil under the tracks is still contaminated and that the tracks will eventually be lifted to remove that soil. The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency is aware of the contaminated soil, and according to Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, 4,588 cubic yards of soil and 1.1 million gallons of contaminated water have been removed thus far.  Roughly 21 miles before it derailed, a Norfolk Southern train slowed down dramatically after showing the first signs of potential wheel bearing overheat, according to a CNN analysis of surveillance video and documents from the Department of Transportation. The train had been traveling at an average speed of 49 mph between Alliance, Ohio and Salem, Ohio. It took 16 minutes for the train to travel 13 miles. In Alliance, surveillance video did not show any signs of overheat. However, in Salem, surveillance video showed bright lights and sparks emanating from the train's wheelset — the signs of a potential wheel bearing overheat. Between Salem and East Palestine, the train slowed dramatically, averaging a speed of just 29 mph until it derailed. It took 44 minutes for the train to travel about 21 miles. Documents filed in 2020 with the Federal Railroad Authority give context to the abnormality of that slowdown. The ""typical speed range"" for a train traveling along this stretch of track is between 40 and 60 miles per hour. The revelation that the train's average speed decreased by around 20 mph in the roughly 40 minutes before it derailed draws more questions about whether the train's crew was alerted to any potential issues — like a wheel-bearing overheat. Norfolk Southern, like all railroad companies, utilizes hot box detectors to alert train crews and dispatchers of overheat issues. An online database of hot box detectors radio recordings, compiled and maintained by radio and rail enthusiasts, indicates Norfolk Southern has a hot box detector in Salem, just past where surveillance video captured the train's apparent wheel bearing overheat. The company also has two other hot box detectors on the line, one in Colombiana, Ohio, and in East Palestine. CNN was able to calculate the average speed of the train by utilizing surveillance video time stamps that showed the train's positions at specific points on the track. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said it is investigating surveillance video that may show ""what appears to be a wheel bearing in the final stage of overheat failure moments before the derailment."" Jennifer Gabris, a NTSB spokesperson, told CNN that ""this information will be part of the preliminary report that will be released [Thursday] at 10 a.m."" Michael Regan, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, said Tuesday the agency will support East Palestine as it enters a cleanup phase, and will continue to hold Norfolk Southern accountable for its actions. “But let me also be crystal clear – Norfolk Southern will pay for cleaning up the mess that they created and the trauma that they inflicted on this community and impacted Beaver County residents,” Regan said at a news conference. Using EPA’s legal authorities, Regan said he ordered Norfolk Southern to clean up all contaminated soil and water and safely transport that contamination to the appropriate locations.  That work will be done to EPA specifications, Regan added, and said Norfolk Southern will reimburse EPA for cleaning services. He said he is also ordering Norfolk Southern to attend and participate in public meetings and share information with the public. If Norfolk Southern fails to complete any action ordered by the EPA, the agency will conduct the work itself and then force Norfolk Southern to pay triple in cost, Regan said. “In no way, shape or form will Norfolk Southern get off the hook for the mess that they created,” Regan said. Regan added he has “absolute confidence” in the agency’s air and water quality testing data. “Our data is very solid,” Regan said. “And we believe that in our partnership with the state, that we have absolute confidence. And if the homes have been cleared and tested for drinking water, then we trust that data. We feel really good about that.” State and federal officials held a news conference last week in East Palestine, Ohio, as residents expressed frustration about the response to a train carrying potentially deadly materials that derailed in their hometown nearly three weeks ago. Michael S. Regan, the head of the US Environmental Protection Agency, aimed to reassure residents that authorities are focused on keeping them safe. Regan arrived in East Palestine on February 16 to assess the ongoing response. “This incident has understandably shaken this community to its core,"" Regan said. ""The community has questions and they deserve answers. I want the community to know that we hear you, we see you, and that we will get to the bottom of this."" The evacuation order issued after a days-long blaze was lifted on February 8 after air and water samples led officials to deem the area safe. “EPA has assisted with the screening of more than 480 homes under the voluntary screening program offered to residents. And no detections of vinyl chloride or hydrogen chloride were identified. And we’re continuing to make those screenings available to any resident that wants to have their indoor air tested,"" Regan said.  The agency has full authority to use its enforcement capabilities over the crisis and it will stay there ""as long as it takes"" to ensure the community's safety, he added.

"Exclusive: North Korea a 'clear and present danger,' says South Korean Foreign Minister",2023-02-22,"North Korea is a ""clear and present danger,"" the foreign minister of South Korea has told CNN in an exclusive interview. Kim Jong Un's frequent missile tests and repeated warnings that he would consider using tactical nuclear weapons were a display of aggression and the only way to counter this was through extended US deterrence, Foreign Minister Park Jin said on Wednesday. ""What North Korea is doing is completely wrong,"" Park said. ""They have been escalating nuclear and missile threats, and threatening the peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia."" In just the past week, North Korea has tested an intercontinental ballistic missile, which in theory could be used to strike almost anywhere in the world, and nuclear-capable long-range multiple rocket launchers -- the equivalent of short-range ballistic missiles -- which could hit anywhere in South Korea. Those followed a record year of missile testing in 2022, when Pyongyang tested missiles on 37 days, according to CNN's count, all in violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions. After the rocket launches on Monday, Kim Yo Jong, Kim Jong Un's sister, warned of more missile tests to come unless the United States halts military drills with South Korea, threatening to make the Pacific Ocean ""our shooting range."" But Park suggested such belligerence would only strengthen South Korea's alliance with the US. ""US extended deterrence"" is ""the only way that we can effectively protect our country from the North Korean aggression,"" Park said, adding that enhancing that deterrence would involve ""effective deployment of US strategic assets"" as well as exercises and training. On the same day as Park was speaking, guided-missile destroyers from both countries were joined by another from Japan in a ballistic missile defense exercise in the waters between Japan and the Korean Peninsula. Park offered little hope for any early easing of tensions with North Korea, saying there are no active negotiations and that Kim would not give up his nuclear weapons voluntarily. The North Korean leader must be made to see that talks are his only option, Park said. ""We have to create an environment where North Korea has no choice but to come back to the negotiation table,"" he said. Experience had shown that Kim would not negotiate when he sensed weakness in his opponents, Park said, citing failed negotiations that occurred during the administration of former US President Donald Trump. ""The lesson we learned is that when we are strong ... North Korea comes to the dialogue table. When we are weak, they try to take advantage of that vulnerability. So we have to prepare ourselves through our defense and also through deterrence to talk with the North,"" he said. Park also said South Korea's security challenges extend beyond the Korean Peninsula, including a thousand miles to the south across the Taiwan Strait. ""Peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait is essential for peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, and it's indispensable for security and prosperity of the region as a whole,"" Park said. China's ruling Communist Party has for months been pressuring the self-ruled island of Taiwan. It sees the island as part of its territory, despite never having controlled it, and Chinese leader Xi Jinping has repeatedly refused to rule out the use of force in ""reunifying"" it with the Chinese mainland. Park said that could have a ""direct impact"" on South Korea. ""We are opposed to unilateral change of (the) status quo by force. So in that sense, we will make sure that if something happens in the Taiwan Strait, we have to maintain peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula."" he said.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.709, 'pos': 0.291, 'compound': 0.4767}",25,78.0,0.174,0.826,0.0,-0.7269,0.079,0.8,0.121,0.9814,-18.1725,195.3401,383.0,0.5100263707571802
"Ohio's toxic spill is unleashing poisonous, partisan politics",2023-02-23,"The people of East Palestine, Ohio, just want help, truth and accountability after a freight train wreck smothered their town with a toxic cloud and left them afraid to drink the water. ""I don't feel safe, because I don't know what the future holds for my town,"" said lifelong East Palestine resident Jessica Conard during a Wednesday evening CNN town hall. Her comment encapsulated a remarkable and pervasive feeling of mistrust among residents toward assurances by state and federal officials that their air and water are safe. ""This has the potential to really decimate a small town like us,"" Conard added. A massive clean-up is underway, officials are testing local water systems, wells, streams and creeks, and multiple investigations are beginning. But these Ohioans in the epicenter of an environmental crisis, which suddenly arrived on their doorsteps on February 3, are also becoming political extras on an early stage for GOP White House candidates like former President Donald Trump. Whenever disaster strikes in divided America, toxic politics isn't far behind, and derailments -- like hurricanes, industrial accidents and transportation meltdowns -- come with a political scorecard that adversaries leverage to try to damage those in power. Republicans are using the derailment to claim that while President Joe Biden is lavishing billions on Ukrainians he visited in a daring trip to wartime Kyiv this week, he is neglecting needy Americans back home. ""You are not forgotten,"" Trump said after traveling to East Palestine on Wednesday -- although lacking the power of his former office, he has more capacity to boost his slow-moving 2024 campaign than to fix the disaster. The train wreck is also a fresh hazard for a Democratic rising star, Pete Buttigieg. The former presidential Democratic candidate's role as Transportation secretary offers a valuable platform ahead of possible future campaigns. But it also carries the risk of a political blow every time something goes wrong with America's accident-prone infrastructure. Buttigieg, who is headed to Ohio Thursday, admits he could have spoken out about East Palestine sooner and has promised to learn his lesson. He'll now travel there the same day a preliminary National Transportation Safety Board report into the causes of the derailment is set to be released.  Republicans sense vulnerability. ""He is an incompetent who is focused solely on his fantasies about his political future & needs to be fired,"" tweeted Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who, like Buttigieg, might also have another White House race in his future. The Ohio disaster is also allowing the public a glimpse into the rarely seen Washington duel between regulators and freight firms, which has huge implications for keeping Americans safe as vast trains -- some as long as 150 cars, some carrying poisonous chemicals -- rumble through towns and cities. Trump might be posing as a savior now, but he presided over a slashing of environmental and safety regulations in office. Huge transportation firms, meanwhile, pay lobbyists millions of dollars to loosen safety rules and staffing levels as they seek to maximize profits, even while rewarding shareholders and scrimping on safety. Still, perhaps the consequences of the derailment could unlock unusual coalitions in Washington. Conservative Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and progressive Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota are both demanding reforms, for instance. But in Washington, expectations of bipartisan action after a catastrophe often wane as time passes. Mistrust in local, state and federal leaders is rampant  Given the political hypocrisy on show, the sometimes slow-moving machinery of a government disaster response, and the complex layers of federal, state and local responsibility, it's no wonder residents question whether they are being heard.  Their concerns are only exacerbated by the fact that hazardous smoke that rose over their homes followed a controlled burn of several wagons containing chemicals, which was ordered by officials to forestall an even worse disaster -- a massive explosion. Residents of the town of 5,000 people complained of medical conditions like rashes, sore throats, bloody noses and other ailments and found thousands of dead fish in creeks. Locals want quicker action from state and federal leaders, question officials' assurances their water was safe and feel overpowered by Norfolk Southern, the multi-billion dollar railroad firm that was responsible for the train that derailed.  A response that some saw as sluggish has ramped up. The Biden administration is now forcing Norfolk Southern to pay for the clean-up operation and to compensate the government for its expenses. Yet many townspeople mistrust officials who tell them they are in no danger, contrasting the evidence of their own senses with what they are being told.  Trump leaps at a political opening  One person's plea for help is another's political opening. Trump may have brought some comfort to people in a region that voted for him overwhelmingly with his visit on Wednesday, but it was still a partisan political play. ""I sincerely hope that when your representatives and all of the politicians get here, including Biden, they get back from touring Ukraine, that he's got some money left over,"" Trump said in East Palestine, in Columbiana County, which he won with 72% of the vote over the current president in the 2020 election. ""We stayed with you, we pray for you and we will stay with you,"" Trump said, despite having no capacity to direct the government response. His attack on Biden did, however, underscore his ""America First"" mantra. In response, Biden tweeted about the disaster while in Europe, blaming his predecessor's administration for making it harder to implement rail safety measures and telling residents, ""We've got your back."" Trump pledged bottled water sourced from his hotels and bought burgers for firefighters in a local McDonald's as he adopted the trappings of a presidential post-disaster visit to polish his own political profile. He boasted how he had deployed the Federal Emergency Management Agency -- which is currently operating in East Palestine -- during his presidency. He didn't mention his own criticized disaster mismanagement, however, after Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico in 2017 or during the Covid-19 pandemic. Trump sidestepped a question over his role in weakening safety standards after he repealed an Obama administration rule requiring freight railroads to employ electronically controlled pneumatic brakes on certain trains hauling hazardous and flammable cargos. The measure wouldn't have stopped the East Palestine disaster since the train that derailed there didn't have sufficient cars of such a type that would have triggered the rule had it still been in force. But critics have charged that Trump's slashing of such rules and his elimination of regulations across the board made railroads and Americans less safe. Other current and potential Republican presidential candidates rushed to catch up with Trump. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley asked whether Biden shouldn't be ""with those people in Ohio."" Haley's attack seemed inconsistent with her vow to be tougher than Biden on Russian President Vladimir Putin. After all, the president traveled to Europe around the anniversary of the Russian invasion to warn Putin would never win the war. And former Vice President Mike Pence, who might also run in 2024, said he was ""glad"" that Biden went to Ukraine ""but he should have gone to East Palestine first.""  Buttigieg navigates another tough political spot  Given his political profile, Buttigieg is one of the most famous Transportation secretaries in modern history. He's been thrust into the spotlight during travel meltdowns in the aviation industry -- during weather-related shutdowns and during the chaos triggered by Southwest's scheduling nightmare last year. Republicans blame the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor for every transportation mess. In response, he has positioned himself as the champion of the victims. In the case of the Ohio train wreck, for example, he wrote this week to Alan Shaw, the head of Norfolk Southern, bemoaning the way the derailment had ""upended the lives of numerous residents.""  ""The people of East Palestine cannot be forgotten, nor can they be simply considered the cost of doing business,"" Buttigieg wrote in the letter, which was clearly designed for an audience wider than Shaw. Buttigieg also admitted Wednesday that he ""could have spoken out sooner"" regarding the derailment. ""I was focused on just making sure that our folks on the ground were all set but could have spoken sooner about how strongly I felt about this incident and that's a lesson learned for me,"" Buttigieg said on CBS News' ""Red & Blue."" Buttigieg said he had been ""respecting the role that the independent NTSB plays and staying out of their way"" but vowed to be ""focused on action, not on politics, not on show"" when he visits East Palestine.  Now that Biden is back on US soil, the odds of him making his own visit -- to empathize with townspeople and to show he's on top of the response -- must be rising. Such trips are often about perception. But the presence of a commander in chief does galvanize the government like nothing else and assure those hit by disasters that they are not forgotten. One thing is certain, however: if he does go, Trump will claim credit.","{'neg': 0.346, 'neu': 0.654, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.5719}",60,79.0,0.056999999999999995,0.8190000000000001,0.12383333333333334,0.22235999999999997,0.134,0.766,0.1,-0.9973,13.341599999999998,207.6584,407.0,0.510217199017199
House January 6 investigator says it's 'likely' 2020 election subversion probes will produce indictments,2023-02-23,"The top investigator on the House committee that probed the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack said Wednesday it is ""likely"" that the Georgia and federal investigations into efforts to subvert the 2020 presidential election will produce indictments.  Timothy Heaphy told CNN's Kate Bolduan on ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" that ""unless there is information inconsistent, which I don't expect, I think there will likely be indictments both in Georgia and at the federal level."" In Georgia, the foreperson of the Atlanta-based grand jury that investigated former President Donald Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 election told CNN on Tuesday that the panel is recommending multiple indictments and suggested ""the big name"" may be on the list. The grand jury met for about seven months in Atlanta and heard testimony from 75 witnesses, including some of Trump's closest advisers from his final weeks in the White House. Now that the grand jury is finished, it's up to Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis to review the recommendations and make charging decisions. Willis' decisions in this case will reverberate in the 2024 presidential campaign and beyond. Trump, who has launched his 2024 campaign for the White House, denies any criminal wrongdoing.  At the federal level, special counsel Jack Smith is overseeing parts of the criminal investigation into the Capitol attack and has subpoenaed members of Trump's inner circle. On Wednesday, the New York Times reported that Smith had subpoenaed the former president's daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner for testimony.  ""I think it could be very important,"" Heaphy said of the pair's potential testimony. ""They were present for really significant events. The special counsel will want to hear about the president's understanding of the election results and also what happened on January 6. And they both had direct communications with him about the events preceding the riot at the Capitol,"" he said. The special counsel has a massive amount of evidence already in-hand that it now needs to comb through, including evidence recently turned over by the House January 6 committee, subpoena documents provided by local officials in key states and discovery collected from lawyers for Trump allies late last year in a flurry of activity, at least some of which had not been reviewed as of early January, sources familiar with the investigation told CNN at the time. ""He will not stop because of a family relationship, because of purported executive privilege,"" Heaphy said of Smith. ""He believes that the law entitles him to all of that information, and he's determined to get it."" Ivanka Trump and Kushner previously testified to the House select committee, which expired in January after Republicans took control of the House. The panel had referred the former president to the Justice Department on four criminal charges in December, and while largely symbolic in nature, committee members stressed those referrals served as a way to document their views given that Congress cannot bring charges. This story has been updated with additional information Wednesday.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",18,80.0,0.073,0.8762857142857143,0.05071428571428571,0.008560000000000002,0.056,0.884,0.06,-0.2309,0.15408000000000002,207.81248000000002,410.0,0.5068597073170732
Proud Boy testifies in sedition trial about far-right group being the 'tip of the spear' on January 6,2023-02-23,"The sole Proud Boy to plead guilty to seditious conspiracy in connection to the US Capitol riot testified on Wednesday that members of the far-right organization believed the country was barreling toward revolution and that they were the ""tip of the spear.""   Jeremy Bertino, a top lieutenant to Proud Boys Chairman Enrique Tarrio, testified as part of a cooperation deal that he struck with prosecutors against Tarrio and four other members of the Proud Boys charged with conspiring to stop the certification of the 2020 presidential election.  ""We had a big fight on our hands. It was going to be an uphill battle, and everyone had turned against us,"" Bertino testified. ""My belief was that we had to take the reins and pretty much be the leaders that we had been building ourselves up to be.""  His testimony allowed prosecutors to show jurors how the events of January 6, 2021, unfolded in the mind of a top member of the organization as he watched it online from his North Carolina home, sending messages to his ""brothers"" about targeting then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and assuring them that members of the far-left group Antifa weren't there to stop them.  Some of the messages featured in court were from defendants in the case, whom Bertino said he would ""take a bullet for."" But Bertino and the five defendants -- Tarrio, Ethan Nordean, Zachary Rehl, Joseph Biggs and Dominic Pezzola -- rarely made eye contact during the testimony.    There was not a premeditated or specific plan to storm the Capitol, Bertino testified, adding that getting the Proud Boys to communicate and work together was like ""herding cats."" The Proud Boys had several group messages from the days before the riot where members mentioned descending on the Capitol building, according to exhibits shown by prosecutors.  'Foot soldiers of the right'  As court challenges to the 2020 election failed, members of the Proud Boys -- who saw themselves as the ""foot soldiers of the right"" -- began to believe the country was headed toward an ""all-out revolution,"" Bertino testified.    ""I felt it coming,"" he said.   The Proud Boys believed that the government was controlled by ""commies,"" he testified, and they began to turn against the police, whom the group increasingly saw as their enemy. Everybody in the organization felt ""desperate,"" including Tarrio, Bertino told the jury.   ""His tones were calculated,"" Bertino said of Tarrio. ""Cold, but very determined. He felt the exact same way that I did.""   Members also were inspired by then-President Donald Trump's reference to their organization in a 2020 presidential debate, where he told the group to ""stand back and stand by."" Bertino testified that there were ""nonstop requests for membership"" after the debate, specifically from people who wanted to attend rallies, and that the group did less vetting of new members to keep up with applications.     During cross examination, Bertino said that he thought the Proud Boys had a goal to stop the 2020 election but had no knowledge of how that goal would be achieved.  ""I didn't have a direct idea of where they were going, how they were going to get there."" Bertino was not in Washington, DC, on the day of the riot because he was at home recovering from a stab wound he suffered during a previous pro-Trump rally, but he testified that he watched on a livestream video. He saw the mob as starting the ""next American revolution,"" and told others Proud Boys he was brought to tears during the attack.   ""I was happy, excited, in awe and disbelief that people were doing what they said they would do,"" Bertino told the jury. When the crowd descended on the Capitol building, ""it meant that we influenced people, the normies, enough to make them stand for themselves and take back their country and take back their freedom,"" he said.    In chats to other Proud Boys, Bertino encouraged members to move forward, telling them that he could see the Capitol building on a livestream and that no members of Antifa would be at the building to stop the pro-Trump mob.   Bertino also messaged: ""They need to get peloton"" -- which he testified was a misspelled reference to Pelosi. ""She was the talking head of the opposition and they needed to remove her from power,"" he said. By the evening of January 6, Bertino grew angry at Trump supporters for leaving the Capitol building, he told the jury.   ""The way I felt at the moment, if we give that building up, we were giving up our country,"" Bertino testified. He sent encrypted messages to other Proud Boys members, saying that ""we failed,"" and ""Half measures mean nothing,"" and, referring to lawmakers inside the Capitol, ""Fuck fear: They need to be hung.""  ""Once they took that step, there was no coming back from it,"" Bertino testified Wednesday. ""And they decided basically to balk and walk away after creating all that chaos down there.""    ""The revolution had failed,"" he continued, ""because the House was still going to go on and certify the election.""   Bertino told the jury that after January 6, he tried to delete what he saw as incriminating messages on his phone and he wasn't fully truthful with FBI agents when they asked him about the Capitol attack.    ""I guess it's a natural instinct to protect yourself and protect those you love,"" Bertino testified.    ""I love them,"" he said of the five defendants. ""I didn't want to see anything bad happen to them. Still don't.""

Opinion: Trump's visit to Ohio derailment scene poses risk for Biden,2023-02-23,"On Wednesday, former President Donald Trump headed to East Palestine, Ohio, in an apparent attempt to gain a political edge over President Joe Biden, whose administration he criticized for being more preoccupied with international affairs than with domestic issues like the toxic train derailment earlier this month.  As Biden concludes a successful trip to Europe, where he paid a surprise visit to Ukraine and reaffirmed America's commitment to stopping Russian aggression, the residents of East Palestine are still struggling with the fallout from the Norfolk Southern train derailment, which contaminated thousands of cubic yards of soil and more than 1.1 million gallons of water.  The train, which was carrying hazardous chemicals including vinyl chloride and butyl acrylate, set off a massive fire that lasted for several days. Residents in both Ohio and Pennsylvania were told to evacuate as authorities carried out a controlled release of toxic materials, which were diverted to a trench and burned off.  Many in East Palestine are understandably concerned about the effects these chemicals might have on their health. Even though federal air monitoring and water sample tests have indicated conditions are safe, residents have reported a number of ailments and thousands of fish have died in nearby creeks.  Trump, who donated water and cleaning supplies on Wednesday, has been critical of the federal response, saying earlier this week, ""You have a president going to Ukraine and you have people in Ohio that are in desperate need of help."" On Wednesday, he said he hoped Biden has ""some money left over"" after he returns from Ukraine.  He isn't the only one -- Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also criticized Biden for ""neglecting"" a ""lot of problems accumulating here in our own country,"" while Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley made similar comments, asking, ""Shouldn't he be with those people in Ohio?""  Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg admitted on CBS News that he ""could have spoken sooner about how strongly I felt about this incident, and that's a lesson learned for me."" Facing mounting criticism, Buttigieg is now planning to visit East Palestine on Thursday.  Despite this criticism, Democrats have been quick to point to the supposed hypocrisy of the Republican attacks, criticizing Trump for rolling back federal regulations on train safety, including one that would have imposed braking requirements for trains carrying certain hazardous material. (Given the ongoing National Transportation Safety Board investigation into the cause of the accident, it's unclear whether any of those regulations could have prevented the accident. The specific regulation regarding braking would not have applied to the train in Ohio because it was not classified as a high-hazard flammable train.)  But the Biden administration needs to follow through and make sure that the government is providing the necessary support for people in East Palestine. Already, the Environmental Protection Agency has stepped in, saying that it will force Norfolk Southern to clean up the contaminated soil and water, reimburse the EPA for cleaning services, and more. It has also sent federal medical experts to the town to ""assess the public health needs"" at the site.    But the president needs to reassure the residents of East Palestine and make sure that the town has all the resources it needs for a comprehensive cleanup while calling for the establishment of safety regulations that can diminish the chances of this kind of accident from happening again. While the Biden administration has tried more recently to emphasize the steps it has taken to address the accident, the president could pay a high political cost for appearing to ignore the domestic front in favor of the international realm.  One can look back at President George H.W. Bush, whose skyrocketing poll numbers after the US successfully forced Iraqi troops out of Kuwait without triggering a ground war was seen as a ticket to reelection. Within months, those hopes evaporated as Democrats criticized the administration for ignoring the economic recession gripping the nation. They pounced on the president, claiming he was out of touch with average Americans and that his administration was slow to respond to the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew in Florida.  The famous mantra of the Clinton team, ""It's the economy, stupid,"" was meant to be a constant reminder to everyone on the campaign to keep highlighting the difference between a Democratic candidate whose focus was on the bread-and-butter concerns of Americans and a president whose primary interest was foreign policy.   The political finger pointing that has broken out after the train derailment comes at a time when people who live outside major cities harbor negative opinions about both parties, according to a report released by the nonprofit American Families Voices. According to a Washington Post-ABC News poll, 6 out of 10 Americans don't feel that Biden has done much.  The good news for Democrats is that Biden is not George H.W. Bush. ""Scranton Joe"" is a politician who has always sought to connect with middle and working class voters. During the Obama presidency, Biden was tasked with making policy recommendations to tackle the challenges facing the middle class. And his administration has pushed a robust domestic agenda that has poured billions into local communities and bolstered family budgets. If Republicans want to really take him on with this issue, the president will have plenty to point to — from the Child Tax Credit to infrastructure projects.   It is not just Biden, either. From the New Deal to the Great Society to President Obama's domestic agenda, Democrats have spent much of the 20th and 21st century championing federal programs to help achieve economic security. Biden also recently pushed his vision of economic populism in his State of the Union address.   Moreover, while inflation continues to be a serious problem for Americans, job growth is booming and the economy has bounced back from the devastating effects of the pandemic, with the American Rescue Plan having played a big role in that effort.   In other words, Biden has plenty to work with to dispute the kind of claims being leveled by a Republican Party that has focused much more on supply side tax cuts, deregulation, and culture wars than on addressing the kind of crucial issues to emerge through the situation in East Palestine.   But former President Bush, who lost in 1992 after serving just one term, still has a lesson to offer. Biden can't take his or his party's record for granted, and if he runs for reelection, he must outline what more his party would be doing to address the kinds of structural challenges so many American communities face.  If Biden is indeed seeking reelection, he must make clear that he would be the candidate fighting hardest to make sure that America's working and middle class families will be better off than when his presidency started.

Trump visits Ohio train derailment site in effort to highlight Biden's absence,2023-02-22,"Former President Donald Trump on Wednesday visited the site of a train derailment, criticizing President Joe Biden's administration's handling of the railway disaster that spewed toxic chemicals in East Palestine, Ohio, 19 days earlier.  His trip to one of the most conservative regions of the deep-red state came with many of the hallmarks of a presidential visit, as Trump sought to contrast himself with Biden -- who on Monday made a historic war zone trip to Ukraine's capital.  As he visited Little Beaver Creek, an Ohio River tributary near the derailment site, Trump said he thinks it is ""terrible"" that Biden has not yet visited the site of the February 3 derailment.  ""You are not forgotten,"" Trump said as he stood alongside a small group of local officials, including Republican Sen. J.D. Vance, and first responders after a briefing at a fire station.  The former president's Ohio trip came as the 2024 GOP presidential race begins to take shape, with intra-party rivals lining up to take on Trump. Other Republicans have also criticized Biden's response to the derailment near the Ohio-Pennsylvania border.  ""During any time of crisis, go to your people immediately,"" former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley said Tuesday at a campaign stop in Iowa. Amid the increasingly pitched battle between Democrats and Republicans over whether the government has done enough to help the Ohio town, Trump sought to take credit for the escalating federal response, saying Wednesday that the announcement of his visit ""opened up the dam.""  He said the Federal Emergency Management Agency's announcement last week that it was deploying teams to the area should have come ""two weeks earlier, or at least a week earlier.""  Trump also said he had helped coordinate the delivery of thousands of water bottles to the area -- some with ""Trump"" logos on them, coming from the former president's hotel properties. He said some of the water had come on the plane he had flown from Florida on Wednesday.  ""If they don't come back and give you the treatment that you need, we will come back,"" Trump said.  The derailment of the Norfolk Southern train carrying toxic chemicals has become a political flashpoint -- and Trump's decision to travel to East Palestine has also focused new attention on his own administration's policies that encouraged the deregulation of the rail industry.  Trump ended a 2015 Obama-era regulation mandating for trains carrying ""large volumes of flammable liquids"" like crude oil to have advanced brakes and speed restrictions -- put in place after a number of deadly derailments. ""A lot of the folks who seem to find political opportunity there are among those who have sided with the rail industry again and again and again, as they have fought safety regulations on railroads and hazmat, tooth and nail,"" said Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who announced Wednesday he will visit the site of the derailment Thursday. ""If people are going to find religion about rail regulation, sometimes for the first time, I welcome that."" Experts told CNN that the regulations likely would not have impacted the derailment in East Palestine because the train did not meet the criteria laid out by the Obama administration-era regulation.  Republicans have largely ignored this argument, and instead bashed the slow response from the federal government, with some conservative commentators insinuating the pace was because residents in East Palestine are GOP voters.  Some have also contrasted Biden's visit to Ukraine, where he traveled to Kyiv by train, with his absence in Ohio.  ""That was the biggest slap in the face that tells you right now he doesn't care about us,"" East Palestine Mayor Trent Conaway, a Republican, said of Biden's trip to Ukraine earlier this week on Fox News. ""I found that out this morning in one of the briefings that he was in the Ukraine giving millions of dollars away to people over there and not to us and I'm furious.""  Trump's team coordinated the former President's trip with a number of officials on the ground, including Conway. Trump and his advisers have sought to take credit for the federal response seen in recent days. ""Since Trump announced the trip, the EPA administrator changed his schedule and went [to East Palestine], all the sudden FEMA changes course and provides federal help -- enough things have happened that we've already accomplished a lot of what we had hoped before even being on the ground,"" one Trump adviser told CNN.

East Palestine derailment spurs rare signs of bipartisan agreement on rail safety. Will Washington act?,2023-02-22,"A fiery train wreck that released toxic materials in an Ohio town is raising new questions in the halls of the nation's capital over the regulation of the rail industry and if stricter measures could have prevented the disaster. News of the East Palestine, Ohio, derailment -- and its potential harmful effects on the environment and health of local residents -- has propelled both Democrats and Republicans in Congress to press the Biden administration on whether there's enough oversight to keep rail workers and communities near railroads safe. And the supervising agency broadly responsible for regulating rail safety, the Department of Transportation, is calling on Congress to make it easier to institute safety reforms.  This rare, general bipartisan agreement about taking action in the wake of the derailment follows years of Republicans generally supporting deregulation of the rail industry, including with the broad rollback of transportation rules during the Trump administration.  Unions, current and former regulatory officials, and members of Congress from both parties have signaled some optimism about the possibility that the Ohio disaster may mark a rare opportunity for Washington to get something done to enhance the rail industry's safety standards. But what's unclear is whether there's enough momentum for both parties in Congress to propel the issue forward into tangible actions. Nor is it clear whether the rail industry's strong lobbying efforts will pare down any proposed measures or play a hand in eliminating them altogether. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in an interview with CNN on Tuesday that that he's fed up with the rail industry's pressure campaigns to diminish regulatory reforms.  ""I've had it,"" he said. ""We have had situation after situation where even modest, reasonable reform gets just a full court press."" ""I do think if the railroads, like Norfolk Southern, are in a mode right now where they're saying, 'We're going to do everything it takes and everything we can.' Let's give them a chance to show it,"" Buttigieg later added. ""But let's be very clear, I'm not waiting for them to do this work. I'm just saying they have a chance to put their money where their mouth is."" Experts point out several areas of opportunity to enhance rail safety and hold rail companies further accountable: updating trains' braking system, shortening the lengths of freight trains, further separating cars with hazardous material, requiring more crew member be on board, and increasing penalties.  Many of these proposals, experts say, have been around for decades, and have oftentimes been diminished or entirely eliminated after rail lobbying efforts. Data compiled by the nonprofit OpenSecrets show that Norfolk Southern spent $1.8 million on federal lobbying last year.  Norfolk Southern posted record profits from railway operations of $4.8 billion in 2022, up from its previous record of $4.45 billion in 2021. The company did not respond to questions Wednesday on whether it expects to change its share repurchase plans in the wake of the derailment. ""Unfortunately, derailments like this are preventable and they become inevitable when there's more risk in the system,"" Sarah Feinberg, a former administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration during the Obama administration, told CNN. ""The industry has fought tooth and nail against safety regulations, but I also think that's typical of any industry."" Rail industry's 'stranglehold on Congress' Lobbying influence from the rail industry is ""a big problem and they have a stranglehold on Congress, especially in the Senate,"" Greg Hynes, national legislative director for the SMART Transportation Division union, told CNN.  ""It's all about the bottom line and they adhere to the operating ratios that Wall Street is so hungry for, which includes lowering head counts -- which includes fewer safety inspections, fewer brake tests, fewer people doing the job that they need to do,"" he added.  Buttigieg recently sent a letter Sunday to Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw demanding accountability and calling for greater safety regulations. And DOT subsequently announced on Tuesday that it would take a three-pronged approach to enhance rail safety -- push companies to voluntarily adopt additional safety measures, call on Congress to do more and bolster administration efforts to regulate the industry.  Among other plans to advance existing efforts or deploy existing funding, DOT says it's initiating focused safety inspections as well as pursuing additional federal rulemaking on high-hazard flammable trains and electronically controlled pneumatic brakes.  DOT also says it's working to advance a proposed rule that would require a minimum of two crew members for most railroad operations. Leadership for Norfolk Southern met with Buttigieg and other DOT officials and expressed concerns about the proposed rule. Among other issues, Norfolk Southern argues it will lead to significant labor costs Crucial to efforts to enhance rail safety, administration officials and rail experts say, is Congress' ability to untie the executive branch's hands.  DOT is asking Congress to increase the maximum fines that can be issued to rail companies for violating safety regulations. And similar to its regulatory efforts announced Tuesday, DOT is calling on Congress to expand the rules ""governing high-hazardous shipments, including high-hazard flammable trains, pushing past industry opposition"" and  follow through ""on new bipartisan support to modernize braking regulations and increase the use of electronically controlled pneumatic brakes.""  ""The apparatus that exists was to allow safety regulators to write and finalize common sense safety regulations that will protect people -- protect their homes, protect their water, protect their children, protect their health -- it's totally broken,"" Feinberg said. ""And the reason it's totally broken is because the Congress and others -- other administrations -- will insert themselves into the process and take it over ... from safety regulators and say, 'I know better and I'm going to protect the industry from whatever you're trying to force its hand on.'"" The American Association of Railroads, an industry group, has said that ""until NTSB has completed their investigation, AAR will not comment on potential policy changes in relation to this event as the cause and any underlying factors have not yet been fully determined."" The NTSB is set to release a preliminary report on the derailment investigation Thursday morning.  Bipartisan congressional efforts  Congressional committees are set to review the environmental and safety impacts of the East Palestine derailment. Although efforts to enhance regulatory oversight of the rail industry have generally broken along party lines, some Republicans and Democrats appear to be moving in the same direction. Senate Commerce Committee Chair Maria Cantwell, a Washington state Democrat, sent a letter last week to seven of the largest railroad company CEOs, inquiring about safety practices involved in rail transportation of hazardous materials. She's also requested a joint staff-level briefing with the Environment and Public Works Committee, asking federal transportation and environmental agencies to appear, according to Politico.  House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chair Sam Graves, a Missouri Republican, scheduled a bipartisan briefing for members of the committee last week, and there may be further briefings for committee and all House members to help keep them informed of the status and relevant issues, Graves' office told CNN.  Republican Sens. J.D. Vance of Ohio and Marco Rubio of Florida sent a letter to DOT requesting information about the administration's regulatory oversight, questioning whether the three crew members on board the Norfolk Southern train that derailed were enough to staff the 149-car locomotive. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, the leading Republican on the Senate Commerce committee, last week tweeted that he fully agreed with Minnesota Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, who wrote, in part, ""We need Congressional inquiry and direct action from [Buttigieg] to address this tragedy."" Biden faces pressure to go to Ohio Republican candidates for president Nikki Haley and former President Donald Trump have criticized President Joe Biden for not visiting the site of the derailment, arguing that his trip to Ukraine and Poland this week shows he's more focused on a foreign crisis than what's happening at home -- an increasingly frequent critique of the president and his administration. Trump -- whose administration sidelined the pending rule to require freight trains to have at least two crew members -- appeared in East Palestine on Wednesday alongside Vance.  Rubio and Buttigieg, meanwhile, are in a spat -- with the secretary suggesting the senator was previously parroting lines from the rail industry and Rubio calling for Buttigieg's resignation. ""Anybody who has seen fit to get on television and talk about this incident, talk about this issue, can do right by the people of East Palestine and everybody else who lives near a railroad,"" Buttigieg told CNN. ""Not just when it comes to this case, but when it comes to the future, by getting on the right side of this issue, and helping to raise -- not lower -- the bar of accountability for the railroad industry.""  Biden on Wednesday posted on Instagram about his phone call with his EPA Administrator Michael Regan and officials from Ohio and Pennsylvania to discuss the East Palestine situation. He also accused the Trump administration of limiting the ability to strengthen rail safety measures and said some of his current Republican critics were trying to dismantle the EPA.  ""The Department of Transportation has made clear to rail companies that their pattern of resisting safety regulations has got to change,"" the caption stated. ""Congress should join us in implementing rail safety measures. But the Department of Transportation is limited in the rail safety measures they can implement. Why? For years, elected officials - including the last (administration) - have limited our ability to implement and strengthen rail safety measures.""  Following repeated calls for Buttigieg to visit the Ohio site, the secretary said earlier this week that he intended to visit East Palestine when the time was right. And then on Wednesday, DOT announced that he would visit on Thursday.  A DOT spokesperson said Buttigieg had planned to go when it was ""appropriate and wouldn't detract from the emergency response efforts. The Secretary is going now that the EPA has said it is moving out of the emergency response phase and transitioning to the long-term remediation phase.""

One of the 'random people' chosen to investigate Trump goes public,2023-02-22,"It's a marvel of the American judicial system that Emily Kohrs, a 30-year-old woman who has described herself as between customer service jobs and who said she didn't vote in the 2020 presidential election, could play a pivotal role in the potential indictment of a former US president. But we're getting ahead of ourselves and so, too, may be Kohrs, the foreperson of the special grand jury empaneled from May 2022 through January 2023 to help Fulton County, Georgia, prosecutors investigate Donald Trump.  It's important to note that Trump has NOT been indicted, and it's not clear he ever will be. He denies all wrongdoing.  Fani Willis, the Fulton County district attorney who conducted the sweeping investigation in which Kohrs played a role, is still considering what, if any, charges should be brought against Trump or anyone else for trying to overturn the election in 2020. Prosecutors will make that decision -- not the special grand jury on which Kohrs served and that heard from witnesses and prepared a report and recommendations.  'Odd 15-minute PR tour' Kohrs is cagily answering questions, teasing that the special grand jury may have recommended charges for Trump and saying she hopes something comes of it all. Her identity as the foreperson was first revealed by The Associated Press, and in addition to the AP, she has, in short order, done interviews with The New York Times, NBC News, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and CNN. The former US Attorney Harry Litman said on CNN on Wednesday that prosecutors have got to be ""consternated"" that a potential jury pool could be contaminated by Kohrs' ""odd 15-minute PR tour."" But he acknowledged that her teasing suggestion that Trump could be indicted is nothing short of incredible. ""In terms of magnitude, I'm straining for the right adjectives, but it'd be the biggest thing that's happened in the criminal law perhaps in American history, right? This has never happened to a former president,"" Litman said. While federal grand juries are notoriously secret affairs, grand juries empaneled in local courts have varying rules. There's nothing in the statute about special grand juries in Georgia that says they must be secret. In fact, the statute says reports issued by special grand juries should be published if the grand jury recommends it. And Kohrs says the judge gave her and the other jurors permission to speak to the press, albeit with limitations. 'An investigative tool' In an order rejecting the request of media organizations, including CNN, to release the full report, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney noted the special grand jury is intended to aid the district attorney, not act on behalf of the court. The report, he noted, was issued to Willis, not the court. And it is ultimately up to Willis, an elected Democrat, whether to bring charges against Trump. McBurney also pointed out that what the special grand jury saw was not a trial where a defendant presents his or her side of a case, but was instead ""largely controlled by the District Attorney."" The special grand jury had 24 jurors, including alternates, although all 24 were never present to hear witness testimony together. Only Kohrs has spoken publicly so far.  Willis' office caught off guard The special grand jury is essentially ""an investigative tool"" and a ""one-sided exploration,"" McBurney said, designed to enable Willis to make her decision. McBurney released portions of the special grand jury report that said jurors wanted perjury charges brought against some witnesses. CNN's Sara Murray reported Wednesday that Willis' office was not responsible for authorizing whether or not members of the special grand jury could speak to the media and did not know ahead of time that Kohrs was going to go public, according to a source familiar with the situation. Not against any rules Anthony Michael Kreis, an assistant professor of law at Georgia State University, told Murray that while Kohrs' media tour was unusual -- particularly in a case where no one has yet faced charges -- Kohrs was within her rights to discuss the case as long as she didn't delve into grand jury deliberations. ""She didn't do anything violative of her obligations,"" Kreis said. ""I don't think she did anything that jeopardized Fani Willis' strategy or her ability to bring her case."" Kohrs told reporters McBurney gave the jury instructions, and she seemed to consider exactly how far she could go before answering reporters' individual questions -- though she also seemed to enjoy the opportunity to dish about the grand jury proceedings. Clearly excited to be part of this Kohrs was clearly tickled to play a part in the special grand jury, laughing repeatedly during an interview with CNN's Kate Bolduan on ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" Tuesday night -- and seemingly starstruck at the appearance of former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani as a witness. On the other hand, Kohrs' simple act of publicly embracing the role is a fascinating example of the US justice system, which ultimately relies on everyday people.  Trump dismissed Kohrs and the Willis investigation in a post on his social media network. ""Now you have an extremely energetic young woman, the (get this!) 'foreperson' of the Racist D.A.'s Special Grand Jury, going around and doing a Media Tour revealing, incredibly, the Grand Jury's inner workings & thoughts,"" he wrote. Here are some of the key portions of that fascinating interview with CNN. I've paraphrased Bolduan's questions and have noted Kohrs' responses in italics. How many people could be indicted? 12 people? 24 people? I think if you look at the page numbers of the report, there's about six pages in the middle that got cut out. Allow for spacing, it's not a short list.  Will Trump be indicted? I really don't want to share something that the judge made a conscious decision not to share.  I will tell you that it was a process where we heard his name a lot. We definitely heard a lot about former President Trump, and we definitely discussed him a lot in the room. And I will say that when this list comes out, you wouldn't -- there are no major plot twists waiting for you.  People are now going to assume Trump is on that list. Can you speak to that? I can't. Well, I might be able to, according to instructions. But I don't want to.  I don't want to speak out on something that the judge, like I said, consciously chose not to release at this point. I don't know if I would interfere with the DA's investigations. I don't know if I would interfere with procedures in some way. I very much do not want to cross that line.  The released portion of the report focuses on a recommendation for charges of perjury. Is perjury the main charge you recommended? I wouldn't say that. I would say that -- I would say that it ended up included there because it was less pointed of a suggestion than some of the other things we may have written in the parts of the report the judge chose to keep confidential.  The perjury recommendations were less specifically related to a person? I will say that I thought it was important to keep it separate as well, at least in my opinion, not anybody else's but mine. There's a difference between the crimes we were called to investigate and crimes that were committed in the room.  What's your lasting impression of being a part of the investigation for many months? I've loved being a part of this process. I think it's amazing to actually be able to be a part of this process for once. I think it's a privilege to be able to actually be a part of the system for once and making it work.  This has been fascinating to get this peek into the world of politics and of all these different -- of government and of all these different things and have the curtain lifted just a little bit and let us peek in as regular people has been amazing. And I'm so glad that I did it.  What do you say to people who question your findings? I think it's the opposite. I think that by choosing to have a grand jury, by choosing to impanel regular people, they very specifically chose to avoid politics, to take bias out of the question. Because they chose to get, instead of anyone else, they chose to get 16 random people.  Are you worried about your safety given the current political environment? I'm not. I'm cautious about my safety. I'm aware of my safety, but I'm not worried. I don't think I should be -- I don't think I did or any of the jury members did anything that says we believe one way or the other about politics, about any of these issues.  I think we were empaneled to find facts, and I think we did our best to find those facts and share those facts with the district attorney and her office.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",78,85.0,0.05063636363636363,0.8356363636363636,0.11363636363636363,0.29233750000000003,0.06,0.776,0.164,0.9996,22.802325000000003,34.20568333333336,242.0,0.14134579889807175
"Steve Bannon's ex-lawyers sue him over nearly $500,000 in unpaid legal bills",2023-02-22,"A law firm that represented former Donald Trump strategist Steve Bannon during his fight against a subpoena from the House January 6 committee and other cases is suing Bannon for nearly $500,000 in unpaid legal bills. The lawsuit states that Davidoff Hutcher & Citron LLP worked for Bannon from November 2020 through November 2022 and represented him on several high-profile cases, including investigations into Bannon's crowdfunding border-wall effort and the subpoena from the House select committee investigating the US Capitol attack on January 6, 2021. ""This action simply seeks payment of an outstanding bill for legal services rendered in the amount of $480,487.87 in addition to scheduling a hearing on the reasonable attorneys' fees DHC is contractually entitled to as the prevailing party in this litigation,"" the law firm wrote. Bannon's spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.  While Trump pardoned Bannon in the federal border wall case, the Manhattan DA's office announced an indictment last year charging Bannon with state charges of fraud, conspiracy and money laundering related to the effort. Bannon has pleaded not guilty to the charges. The lawyers representing him in that case -- from a different firm -- have sought to withdraw from representing him and said there were ""irreconcilable differences."" Bannon is due in court next week to update the judge on his efforts to find new lawyers. In his criminal case related to the House January 6 investigation, a jury convicted Bannon of failing to turn over documents and appearing for testimony last summer. Bannon has appealed his contempt of Congress conviction for defying the committee's subpoena. Robert Costello, an attorney at Davidoff Hutcher & Citron, had represented Bannon opposite the House subpoena, but became a witness in the case so Bannon had a different legal team at trial. The Davidoff firm said in the lawsuit that its ""bills for fees and expenses totaled $855,487.87. Defendant paid only $375,000.00 of the total bill leaving a total of $480,487.87 outstanding.""","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.88, 'pos': 0.12, 'compound': 0.128}",13,86.0,0.178,0.7785,0.0435,-0.65325,0.071,0.889,0.04,-0.855,-8.49225,25.84115833333336,216.0,0.11963499228395075
GOP 2024 hopefuls divided over US role in Ukraine war,2023-02-21,"The Republican rift over the United States' support for Ukraine was on vivid display this week, as 2024 presidential hopefuls staked out opposing positions on whether President Joe Biden's administration has done too much or too little to help the country a year into Russia's invasion. The divide over the US role in Ukraine is one of the opening fault lines of a GOP race that is only beginning to take shape -- and one that could become a heated topic when Republican primary debates begin in the coming months.  What GOP presidential candidates, and those taking steps toward entering the race, broadly agree on is that Biden has mishandled the situation.  But those hopefuls are split into two camps: Isolationists, particularly former President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who believe the United States is too involved in supporting Ukraine's efforts to fend off the Russian invasion; and hawks, including several former Trump administration officials, who argue for an even more aggressive posture toward Russia. Both sides are warning that if their positions aren't heeded, a world war could follow.  Trump and DeSantis both accused Biden of provoking unnecessary clashes with global powers by traveling to Ukraine on Monday.  Meanwhile, Nikki Haley, the former United Nations ambassador who last week became the second major candidate to declare her candidacy, took the opposite position in stops in New Hampshire and Iowa, arguing for a more forceful US role.  ""It's more than just about Ukraine. This is a war about freedom. And it's a war we have to win,"" the former South Carolina governor said Monday night in Urbandale, Iowa.  Trump this week has repeatedly lambasted Biden for his Kyiv trip. ""World War III has never been closer than it is right now,"" Trump said Tuesday in a video in which he pledged to ""clean house of all of the warmongers and America-Last globalists in the Deep State, the Pentagon, the State Department, and the national security industrial complex.""  Trump also sent supporters a fundraising email claiming Biden is defending other countries' borders -- a clear reference to Ukraine -- but putting Americans ""dead last.""  And on his social media network, Truth Social, Trump said: ""If you watch and understand the moves being made by Biden on Ukraine, he is systematically, but perhaps unknowingly, pushing us into what could soon be WORLD WAR III."" But Haley is among the latter group, telling voters in Iowa that stopping Russian President Vladimir Putin's ambitions in Ukraine is necessary to prevent ""world war.""  She, too, faulted Biden -- but said the president has been too ""slow to the take"" and that he emboldened Putin with the United States' withdrawal from Afghanistan. She said the United States should continue supplying Ukraine with military equipment and ammunition.  ""If we win this fight for freedom it will send a signal to every enemy we have. If we lose this fight for freedom, Russia has said Poland and the Baltics are next and then we've got a world war,"" she said.  Other prominent Republicans have similarly argued for a forceful US role in Ukraine. Former Vice President Mike Pence, who has said he is considering a 2024 run, said in an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity on Tuesday that the US has ""got to stay in the fight"" in backing Ukraine against Russia's invasion. ""We are involved in a proxy war against the Soviet Union, the Ukrainians are fighting it. And I really believe that it is essential that we see it through. We demand our European allies do more than their share because it is their front yard. But I think it is absolutely essential that after a slow start in providing support to the Ukrainian military by the Biden administration, we're now providing that support. But let's get them what they need, the tanks, let's get them the F-16s and support them as they finish this fight,"" Pence said. Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who is also considering a 2024 presidential bid, said Tuesday that Biden's trip was ""a great moment for America.""  ""We need to applaud this. This is a good moment for our country, and in those that respect, freedom and sovereignty, and those that are fighting against oppression,"" the former two-term Republican governor said Tuesday during an interview on Fox News host Brian Kilmeade's radio show. DeSantis -- who this week made appearances on Fox News and traveled to New York, Philadelphia and Chicago, delivering what could be a preview of his potential 2024 message -- appears to be attempting to out-flank Trump in opposing Biden's approach to the war.  DeSantis on Monday criticized American aid to Ukraine as an ""open-ended blank check"" and questioned whether the United States should be engaged in the Russian conflict at all. ""I don't think it's in our interest to be getting into a proxy war with China, getting involved over things like the Borderlands or over Crimea,"" DeSantis told ""Fox & Friends,"" referring to Ukrainian territories that Russia has seized through military force. Asked on the program ""what a win looks like"" for the United States, DeSantis demurred and instead downplayed Russia's military actions to date, saying the country was ""really wounded"" and suffered ""tremendous, tremendous loses"" without acknowledging the role that US weapons, military intelligence and aid have played in shaping the conflict.  DeSantis insisted Russia is not a threat ""on the same level as China"" -- a remark that is a stark departure from the years he spent in Congress as a hawk on the issue as a member of the House Freedom Caucus, casting former President Barack Obama as weak in his approach to Russia.  ""The fear of Russia going into NATO countries and all that, and steamrolling, that has not even come close to happening,"" DeSantis said Monday. ""I think they have shown themselves to be a third-rate military power."" GOP rift over Ukraine One of the earliest clashes of the 2024 race -- playing out with only two candidates officially having entered the Republican primary -- is taking place against the backdrop of a broader debate within the GOP over the United States' role in the war in Ukraine and its broader foreign policy obligations.  Biden's trip to Ukraine on Monday, meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to show support for Kyiv nearly a year into Russia's invasion and announce another $500 million in US assistance, was met with strident criticism from Republicans who have aligned themselves with Trump.  Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia said Biden's visit demonstrated an ""America last"" policy. ""This is incredibly insulting. Today on our President's Day, Joe Biden, the President of the United States chose Ukraine over America, while forcing the American people to pay for Ukraine's government and war,"" Greene said in a tweet. Greene was one of 11 House Republicans who co-sponsored a ""Ukraine Fatigue"" resolution earlier this month. The resolution called for suspending military and financial aid to Ukraine. Other House Republicans have urged Biden to increase support for Ukraine.  Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, at the Munich Security Conference on Friday, pledged GOP support for Ukraine and NATO and argued for boosting military spending. He also insisted Republicans are committed to global leadership.  ""Don't look at Twitter. Look at the people in power, like me and Speaker Kevin McCarthy,"" he said.   South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said in a statement he was ""very pleased"" Biden visited Ukraine.  ""This was the right signal to send at the right time,"" Graham said.  The debate over Republicans' approach to the war in Ukraine is being shaped in part by polling that shows GOP voters are less likely than Democratic voters to support the United States playing a major role.  About a year after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, recent polling suggests there's been a slight decline in support for US intervention in the war and a growing sense that the United States is doing too much, particularly among Republicans.  A Quinnipiac University poll this month found that 40% of Americans feel the United States is doing the right amount to help Ukraine, with 30% saying the United States is doing too much and 22% too little.  Republicans are most likely to say that the US is doing too much (47%, compared with 35% among independents and 9% among Democrats), while a majority of Democrats say the effort is about right (56% among Democrats compared with 39% among independents and 30% among Republicans). An AP-NORC survey conducted in late January found that most Americans feel the United States should have a role in the Russia-Ukraine war at 75%, including 26% who say the United States should have a major role in the conflict. Democrats, at 40%, were more apt than Republicans, at 17%, to say the United States should be playing a major role.  A Fox News poll in late January found that about half of registered voters in the United States think that Ukraine is winning the war against Russia (51% said so, while 34% think Russia is winning and 9% say neither are), and that most want to continue supplying weapons (64%) or money (63%) to Ukraine. Other Republicans who are considering 2024 runs, including members of Trump's former administration, have similarly argued that the United States should take a more active role in opposing Russia's war in Ukraine.  Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Fox News last month that the United States ""should be doing everything the Ukrainians are asking us to do.""  He noted that Ukrainian leaders have not asked for direct US military support. ""They've simply said, provide us the stuff we need. And it is their lives that are at risk,"" Pompeo said.  ""Helping America means a sovereign nation that is prepared to defend itself from an invasion and an attack where civilians are being killed by Vladimir Putin is in America's best interest for our economy, for our security,"" he said.  Pence has also sought to steer the Republican Party toward a more aggressive posture against Russia, denouncing ""Putin apologists.""  He warned conservatives in a speech at the Heritage Foundation in October against being ""led astray by the siren song of unprincipled populism that's unmoored from our oldest traditions and most cherished values.""  ""As Russia continues its unconscionable war of aggression to Ukraine, I believe that conservatives must make it clear that Putin must stop and Putin will pay,"" he added. ""There can be no room in the conservative movement for apologists to Putin. There is only room in this movement for champions of freedom.""

Ben Platt speaks out against antisemitic protests of 'Parade' on Broadway,2023-02-22,"Audiences at the first preview of the Broadway revival of ""Parade,"" a musical about the dangers of hatred, were met by a group of antisemitic protesters, who gathered outside the theater before the show, said Ben Platt, a Tony Award winner who stars in the musical.  Ultimately, though, the group's presence only reinforced that ""now is really the moment' to perform this show, Platt said in a video on Instagram.  Platt, who plays Leo Frank, a Jewish man who faced antisemitic hate in 1900s Georgia, said the protesters harassed audience members on their way into the theater and said hateful things about Frank, ""spreading antisemitic rhetoric that led to this whole story in the first place.""  Playbill reported that the protesters ""carried signs with hateful rhetoric,"" shouted at audience members waiting to enter the theater and attempted to hand out fliers.  ""It was definitely very ugly and scary but a wonderful reminder of why we're telling this particular story and how special and powerful art and, particularly, theater can be,"" Platt said in the video. ""And it just made me feel extra, extra grateful to be the one that gets to tell this particular story and to carry on this legacy of Leo."" ""Parade"" follows the true story of Leo Frank, a Jewish factory superintendent in Georgia who was accused and eventually convicted of murdering a young factory employee in 1913. Though Frank maintained his innocence throughout his trial, he was kidnapped from prison and lynched by a mob. Per the New Georgia Encyclopedia, his trial was a ""miscarriage of justice"" fueled by antisemitism in the South, among other social issues.  Platt noted that security at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre kept the cast and audience members safe during the protests.  ""I just wanted the button on the evening, at least for me, personally to be to celebrate what a beautiful experience it is,"" he said. ""Not the really ugly actions of a few people who are spreading evil."" ""Parade"" producers shared a statement on Instagram condemning the antisemitic protests.  ""If there is any remaining doubt out there about the urgency of telling this story in this moment in history, the vileness on display in front of our theater last night should put it to rest,"" they wrote. ""We stand by the valiant Broadway cast that brings this vital story to life each night.""  Antisemitic attacks have been on the rise in the last few years, hitting an all-time high in 2019, according to the Anti-Defamation League. The ADL reported earlier this year that 85% of Americans believe in at least one anti-Jewish trope, which the organization said can lead to violence against Jewish people. Celebrities including Kanye West and Kyrie Irving have shared antisemitic posts on social media, and former President Donald Trump dined with West and White nationalist and Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes late last year.  Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, who leads the Tree of Life Congregation in Pittsburgh, where 11 people were killed by a White supremacist, told CNN last year that it's not on victims of antisemitic hate to battle it alone. ""It doesn't end with antisemitism,"" Myers said. ""From antisemitism, it moves on to another minority group and another minority group until there's no one left to call out because all of the groups are no longer around.""","{'neg': 0.16, 'neu': 0.84, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.2263}",20,88.0,0.07,0.864,0.067,-0.0258,0.131,0.762,0.107,-0.9165,-0.516,-4.257166666666636,241.0,-0.017664591977869862
Lawyers for Proud Boys member take steps to subpoena former President Trump in seditious conspiracy trial,2023-02-22,"Lawyers for a Proud Boys member on trial for seditious conspiracy related to his alleged role in the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol are taking steps to subpoena former President Donald Trump to testify as a witness for the defense.  It's a longshot bid as judges have previously rejected subpoenas for Trump and arguments that rioters were obeying his orders in other trials of January 6 defendants. Trump's lawyers also wouldn't accept service of any subpoena for him unless they had extensive discussions about it first, according to a source familiar with the matter, and they have not decided on a Proud Boys trial subpoena.   The Justice Department has not indicated in court, or in the email to defense attorneys, whether it plans to try to quash this subpoena.  But DOJ has informed defense lawyers they can contact Trump's attorney Evan Corcoran, according to an email reviewed by CNN. If he refuses to accept service, the Justice Department said they can reach out to the Secret Service's Miami field office to facilitate the process, or ask the court to order the US Marshals Service to serve the subpoena.  The subpoena asks for Trump to come to the federal courthouse in Washington, DC, on March 1, but bringing Trump into court is likely an uphill battle. Trump's attorneys also could move to quash the subpoena, and federal prosecutors still have the ability to argue that his testimony isn't relevant to the ongoing trial.  A federal prosecutor on the case declined to comment. Norman Pattis, a lawyer who represents defendant Joseph Biggs, announced the subpoena in court last week and asked for the government's assistance in serving the subpoena. Pattis told CNN on Wednesday that he had reached out to Corcoran about the subpoena and has not received a response. Pattis added that he also has reached out to the Secret Service in Miami. CNN has reached out to Corcoran for comment.  Biggs and his four co-defendants are on trial for their alleged participation in the January 6 US Capitol insurrection, and all five have pleaded not guilty.   Attorneys for the five defendants in this case, including Biggs, previously asked a federal judge to allow them to argue to a jury that Trump ordered their clients to storm the Capitol on January 6. District Judge Timothy Kelly rejected the argument, saying that Trump did not have the authority to order a mob to storm the Capitol.   Pattis told CNN that serving Trump with the subpoena is ""the first of many steps"" in the process of getting the former president to testify in the high-profile sedition trial. Pattis also said he anticipates lawyers for Trump will move to stop the subpoena.   ""I presented to the United States government a signed subpoena requiring the presence of Donald J. Trump at the Proud Boy trial sometime in March,"" Pattis said on his podcast ""Law and Legitimacy"" last week. ""We're hoping that Mr. Trump -- ambitious as he is -- recognizes that this is an opportunity for him to begin to explain to the public his position on 'Stopping the Steal.'""  ""We have drawn the line,"" Pattis continued. ""We have asked Mr. Trump to join us, and our position is, Mr. President, you urged patriots to stop the steal in 2020 and early 2021. We have a simpler request: Take the stand.""  Pattis added that they want to question Trump on the period between November 3, 2020 and January 6, 2021.   Pattis has not said publicly what he would hope to elicit from Trump's testimony, but several defense lawyers representing Proud Boys members have argued during this trial that their clients were called to action by the former president when he told the far-right group to ""stand back and stand by"" during a 2020 presidential debate, and that the Proud Boys believed they were acting at his behest on January 6.   ""You see Trump, President Trump, told them the election was stolen. It was Trump that told them to go [to the Capitol]. And it was Trump that unleashed them on January 6,"" Sabino Jauregui, the attorney for former Proud Boys chairman Enrique Tarrio, told jurors during his opening statement last month.  ""It's too hard to blame Trump,"" Jauregui said. ""It's too hard to bring him in here with his army of lawyers. ... Instead, they go for the easy target. They go for Enrique Tarrio.""

Foreperson on Georgia grand jury investigating Trump and 2020 election: 'I don't think you will be shocked' by indictments,2023-02-21,"The foreperson of the Atlanta-based grand jury that investigated former President Donald Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 election told CNN on Tuesday that the panel is recommending multiple indictments and suggested ""the big name"" may be on the list. ""Can you imagine doing this for eight months and not coming out with a whole list"" of recommended indictments, Emily Kohrs told CNN. ""It's not a short list. It's not."" She continued, ""There may be some names on that list that you wouldn't expect. But the big name that everyone keeps asking me about -- I don't think you will be shocked."" Kohrs declined later Tuesday to disclose exactly how many indictments the special grand jury recommended be brought as part of the investigation, saying only that she believes it is more than 12.  Asked by CNN's Kate Bolduan on ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" whether the number of people was ""more than a dozen,"" Kohrs replied: ""I believe so. That's probably a good assumption.""  Portions of the grand jury's final report, released last week, made it clear that the grand jury believed perjury charges were warranted for some witnesses. The foreperson's identity was first revealed by The Associated Press. And earlier on Tuesday, Kohrs told The New York Times that the grand jury recommended multiple indictments, though she didn't provide names.  The grand jury met for about seven months in Atlanta and heard testimony from 75 witnesses, including some of Trump's closest advisers from his final weeks in the White House. Now that the grand jury is finished, it's up to Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis to review the recommendations and make charging decisions. Willis' decisions in this case will reverberate in the 2024 presidential campaign and beyond. Trump, who has launched his 2024 campaign for the White House, denies any criminal wrongdoing. He has claimed that Willis, a Democrat, is politically biased, and still regularly promotes the false claim that he actually won the election in Georgia. Jurors, Kohrs told Bolduan, ""definitely heard a lot about former President Trump and we definitely discussed him a lot in the room.""  Kohrs said that as part of the probe, she heard Trump on calls separate from the infamous post-election one he made to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a fellow Republican, asking him to ""find"" the votes necessary to win Georgia.   ""Yes, I am positive I have heard the president on the phone more than once,"" she said. CNN previously reported that at least one additional call by Trump to a Georgia state official was part of the investigation.  Willis' office was not responsible for authorizing whether or not members of the special grand jury could speak to the media and did not know ahead of time that Kohrs was going to go public, according to a source familiar with the situation. 'I don't believe there was bias' Despite Trump's claims that the prosecutors are liberal zealots on a ""witch hunt,"" Kohrs said she believed Willis and her team acted in a non-partisan fashion and tried to keep the proceedings fair.  ""I don't believe there was bias on the part of the DA's team,"" she told CNN in the phone interview. ""I know for a fact that they were always very worried about accidentally coloring our opinions one way or the other ... They told us that they didn't want any of their opinions to affect any of our opinions, or any of their additional knowledge to affect our knowledge.""  She said the prosecutors told her that they wanted the grand jury to ""make your opinions"" independently and to ""look straight at this by yourselves.""  Kohrs called on Willis to take ""decisive action,"" now that the fate of the investigation is in her hands. ""Personally, I hope to see her take almost any kind of decisive action, to actually do something,"" Kohrs said. ""There are too many times in recent history that seem to me like someone has gotten called out for something that people had a problem with, and nothing ever happens."" Kohrs said there are too many examples of ""famous people"" avoiding accountability after high-profile investigations. ""How often does something actually happen? I would love to see something actually happen. Don't make me take back my faith in the system,"" Kohrs said. ""The only thing I would be disappointed in, at this point, is if this whole thing just disappears. That's the only thing that would make me sad."" Witnesses before her grand jury The foreperson also told CNN that she was ""pleasantly surprised"" by the friendliness of some witnesses, including key Trump insiders like former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn, even though he invoked privilege and declined to answer some questions.   ""Some of those people fought not to be there, but once they were there, they were willing to have a conversation, and I respect the hell out of that,"" Kohrs said. ""Flynn was honestly very nice in person. He was a very nice man. He was definitely interesting. But I don't recall him saying anything earth-shattering."" Using the Fifth Amendment or citing various legal privileges was a strategy that the grand jury saw from several of the most prominent witnesses, including Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, according to Kohrs.  ""Mark Meadows did not share very much,"" she said. ""I asked if he had Twitter, and he pled the Fifth."" CNN has reached out to Meadows' attorney for comment about claims from Kohrs that he repeatedly invoked the Fifth and executive privilege.   Separately, a source familiar with the matter confirmed Mike Pence's former chief of staff Marc Short appeared before the special grand jury under subpoena. His appearance was previously reported by The Associated Press. The Georgia investigation has long been seen as one of Trump's biggest unsettled legal vulnerabilities, though any prosecution of him would be ripe for constitutional challenges and would face more scrutiny than perhaps any previous case initiated by a local prosecutor. In addition, Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith is investigating Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 election, his role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection, and his possible mishandling of classified material. In New York, a criminal probe led by the Manhattan district attorney is still underway, and Trump's namesake business is fighting a civil fraud lawsuit from the state attorney general.

Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg to visit Ohio town affected by toxic train derailment on Thursday,2023-02-22,"Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg will visit the site of the train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, on Thursday. The secretary has come under intense pressure from East Palestine residents and other critics to visit the town in the wake of the February 3 derailment of a Norfolk Southern train that released toxic chemicals. He told reporters earlier this week that he would visit ""when the time is right"" but was deferring to the National Transportation Safety Board and its investigation first. An administration official told CNN that the time is now appropriate for Buttigieg to go to East Palestine.  ""The Secretary is going now that the EPA has said it is moving out of the emergency response phase and transitioning to the long-term remediation phase. His visit also coincides with the NTSB issuing its factual findings of the investigation into the cause of the derailment and will allow the secretary to hear from USDOT investigators who were on the ground within hours of the derailment to support the NTSB's investigation,"" the official said. ""The Environmental Protection Agency is leading the Federal response to hold Norfolk Southern accountable and make the company clean up its mess. That is how it works in response to a chemical spill. The Department of Transportation will continue to do its part by helping get to the bottom of what caused the derailment and implementing rail safety measures, and we hope this sudden bipartisan support for rail safety will result in meaningful changes in Congress."" Anger in the small town near the Ohio-Pennsylvania border has been rising, both at Norfolk Southern for the derailment itself and the government for its response. While EPA Administrator Michael Regan has been to the town multiple times since the derailment, demands for Buttigieg to visit have been heard repeatedly in public forums. In response to the criticism, Buttigieg said Tuesday on CBS News he ""could have spoken out sooner."" ""I was focused on just making sure that our folks on the ground were all set but could have spoken sooner about how strongly I felt about this incident and that's a lesson learned for me,"" Buttigieg said. The visit will come a day after former President Donald Trump visits East Palestine. When asked about Trump's visit on Monday, Buttigieg said he would ""stay on the right side of the Hatch Act,"", referencing a federal law that seeks to keep government functions nonpartisan. But he appeared to take issue with what he sees as political opportunists whose past policies may have encouraged the deregulation of the rail industry. ""Whether we're talking about elected officials or anybody else showing up, there is a chance for everybody who has a public voice on this issue to demonstrate whether they are interested in helping the people of East Palestine or using the people of East Palestine,"" he said in response to the question about Trump, who has launched a 2024 White House bid. Buttigieg has previewed new rail safety efforts in a recent letter to Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw earlier this week, demanding accountability and calling for greater safety regulations. And while much of the Department of Transportation's newly announced efforts in the wake of the derailment focus on calls to Congress and the private sector to work to bolster rail safety, he said his agency will enhance its work as well. A DOT news release states that the agency will continue to press to advance the ""Train Crew Staffing Rule,"" which would require a minimum of two crew members during most railroad operations. Norfolk Southern has opposed the proposed rule.

Biden's momentous 72 hours in Europe steels the West for the next stage of Russia's war in Ukraine,2023-02-22,"President Joe Biden barely slept as he rolled in the dark toward Kyiv earlier this week, sitting awake as his curtained-off train car crossed into the warzone that has come to shape so much of his presidency. Biden departed Europe three days later having loudly recommitted to backing Ukraine as it enters a second year of conflict, working to cast aside doubts about the durability of American support and directly blaming his counterpart in the Kremlin for thrusting the continent into war. The 72 hours Biden spent on the ground in Ukraine and Poland have been among the most momentous of his presidency, the culmination both of careful, highly secretive planning by White House aides and the president's singular, decades-held view of America's role in the world. In conversations with aides, foreign counterparts and even by phone with his wife over the course of his visit, Biden has asserted his trip this week was essential in showing the world the US wouldn't waver in its support. As Air Force One returns to Washington, however, it is difficult to ignore the looming questions Biden's visit did little to answer: How and when the war will end. ""There will continue to be hard and very bitter days, victories and tragedies,"" Biden said in remarks from the gardens of Warsaw Castle, lit dramatically and crowded with a flag-waving audience of thousands. ""But Ukraine is steeled for the fight ahead. And the United States, together with our allies and partners, are going to continue to have Ukraine's back as it defends itself."" Biden did not necessarily set out on this week's trip to provide a better picture of the war's endgame, nor is he actively nudging the Ukrainians toward the negotiating table with Russia. Indeed, Biden and his aides do not view Russian President Vladimir Putin as anywhere close to seeking a settlement in the war, an impression only reinforced by Putin's belligerent and, in their view, delusional speech from Moscow on Tuesday. Yet underneath Biden's pledges of continued support for Ukraine remains a lingering concern, shared with his European allies, that the war could descend into a stalemate as each side sees small gains and losses without a clear trajectory. What comes next The massive influx of weapons, ammunition and armor sent by the United States and other countries over the past few months was intended, in large part, to help Ukraine secure battlefield gains that could strengthen its position at a to-be-determined negotiating table with Russia. There have been persistent concerns at how Ukraine is using those resources among some US and European officials, who have encouraged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to focus on planning and executing a spring counteroffensive rather than waging battle on multiple fronts, some with less strategic importance than others. In their closed-door conversation in Kyiv on Monday, Biden and Zelensky ""spent time talking about the coming months, in terms of the battlefield, and what Ukraine will need in terms of capabilities to be able to succeed on the battlefield,"" according to US national security adviser Jake Sullivan, one of the tiny number of aides who accompanied the president on his covert visit to Ukraine. Tellingly, Sullivan said much of Biden's focus during the day-long journey into the warzone was spent plotting out how he would raise those issues with Zelensky when they sat down to talk inside the gold-and-white Mariinsky Palace in Kyiv. ""He was quite focused on how he was going to approach his conversation with President Zelensky and, in part, how the two of them were really going to look out over the course of 2023 and try to come to a common understanding of what the objectives are, where Ukraine is trying to get and how the United States can most effectively support them alongside our allies and partners in getting to where it wants to get,"" he said. Afterward, Biden's aides were tight-lipped about how exactly that discussion went, beyond saying there would be follow-up conversations among US and Ukrainian officials in the coming days and weeks.  Almost certainly raised in the talks were Zelensky's perpetual requests for more sophisticated weapons, including longer-range missiles and fighter jets. Some of Biden's other allies in the region have advocated for sending that kind of advanced weaponry as they look to provide Ukraine any kind of advantage in the ongoing war. In earlier meetings, Zelensky had also asked if the White House could devote some members of the US team to help further develop a 10-point peace proposal he first unveiled last year. Yet that work remains ongoing, and there was little talk of peace talks during Biden's trip this week. Biden headed back to Washington aboard Air Force One on Wednesday evening local time. He tripped as he ascended the steps onto the plane, catching himself on a stair before recovering and going inside for the roughly nine-hour flight back to the nation's capital. Biden and Putin steel themselves for a long conflict Instead, the president focused his remarks in Warsaw -- a landmark address he's been developing for weeks -- on heralding the continued resistance of the Ukrainians and accusing Putin of a litany of atrocities. ""President Putin chose this war,"" he declared. ""Every day the war continues is his choice. He could end the war with a word."" A few hours earlier and several hundred miles away, Putin was delivering his own important speech to political and military elite, offering a dramatically different narrative of the war as he accused the West of turning Ukraine into a global confrontation. The differences between the two speeches were stark, both in content and character. Biden was introduced in Warsaw to a pulsing pop anthem; Putin seemed to put some members of his audience to sleep with his hour-and-45-minute address. On Wednesday, Biden said it was a ""big mistake"" for Putin to announce that he was suspending his country's participation in the New START nuclear arms reduction treaty. For as divergent as the two men's speeches were, however, they did seem to agree that the war in Ukraine would not end in the near term. ""We have to be honest and clear-eyed as we look at the year ahead. The defense of freedom is not the work of a day or of a year. It's always difficult, it's always important,"" Biden said. Biden's aides said his remarks were intended for a multitude of audiences: The besieged Ukrainian people, a Polish population that has borne much of the outside burden, Russians who may be disillusioned by their leaders' failings. But, at least in the view of some on his team, most important were listeners in the United States, thousands of miles from the frontlines, without a direct stake in the war and -- according to polls -- softening in their support for continued US assistance. Commitment questions at home Biden's critics used his trip this week to paint him as inattentive to his own country's needs, seizing upon a toxic chemical spill caused by a train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, as an example of an American crisis deserving his attention. ""Can we first acknowledge the fact that yes, Biden is over in Poland, but shouldn't he be with those people in Ohio?"" asked Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and US ambassador to the United Nations who is now seeking the Republican presidential nomination, during a campaign stop in Iowa. ""You always, you have to always during any time of crisis go to your people immediately."" Following his speech Tuesday in Warsaw, Biden did speak by telephone from his hotel with the governors of Ohio and Pennsylvania, along with the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, to discuss the situation.  ""I reaffirmed my commitment to making sure they have everything they need,"" he wrote in a caption accompanying a photo of the call that was posted on Instagram. But he also used the opportunity to blast Republicans -- including former President Donald Trump, who is set to visit East Palestine on Wednesday -- for loosing regulations and making it more difficult to strengthen rail safety. Biden's aides ultimately believe Republican members of Congress will continue to provide support for Ukraine, buoyed by the staunch backing of GOP leaders Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy despite the protestations of some of their party's members. Even so, the criticism this week that Biden is overly focused abroad is telling, particularly from a Republican like Haley, who had assumed a more traditional view of America's role in the world. Perhaps the most impassioned call this week for sustained American involvement in Europe did not come from Biden himself, for whom the concept is innate, but from Polish President Andrzej Duda, once a top ally of Trump who even proposed naming a military base ""Fort Trump"" in honor of his friend. Initially viewed skeptically by the Biden administration for his human rights record and reversal of certain democratic norms, Duda has emerged as the United States' top partner in Eastern Europe amid the raging war in Ukraine, overseeing a massive influx of refugees and turning Poland into a logistics hub for the shipments of Western military assistance over the border. Speaking across the table from Biden on Tuesday, Duda placed this week's events within a century-old context of robust American presence on the continent. ""The United States ... has demonstrated on multiple occasions its responsibility for European matters during the First World War, during the Second World War, during the Cold War. Every single time, they restored the democratic rules. Every time, the United States brought back freedom,"" he said. ""All of us,"" he went on, ""we're looking at what you did yesterday, and we believe that America is able to maintain the global order.""","{'neg': 0.187, 'neu': 0.813, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.5994}",53,92.0,0.039,0.753,0.20850000000000002,0.8448,0.097,0.79,0.113,0.9693,44.7744,65.95091875000003,174.0,0.3790282686781611
DeSantis gets 7-figure checks from top GOP donors as he soft launches presidential campaign,2023-02-22,"As Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis intensifies his preparation for a White House bid, several of the wealthiest and most prolific Republican donors are already giving him a major financial boost. Trader and investor Jeffrey Yass donated $2.5 million to DeSantis' state political committee on February 7, according to online records maintained by the organization, Friends of Ron DeSantis. And Jude and Christopher Reyes, the billionaire brothers behind one of the country's largest beer and food distributors, each gave DeSantis' committee $1 million last week as well.  The seven-figure checks arrived ahead of what has amounted to a late-February soft launch of DeSantis' highly anticipated run for president. On Monday, DeSantis held campaign-style rallies with police officers in New York, Philadelphia and Chicago, where he regaled the crowds with stories of the culture wars. Ahead of a potential GOP primary clash with Donald Trump, DeSantis will next host a three-day retreat for donors this weekend in Trump's neighborhood. And his memoir, ""The Courage to Be Free,"" drops next Tuesday, with plans for a national book tour and events scheduled with GOP activists in Texas, California and Alabama. This cascade of activity is the clearest sign yet that DeSantis intends to jump into the Republican primary, though he's in no rush to do so. Even as Trump channels his energy at derailing DeSantis, the Florida governor is sticking to plans to wait on a formal announcement until May or June, after state lawmakers hold their annual legislative session, according to sources close to the governor. DeSantis seemed to confirm the timeline during a Monday appearance on Fox & Friends. ""We're going to sell some books. We're going to spread the message of Florida. And then on March 8, I have our legislative session that's kicking off,"" DeSantis said. ""As we get beyond that, then we decide from there."" ""Wouldn't you guys like to have that announcement on 'Fox & Friends'?"" he later teased. The continued financial support from wealthy donors -- achieved without actually declaring himself a candidate -- explains, in part, why DeSantis is content to remain on the sidelines. In addition to the $4.5 million from Yass and the Reyes brothers, DeSantis' political committee has more than $71 million left over from last year's reelection effort, when he shattered fundraising records en route to a lopsided 19-point victory in the Sunshine State. CNN reached out to Yass and the Reyes brothers through their respective businesses to inquire about their donations to DeSantis' political committee, but they did not respond. DeSantis' cash on hand would put him on nearly equal footing with Trump, who had more than $81 million stockpiled across five committees when campaign finance figures were last reported in January, and far ahead of any other competitor trying to usurp the former president for the party's 2024 GOP nomination. It remains to be seen how DeSantis' political operation will move his reserve cash, which is parked in a state political committee, into a federal super PAC that could support his presidential campaign without violating campaign finance laws, however; CNN previously reported that is ultimately the goal. A source close to DeSantis' political team confirmed a recent report from Puck that Phil Cox, a veteran GOP operative and a top adviser to DeSantis' 2020 campaign, is in the process of recruiting a team to helm that effort. Cox previously ran the super PAC tied to former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's 2016 presidential campaign.  A spokesman for DeSantis' political operation declined to comment on plans for the money left over from the 2022 election. Friends of Ron DeSantis received about $670,000 in contributions in December and January, according to state records. The early support from the upper echelon of GOP mega donors -- many of whom have been shopping for an alternative to Trump -- could also make it difficult for other would-be contenders to launch a viable bid for the nomination. Yass, the world's 42nd richest person with an estimated wealth of $30 billion according to Forbes, made his presence felt during the midterms, donating more than $55 million to Republican causes in federal campaigns. That doesn't include the millions Yass spent in his home state of Pennsylvania ahead of the primary for governor there last year, trying to boost Bill McSwain over the far-right election denier Doug Mastriano. Mastriano ultimately won the GOP nomination with Trump's support but lost the general election to Democrat Josh Shapiro. The only donors to spend more money than Yass during the last cycle -- billionaire hedge fund manager Kenneth Griffin and Wisconsin shipping magnates Elizabeth and Richard Uihlein -- have also supported DeSantis in the past. The Uihleins donated just under $2 million to the Republican's two gubernatorial campaigns. Griffin, who has vocally called for the GOP to move on from Trump, has twice cut DeSantis' committee checks for $5 million and has already expressed interest in supporting him in the presidential primary. En route to raising $213 million for his reelection, the most ever by a non-self-funded gubernatorial candidate, DeSantis collected nearly 300 donations of six figures or higher. DeSantis-Trump donor duel in Palm Beach Many of his top donors will be in Palm Beach, Florida, this weekend, where DeSantis has assembled about 150 donors for an exclusive retreat on the same barrier island that Trump calls home. The summit will include policy and strategy sessions during the day and dinner, cocktails and cigars in the evening. It's an opportunity for the GOP money class to see another side of DeSantis, who has earned a reputation for shunning donors at receptions and ducking out of events with guests still waiting for a photo. ""That's the undertone of the whole thing,"" said a Republican consultant familiar with the retreat's planning. ""He's showing his people that he appreciates them and they're in the tent and their voices are meaningful and impactful. I think it's about strengthening those relationships and showing they care."" DeSantis' public maneuvering has increasingly drawn the ire of Trump, whose super PAC, MAGA, Inc, is hosting its first major fundraiser at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach on Thursday. In his latest criticism of his one-time ally, Trump said Florida ""was doing great long before"" DeSantis became governor, while praising the leadership of former governors Rick Scott and Charlie Crist. Beyond his public attacks, Trump has privately expressed annoyance to allies about DeSantis' 2024 ambitions as recently as this weekend, a source told CNN.  Trump's remarks come on the heels of the warm reception DeSantis received from law enforcement during his three-stop tour through Democratic turf on Monday. DeSantis was ostensibly on the road to make a sales pitch for police to move to Florida and tout his tough-on-crime policies, but it was clear that those in the crowds were already seizing up the Florida governor as a possible alternative to Trump. At DeSantis' stop in Elmhurst, Illinois, Joe McGraw, an Illinois circuit court judge, said DeSantis was ""electric"" and that it was ""pretty much unanimous"" among attendees that DeSantis should seek the GOP presidential nomination. Bob Kopp, a 71-year-old pastor and police chaplain, said he liked Trump's record, voted for him twice and would vote for him again -- but also called the former president ""an insufferable narcissist."" ""It was so nice to hear someone reflect American values in a hopeful, positive -- it wasn't really demeaning of anybody,"" he said of DeSantis. ""He spoke of positive principles and values, and didn't get into personalities and demeaning.""  DeSantis' arrival in New York City put the governor in the heart of Trump's turf in his former home --  Staten Island, the only of the five New York boroughs that Trump won in 2020. DeSantis spoke to police officers for 20 minutes and stopped for bagels, where he posed for photos and reportedly shrugged off questions about his political ambitions.  ""People can see with their own eyes that things are going well in Florida, so I'm not surprised that his message is resonating. If and when he decides to get in he'll have to convince people that his vision is best for America,"" said New York City councilman Joe Borelli, who met with DeSantis during the visit. ""I think it's going to be a tough choice for Republicans. We're glad he came, and maybe dipped his foot in the water here, but we certainly welcome a visit from the former president and anyone else.""","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.878, 'pos': 0.122, 'compound': 0.2023}",55,93.0,0.04364285714285715,0.8634285714285715,0.09278571428571429,0.29042142857142866,0.029,0.843,0.128,0.9994,15.973178571428576,82.44009732142861,209.0,0.39445022641831873

Immigration The Biden administration released a new rule Tuesday that largely bars migrants who traveled through other countries on their way to the US-Mexico border from applying for asylum in the US, marking a departure from decadeslong protocol. The proposed rule, which could affect tens of thousands of people, has garnered wide condemnation from Democratic lawmakers and immigrant advocates alike. Though it is reminiscent of a Trump-era policy, White House officials on Tuesday rejected the comparison to the Trump administration, saying that it's not a categorical ban on asylum and emphasized efforts to expand access to legal pathways to the US. The rule will likely take effect in May when a pandemic-era border restriction known as Title 42 is set to expire. 2. Winter storm More than 65 million people in the US are under winter weather alerts today as a massive coast-to-coast storm hits the country with heavy snow and high winds. The alerts extend from as far west as California to Minnesota through Maine, but the Upper Midwest is expected to bear the brunt of the storm in terms of snowfall totals. Minnesota's Minneapolis area is at the highest risk to pick up at least 15 inches of snow, according to the latest forecasts. The expected conditions today have spurred states to take safety measures as travel conditions continue to deteriorate. More than 500 flights scheduled for today have also been canceled, with Minneapolis and Denver each accounting for more than 100 cancellations, according to FlightAware. 3. Presidential race A number of Republicans have been making moves suggesting interest in a national presidential campaign and openly considering presidential bids. The primary field is early in its stages, but candidates are beginning to come forward -- and many more are expected in the coming months. The latest GOP hopeful to announce a run for the Republican presidential nomination is entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. He follows Nikki Haley, who became the first major rival to challenge former President Donald Trump when she announced her bid last week. Trump announced his third campaign for the White House last year. On the Democratic side, President Joe Biden has yet to officially state his reelection plans, but analysts say an announcement is coming soon. 4. Drug cartels Genaro García Luna, Mexico's former security minister, was found guilty in federal court Tuesday of taking bribes from the drug cartels he had sworn to combat, the US Attorney's Office said. The former Secretary of Public Security in Mexico served as his country's equivalent of the FBI director from 2006 to 2012. García Luna, who is the highest-ranking current or former Mexican official ever tried in the US, faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years in prison and a maximum of life behind bars. He will be sentenced in June. Jesus Ramirez Cuevas, a spokesperson for Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, praised the verdict on Twitter: ""The crimes against our people will never be forgotten."" 5. Avalanche Three climbers were killed in an avalanche while scaling an 8,000-foot peak in Washington state over the weekend, officials announced. A six-person group was attempting to climb a steep gorge on Colchuck Peak in the Cascade Mountains on Sunday when the avalanche happened, the Chelan County Sheriff's Office said. The three victims ranged in age from 53 to 66 and died after being swept down about 500 feet, according to officials. Their names have yet to be released. More than two dozen personnel have been involved in the rescue effort and local officials are urging people to be aware of the dangerous avalanche conditions before attempting this particular climb.

"Buttigieg says he'll visit East Palestine 'when the time is right,' lays out new rail safety efforts",2023-02-21,"Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg told reporters on Monday that he plans to visit East Palestine, Ohio, ""when the time is right"" and announced new efforts by his agency to improve rail safety in the wake of a train derailment that has left local residents questioning the safety of their soil, air and water. ""I am very interested in getting to know the residents of East Palestine, hearing from them about how they've been impacted and communicating with them about the steps that we're taking,"" Buttigieg said on a Monday call, adding that he had referred to past common practices of transportation secretaries by deferring first to the National Safety Transportation Board after a major disaster like the derailment. ""But yes, when the time is right, I do plan to visit East Palestine. I don't have a date for you right now."" Buttigieg said he ""could have spoken out sooner"" and that it was a ""lesson learned,"" in an interview Tuesday on CBS News' ""Red and Blue.""  ""I was focused on just making sure that our folks on the ground were all set but could have spoken sooner about how strongly I felt about this incident and that's a lesson learned for me,"" Buttigieg said.  Residents of the small community have criticized the response to the February 3 derailment of a Norfolk Southern train that released toxic chemicals. US Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan returned to East Palestine to meet with residents and local and state officials on Tuesday. Buttigieg previewed the new rail safety efforts in a recent letter to Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw, demanding accountability and calling for greater safety regulations. And while much of the Department of Transportation's newly announced efforts focus on calls to Congress and the private sector to work to bolster rail safety, he said his agency will enhance its work as well. ""We are accelerating and augmenting our ongoing lines of effort on rail regulation and inspection here at the US DOT, including further regulation on high hazard flammable trains and electronically controlled pneumatic brakes -- rules that were clawed back under the previous administration -- to the full extent of that we are allowed to under current law, and we will continue using resources from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to fund projects that improve rail safety,"" Buttigieg said. A DOT news release states that the agency will continue to press to advance the ""Train Crew Staffing Rule,"" which would require a minimum of two crew members during most railroad operations. Norfolk Southern has opposed the proposed rule.  Buttigieg also said that it's a good time to evaluate whether the federal government can ""expand the kinds of trains that count as high-hazard flammable train, so that there's a higher degree of safety."" ""Let me also mention, though, one of the things you'll see in the plan that I'm urging the railroads to do is not to wait on us to mandate this,"" he added. DOT is calling on Norfolk Southern and the rest of the freight rail and rail shipping industry to take a number of immediate actions, including committing to phasing in safer tank cars by 2025, the secretary said. The department is also calling on Congress to take up legislation that would increase the maximum fines DOT can issue to rail companies for violating safety regulations. On the call, the secretary repeatedly emphasized a new willingness from both sides of the aisle to address rail safety, saying, ""We're going to accelerate these actions and work, I hope, with the newfound bipartisan interest and support we've been seeing in Congress to secure stronger legislation and overcome resistance by the (railroad) industry to water down this lifesaving work."" Buttigieg said he would ""stay on the right side of the Hatch Act"" when he was asked about former President Donald Trump's upcoming visit to East Palestine, referencing a federal law that seeks to keep government functions nonpartisan. But he appeared to take issue with what he sees as political opportunists whose past policies may have encouraged the deregulation of the rail industry.   ""Whether we're talking about elected officials or anybody else showing up, there is a chance for everybody who has a public voice on this issue to demonstrate whether they are interested in helping the people of East Palestine or using the people of East Palestine,"" he said in response to the question about Trump, who has launched a 2024 White House bid.  ""This is a community that, through no fault of its own, is going through enormous upheaval. And a lot of the folks who seem to find political opportunity there are among those who have sided with the rail industry again and again and again, as they have fought safety regulations on railroads and hazmat, tooth and nail. And so, if people are going to find religion about rail regulation, sometimes for the first time, I welcome that."" The secretary also discussed Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio's recent statement questioning DOT on freight train system safety. ""We heard from Sen. Rubio last week, who had some pretty strong words about this incident,"" Buttigieg said. ""So, I guess what I would say is there is an opportunity right now, leaving aside the politics, for anyone on either side of the aisle to join us in raising the standard of accountability and safety. And if folks are serious about this -- Republican, Democrat or independent -- I will work with them to raise the bar.

Vivek Ramaswamy announces GOP bid for president in 2024,2023-02-22,"Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy announced on Tuesday that he's running for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination.  ""To put America first, we need to rediscover what America is. That's why I am running for president,"" Ramaswamy wrote in a Wall Street Journal editorial. ""I am launching not only a political campaign but a cultural movement to create a new American Dream—one that is not only about money but about the unapologetic pursuit of excellence."" Ramaswamy is a biotech and health care entrepreneur who has written two books, ""Nation of Victims: Identity Politics, the Death of Merit, and the Path Back to Excellence"" and ""Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America's Social Justice Scam."" The GOP primary field is still in its early stages. Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and United States ambassador to the United Nations, became the first major rival to challenge former President Donald Trump when she announced her bid last week. Trump announced his third campaign for the White House last year. A number of other Republicans have been making moves suggesting interest in a national campaign and openly considering presidential bids.  ""We embrace secular religions like climatism, Covidism and gender ideology to satisfy our need for meaning, yet we can't answer what it means to be an American,"" Ramaswamy wrote in the Journal. ""The Republican Party's top priority should be to fill this void with an inspiring national identity that dilutes the woke agenda to irrelevance,"" he continued. The editorial also called for securing the border, eliminating affirmative action and repealing civil service protection for federal employees. He filed a statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission earlier Tuesday and is scheduled to speak at a Polk County GOP event in Iowa on Thursday.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",13,96.0,0.0,0.9065,0.0935,0.7096,0.026,0.805,0.169,0.9927,9.2248,92.33377857142861,194.0,0.47594731222385883
"McCarthy gives Tucker Carlson access to January 6 Capitol security footage, sources say",2023-02-20,"House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has granted Fox News host Tucker Carlson access to all of the US Capitol security footage from January 6, multiple sources told CNN.  The highly unusual move -- a House speaker handing over a massive trove of internal government materials to a friendly media outlet -- comes after the California Republican faced significant pressure from his right flank to relitigate the work of the House select committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, insurrection. During his bid for the speakership, McCarthy vowed to hold hearings on the security failures that led to the Capitol getting overrun, and he told the select committee to preserve all of its records for potential future review by the newly empowered GOP majority. Carlson has been one of the most prominent promoters of January 6 conspiracy theories. Most notably, he has devoted significant airtime to the false claim that liberal ""deep state"" partisans within the FBI orchestrated the insurrection as a way to undermine former President Donald Trump. He has conducted sympathetic interviews with some of the rioters who were subsequently charged by the Justice Department. Several GOP lawmakers within McCarthy's ranks had hoped to review the material themselves, likely to hunt for footage that supports their controversial claims about the January 6 insurrection. By giving the videos to Carlson, McCarthy is essentially outsourcing the task to right-wing media, at least for the moment. Axios was first to report McCarthy's arrangement with Carlson. US Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger confirmed in a statement to CNN that Capitol Police gave McCarthy the security footage from the Capitol attack to be released to Carlson. ""When congressional leadership or congressional oversight committees ask for things like this, we must give it to them,"" Manger said in a statement. Capitol Police cannot comment further ""because we have to stay out of politics,"" a department official told CNN. A Fox News spokesperson told CNN that the Axios report was accurate, but declined further comment. Carlson told Axios, ""there was never any legitimate reason for this footage to remain secret"" and that the videos will shed light on ""what actually happened on January 6.""  House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, the chamber's top Democrat, was not consulted about the release of the security footage, a source familiar told CNN. Another source told CNN that McCarthy didn't consult with his GOP leadership team before making the decision. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Sergeant at Arms Karen Gibson only learned that McCarthy had granted Carlson access when the news became public, a source familiar with the timeline told CNN.  Manger, the Capitol Police chief, did not know that McCarthy was giving Carlson access to the footage until Monday, which was after the arrangement had been made, the source said. The source explained that McCarthy, or any member of Congress, could request access to the footage and that USCP would generally grant it. A separate source told CNN that if McCarthy asked the Capitol Police for the footage, he would not have to state why he wanted it in order to receive it.  The now-defunct January 6 committee got access to all the security footage from US Capitol Police during its investigation, but did not release certain clips for security reasons. A source familiar with the panel's work told CNN that the unreleased footage was considered especially sensitive because it showed the movements of top officials while they evacuated to safety. Separately, the House Committee on Administration made a request for the security footage, another source familiar told CNN. The panel, which was tasked with taking custody of all January 6 select committee documents, per House rules, requested the same access to the footage that the select committee had, the source said. Pushback to the move   House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, issued a letter to his colleagues Tuesday vowing to get to the bottom of how McCarthy transferred footage of the attack to Carlson's team. ""The apparent transfer of video footage represents an egregious security breach that endangers the hardworking women and men of the United States Capitol Police, who valiantly defended our democracy with their lives at risk on that fateful day,"" Jeffries wrote in the letter.  Tim Mulvey, a former January 6 committee spokesman, blasted McCarthy's move in a statement to CNN, saying, ""It's hard to overstate the potential security risks if this material were used irresponsibly"" by Carlson or others. ""When the January 6th Select Committee obtained access to US Capitol Police video footage, it was treated with great sensitivity given concerns about the security of lawmakers, staff, and the Capitol complex,"" Mulvey said. ""Access was limited to members and a small handful of investigators and senior staff, and the public use of any footage was coordinated in advance with Capitol Police."" Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the ranking member on the Homeland Security Committee and former chair of the January 6 committee, later added in a statement that McCarthy, if he ""indeed granted"" Carlson access, ""owes the American people an explanation of why he has done so and what steps he has taken to address the significant security concerns at stake."" When asked at a press conference last month about how some Republicans previously urged former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to publicly release the full January 6 security footage, McCarthy signaled his support, saying, ""yeah, I think the public should see what happened."" In the courtroom, federal prosecutors have long tried to keep certain CCTV clips from the Capitol complex hidden from the public, saying in court that their release poses a national security risk and could give vital insight to bad actors who may be planning a future attack. US Capitol Police share the same concerns. January 6 defendants have access to thousands of hours of unreleased footage from the attack, as well from an online database, but the videos are tightly controlled by a protective order and defendants are not allowed to publicly release the clips. ""Once the capabilities of a U.S. Capitol interior surveillance camera, including its position and whether it pans, tilts or zooms, is disclosed to the public via the release of a single video from that camera, the cat is out of the bag,"" Justice Department prosecutors wrote in a July 2021 court filing. After more than a dozen news outlets, including CNN, sued for access to the videos in 2021, the chief judge of DC federal court ruled that the public has a strong interest in seeing some security footage from the attack. However, these video releases haven't been automatic or guaranteed. News outlets can request the public release of videos after they are played in open court, on a case-by-case basis. Former DC Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone, who was attacked during the January 6 riot, called McCarthy's decision to give Carlson access to security footage from that day a ""dangerous choice."" It ""guarantees that it will be selectively edited to fit an extreme MAGA narrative without care for the safety of Capitol police, members of Congress and congressional staff. Airing footage of restricted areas of the Capitol and sensitive evacuation protocols all while spreading misinformation about the nature of the attack on the Capitol endangers everyone working in the building,"" Fanone, who is now a CNN contributor, said in a statement to CNN.

Trump leadership PAC spent more than $16 million on legal services in 2022,2023-02-22,"Donald Trump's leadership PAC spent more than $16 million on legal services in 2022, according to a tally of the Save America PAC distributions through the end of December. The number represents a massive set of bills from lawyers at a time when the former president faces multiple criminal inquiries, lawsuits and other challenges. The money appears to be largely geared toward firms representing Trump and his business and family interests. The disbursements show that Save America PAC paid more than $12.5 million to 16 law firms that have aided in his representation, either in the criminal matters or other legal disputes, according to CNN's review of the data and additional reporting. Some of those law firms also represent others who've been sought out as subjects in the inquiries around Trump. The firm of a Trump defense attorney, Alina Habba, took in nearly $2 million from Save America in 2022. Habba Madaio & Associates has represented him opposite a New York State attorney general probe and in other lawsuits.  Another firm, van der Veen, Hartshorn and Levin, which has lawyers who represented Trump in his 2021 impeachment proceedings and also represented a Trump Organization entity in New York, was paid $1.4 million, according to federal election records. And the two law firms of Trump's primary criminal defense attorneys, Evan Corcoran and James Trusty, were each paid $1.2 million, Save America PAC reported. Some law firms receiving Save America's payments represent close contacts of Trump's, such as McGuireWoods, which represents his former chief of staff Mark Meadows. The large law firms McGuireWoods and Squire Patton Boggs, which represents former Trump White House speechwriter staffers, received almost $900,000 and $250,000, respectively, while several smaller law firms that represent key witnesses in ongoing investigations received payments into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. In all, nearly 30 law firms received at least $100,000 from Save America PAC.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.889, 'pos': 0.111, 'compound': 0.128}",11,98.0,0.018375,0.880875,0.100875,0.4458,0.046,0.846,0.108,0.9432,4.9037999999999995,49.854400000000034,139.0,0.35866474820143907
Opinion: What it means to stand behind Vladimir Putin,2023-02-21,"One year into Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Vladimir Putin is more dangerous than ever. The Russian dictator marked the anniversary of his unprovoked aggression -- which has killed or wounded close to 200,000 of Russia's own soldiers and turned some 16 million Ukrainians into refugees -- by suspending Russia's participation in a key nuclear arms deal that kept the threat of nuclear war at bay and giving a 100-minute speech to the country on Tuesday blaming Ukraine and its supporters for the war Putin started.    In emphasizing his vision of a conservative, traditional and patriarchal Russia at war with a more libertine West, Putin's speech drew directly from the strongman's playbook: Deflect blame, lie to suit your own interests, lean into a reactionary and hateful form of masculinity to get the crowds cheering.  It would be something of a pathetic showing if this particular strongman didn't happen to have control of the largest nuclear arsenal in the world.  The nuclear agreement that Putin suspended, called New START, limited the number of nuclear missiles that both the US and Russia could have deployed and gave both nations the right to inspect each other's nuclear sites. With Putin's move to suspend his nation's participation in the program, the last remaining nuclear deal between the two nations is effectively dead and we have returned to a dangerous era of nuclear dysregulation. Putin's decision is indeed ""deeply unfortunate and irresponsible,"" as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken put it.  Other experts were starker in their assessments. ""This is more about nuclear blackmail, but it is extremely dangerous,"" Andrei Kolesnikov of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace told the BBC, ""because we cannot predict how Putin will behave in the future and what is in his mind.""  For Americans who came of age after the end of the Cold War, this renewed threat of nuclear annihilation is both new and terrifying; for those who lived through the original Cold War, this is no doubt a hair-raising reboot.  But it's not just about a renewed nuclear threat. In Poland after an historic wartime visit to Kyiv, US President Joe Biden gave a speech of his own, also highlighting a fundamental divide -- not between conservative religiosity and liberal tolerance, as Putin put it, but between autocracy and democracy. ""The democracies of the world have grown stronger, not weaker,"" Biden said. ""But the autocrats of the world have grown weaker, not stronger.""   He continued: ""That's what's at stake here: Freedom."" Biden is correct that this is indeed a battle between freedom and oppression. It's worth nothing, though, that Putin's emphasis on cultural and gender warfare is also correct, in its own way.  He is of course lying and fear-mongering when he fulminates about same-sex marriage or the prospect of a gender-neutral God and when he says that the West seeks ""the destruction of the family, cultural and national identity, perversion and the abuse of children are declared the norm."" It is true, though, that there is a clear historical and contemporary relationship between conservative religiosity and autocracy on the one hand, and liberal tolerance and democracy on the other.  Conservative religiosity is of course not a requirement for autocracy -- just look at the previous era of Russian autocracy, which was decidedly irreligious. And the autocrats in Beijing, who are expanding their own nuclear arsenals and toying with lending material support to Russia, are not exactly bringing conservative Christian principles to China.  But they are embracing traditionalism, hypermasculinity and a backward-looking national identity. Among analysists of global authoritarians, a familiar refrain has emerged: Make [x country] Great Again. Xi Jinping is trying to make China great again, writes the New Yorker's Evan Osnos. ""Putin set out to 'Make Russia Great Again,'"" Gen. David Petraeus told CNN earlier this month. And, of course, we all know the American version.  In his speech, Biden took great pains to emphasize that the villain here is Putin, not Russians writ large; while Biden did frame the battle as one between freedom and totalitarianism, he did not feed into Putin's claims that this is a war between Western liberalism and Russian traditionalism.    It's informative, though (and scary) to realize the extent to which a number of right-wing Americans believe Putin has a point about the West being degenerate, and seem comfortable bringing a strongman in to restore the traditional order.  The most salient divide is not between East and West; it's between those who want pluralistic liberal democracies that allow people to live freely no matter what their religious beliefs, sexual orientations and aspirations -- and those who prefer autocratic strongmen who use the law to impose conservative, traditional values whether people like it or not.  Former US President Donald Trump notoriously praised Putin and trashed NATO, elevating the dictator's status among pro-Trump conservatives. As of a year ago, Republicans in the US had a more favorable view of Putin than of Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic Party.  Tucker Carlson has used his influential spot on Fox News to spout pro-Putin propaganda. Newly-elected Sen. JD Vance of Ohio has said, ""I don't really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another,"" while former Trump economic advisor Peter Navarro has declared Ukraine ""not really a country,"" and former Trump Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has praised Putin by saying, ""I have enormous respect for him.""  Meanwhile, Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene claimed that ""NATO has been supplying the neo-Nazis in Ukraine with powerful weapons and extensive training on how to use them.""  On the campaign trail in November she pledged that ""Under Republicans, not another penny will go to Ukraine."" Nick Fuentes, the white nationalist who recently dined with Trump and rapper Kanye West at Mar-a-Lago, told his followers, ""I wish Putin was president of America."" Andrew Torba, the CEO of the right-wing platform Gab, put the issue in even starker terms last year: ""What (Putin) really means is Ukraine needs to be liberated and cleansed from the degeneracy of the secular western globalist empire."" Putin has positioned his Russia as the leading light for Christian nationalists worldwide, standing against Western secularism and decadence. And many Christian nationalists, including in the United States, have gotten in line.   This is not just a divide between Russia and the US. It's a divide within Russia itself, as the nation's feminists, LGBTQ rights advocates, and democracy activists continue to push (often at great personal risk) for a freer and fairer country. And it's a divide within the US, too, between the Americans who want liberal democracy to thrive, and those who want their ideology to rule us all.  A year into Putin's war, it's clear that he is willing to sacrifice untold lives to cement his power and Russia's imperial interests. Americans have a choice, both at home and abroad: Do we stand with autocrats and their small, hateful view of the world? Or do we stand for freedom and democracy -- including the obligation to live among those whose views you don't agree with and whose choices you wouldn't make yourself?  The decision, and the stakes, couldn't be clearer.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",46,99.0,0.016333333333333335,0.8626666666666667,0.121,0.4770666666666667,0.106,0.765,0.129,0.9837,21.94506666666667,71.2054666666667,141.0,0.5050033096926716
"Nikki Haley defended right to secession, Confederate History Month and the Confederate flag in 2010 talk",2023-02-21,"Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley defended states' rights to secede from the United States, South Carolina's Confederate History Month and the Confederate flag in a 2010 interview with a local activist group that ""fights attacks against Southern Culture.""   Haley, who was running for South Carolina governor at the time, made the comments during an interview with the now defunct ""The Palmetto Patriots,"" a group which included a one-time board member of a White nationalist organization.   The former UN ambassador also described the Civil War as two sides fighting for different values, one for ""tradition"" and one for ""change.""  Haley announced last week she was running for president, becoming the first official major challenger to former President Donald Trump.   The interview was posted on the group's YouTube at the time and resurfaced over the years, most recently by Patriots Takes, an anonymous Twitter account that monitors right wing extremism. CNN's KFile reviewed the interviews as part of a look into Haley's early political career.  One of the Palmetto Patriots' interviewers was Robert Slimp, a pastor and member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans and one-time board member and active member of the Council of Conservative Citizens (CCC), a White nationalist group. The CCC is a self-described White-rights group that opposes non-White immigration and advocates a White nationalist ideology. The group reportedly inspired Charleston shooter Dylann Roof, the White nationalist who killed nine people at a historically Black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015.  The shooting spurred Haley, then governor, to call for the removal of the Confederate battle flag from the South Carolina statehouse grounds where it had been since being removed from the state's Capitol dome in 2000.  In a comment to CNN, Haley's spokesperson cited her decision to help remove the flag from the grounds but declined to address Haley's other comments.  ""Nikki Haley's groundbreaking leadership on removing the Confederate flag from the South Carolina Capitol grounds is well known,"" Ken Farnaso, her spokesperson, wrote in an email to CNN.  Defends the flag  In the 2010 interview, Haley said the Confederate flag was not ""racist"" but part of heritage and tradition within the state. She called the flag's location a ""compromise of all people, that everybody should accept a part of South Carolina.""  ""You know, for those groups that come in and say they have issues with the Confederate flag, I will work to talk to them about it,"" Haley said. ""I will work and talk to them about the heritage and how this is not something that is racist. This is something that is a tradition that people feel proud of and let them know that we want their business in this state. And that the flag where it is, was a compromise of all people that everybody should accept as part of South Carolina.""  After the Charleston church mass shooting, Haley called on the state legislature to remove the Confederate flag from the state capitol, becoming one of the defining moments of her governorship.   ""There is a place for that flag,"" Haley said to CNN in July 2015 after the flag was removed. ""It's not in a place that represents all people in South Carolina.""  But Haley's later comments would complicate this legacy after she claimed that to some people the Confederate flag symbolized ""service, sacrifice and heritage"" for some South Carolinians until Roof ""hijacked"" it, sparking backlash.   Following the backlash, Haley wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post defending her comments.  ""In South Carolina, as in much of the South, the Confederate flag has long been a hot-button issue,"" Haley wrote. ""Everyone knows the flag has always been a symbol of slavery, discrimination and hate for many people. But not everyone sees the flag that way. That's hard for non-Southerners to understand, but it's a fact.""  Defended the right to secession  When asked about secession, Haley said that while she believed under the Constitution that states have the right to secede from the rest of the country. When asked if she would support the seccession of South Carolina, which was the first state to secede during the Civil War, she said she did not think ""it's gonna get to that point.""  ""The Union, I think that they do,"" Haley inaccurately said. ""I mean, the Constitution says that.""  The Supreme Court ruled in 1869 that states do not have a constitutional right to unilaterally secede.  Haley declined to say if she would support South Carolina if it ""needed"" to secede, when asked.     ""You know, I'm one of those people that doesn't think it's gonna get to that point,"" Haley said before describing how she might rally governors to go to the federal government to settle disputes over ""federal intrusion.""  Defends Confederate Heritage Month  Haley also said she supported South Carolina's ""Confederate History Month"" during the interview, comparing it to Black History Month.  ""Yes, it's part of a traditional -- you know, it's part of tradition,"" she said. ""And so, when you look at that, if you have the same as you have Black History Month and you have Confederate History Month and all of those. As long as it's done where it is in a positive way and not in a negative way, and it doesn't go to harm anyone, and it goes back to where it focuses on the traditions of the people that are wanting to celebrate it, then I think it's fine.  Calls the Civil War a fight for 'tradition v. change'  In her interview, Haley also described the Civil War in terms sympathetic to the southern cause and did not mention slavery.   ""I mean, again, I think that as we look in government, as we watch government, you have different sides, and I think that you see passions on different sides, and I don't think anyone does anything out of hate,"" Haley said. ""I think what they do is, they do things out of tradition and out of beliefs of what they believe is right.""   ""I think you have one side of the Civil War that was fighting for tradition, and I think you have another side of the Civil War that was fighting for change,"" she added. ""You know, at the end of the day, what I think we need to remember is that you know, everyone is supposed to have their rights, everyone is supposed to be free, everyone is supposed to have the same freedoms as anyone else. So, you know I think it was tradition versus change is the way I see it.  ""Tradition versus change on what,"" asked the interviewer.  ""On individual rights and liberty of people,"" she responded.  Haley later added she believed everyone was endowed with rights from ""our creator"" to ""life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.""  ""Well, I think that for me, you know what I continue to remember is that you know we also know that our creator endowed the rights of everyone having you know, life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,"" she said. 'And so, when I look at it that way, I look at that's still what needs to be what guides everybody, so that we make sure that we keep those three things in check.""

Supreme Court hears Gonzalez v. Google case against Big Tech,2023-02-20,"Supreme Court justices appeared broadly concerned Tuesday about the potential unintended consequences of allowing websites to be sued for their automatic recommendations of user content, highlighting the challenges facing attorneys that want to hold Google accountable for suggesting YouTube videos created by terrorist groups.  For nearly three hours, the nine justices peppered attorneys representing Google, the US government and the family of Nohemi Gonzalez, an American student killed in a 2015 ISIS attack in Paris, with questions about how the court could design a ruling that exposes harmful content recommendations to liability while still protecting innocuous ones.  How – or if – the court draws that line could have significant implications for the way websites choose to rank, display and promote content to their users as they seek to avoid a litigation minefield.  The attorney for the Gonzalez family argued that narrowing Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act — the federal law protecting websites’ right to moderate their platforms as they see fit — would not lead to sweeping consequences for the internet. But both the court’s liberals and conservatives worried about the impact of such a decision on everything from “pilaf [recipes] from Uzbekistan” to individual users of YouTube, Twitter and other social media platforms.  Justices are worried about a wave of lawsuits and disruption to the internet: A big concern of the justices seems to be the waves of lawsuits that could happen if the court rules against Google.  ""Lawsuits will be nonstop,"" Justice Brett Kavanaugh said at one point.  But Eric Schnapper, representing the plaintiffs, argued a ruling for Gonzalez would not have far-reaching effects because even if websites could face new liability as a result of the ruling, most suits would likely be thrown out anyway.  ""The implications are limited,"" Schnapper said, ""because the kinds of circumstance in which a recommendation would be actionable are limited.""  Later, Justice Elena Kagan warned that narrowing Section 230 could lead to a wave of lawsuits, even if many of them would eventually be thrown out, in a line of questioning with US Deputy Solicitor General Malcolm Stewart.  ""You are creating a world of lawsuits,"" Kagan said. ""Really, anytime you have content, you also have these presentational and prioritization choices that can be subject to suit.""   Chief Justice John Roberts mused that under a narrowed version of Section 230, terrorism-related cases might only be a small share of a much wider range of future lawsuits against websites alleging antitrust violations, discrimination, defamation and infliction of emotional distress, just to name a few.   Read more takeaways here and watch CNN's Jessica Schneider break down the case: Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson questioned Lisa Blatt about Congress' original intent in passing Section 230, suggesting that the law was never meant to insulate tech platforms from lawsuits linked to algorithmic content recommendations.  ""Isn’t it true that the statute had a more narrow scope of immunity than courts have ultimately interpreted it to have, and that it was really just about making sure that your platform and other platforms weren’t disincentivized to block and screen and remove offensive content?"" Jackson asked, adding that recommendations were ""not something the statute was directed to."" Blatt, who is representing Google in the case, disputed Jackson's narrative, saying lawsuits pertaining to recommendations fell within the scope of the authors' legislative intent to shield websites from a barrage of websites. ""That’s death by a thousand cuts, and the internet would’ve never gotten off the ground if anybody could sue at any time and it were left up to 50 states’ liability regimes,"" Blatt said. The original authors of Section 230, Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden and former California Republican Rep. Chris Cox, explained their thinking behind the legislation in a filing to the court.  ""Congress drafted Section 230 in a technology-neutral manner that would enable the provision to apply to subsequently developed methods of presenting and moderating user-generated content,"" Wyden and Cox wrote. ""The targeted recommendations at issue in this case are an example of a more contemporary method of content presentation."" Algorithmic recommendations, they added, are ""direct descendants of the early content curation efforts that Congress had in mind when enacting Section 230. And because Section 230 is agnostic as to the underlying technology used by the online platform, a platform is eligible for immunity under Section 230 for its targeted recommendations to the same extent as any other content presentation or moderation activities."" So while Jackson is correct that Section 230 has been interpreted expansively by the courts, the intent of Section 230 is more in line with Blatt's reading than Jackson's, according to the drafters of the original law. Lisa Blatt, a well-known Supreme Court advocate who is representing Google in this case, is up for questioning. The hearing has been underway for nearly two hours. ""Section 230 C1's 26 words created today's internet,"" Blatt said, kicking off her presentation before the Supreme Court justices.  Here is what the text says:  “No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.” A big concern of justices seems to be what happens if the court rules against Google, namely a wave of lawsuits. Justice Brett Kavanaugh asked Eric Schnapper, representing the plantiffs, to respond to various friend-of-the-court briefs warning of widespread disruption. ""We have a lot of amicus briefs that we have to take seriously that say this is going to cause"" significant disruption, Kavanaugh said.  Schnapper argued that a ruling for Gonzalez would not have far-reaching effects because even if websites could face new liability as a result of the ruling, most suits would likely be thrown out anyway. ""The implications are limited,"" Schnapper argued, ""because the kinds of circumstance in which a recommendation would be actionable are limited."" Many of the briefs Kavanaugh referenced had expressed fears of a deluge of litigation that could overwhelm startups and small businesses, whether or not they held any merit.  Later, Justice Elena Kagan warned that narrowing Section 230 could lead to a wave of lawsuits, even if many of them would eventually be thrown out, in a line of questioning with US Deputy Solicitor General Malcolm Stewart.  ""You are creating a world of lawsuits,"" Kagan said. ""Really, anytime you have content, you also have these presentational and prioritization choices that can be subject to suit.""  Even as Stewart suggested many such lawsuits might not ultimately lead to anything, Justices Kavanaugh and Roberts appeared to take issue with the potential rise in lawsuits in the first place. ""Lawsuits will be nonstop,"" Kavanaugh said.   Chief Justice John Roberts mused that under a narrowed version of Section 230, terrorism-related cases might only be a small share of a much wider range of future lawsuits against websites alleging antitrust violations, discrimination, defamation and infliction of emotional distress, just to name a few.  ""I wouldn't necessarily agree with 'there would be lots of lawsuits' simply because there are a lot of things to sue about, but they would not be suits that have much likelihood of prevailing, especially if the court makes clear that even after there's a recommendation, the website still can't be treated as the publisher or speaker of the underlying third party,"" Stewart said. Congress, the White House and now the US Supreme Court are all focusing their attention on a federal law that’s long served as a legal shield for online platforms. The Supreme Court is hearing oral arguments on two pivotal cases this week dealing with online speech and content moderation. Central to the arguments is Section 230, a federal law that’s been roundly criticized by both Republicans and Democrats for different reasons but that tech companies and digital rights groups have defended as vital to a functioning internet. In today's oral arguments on Gonzalez v. Google, the law has already come up multiple times.  Tech companies involved in the litigation have cited the 27-year-old statute as part of an argument for why they shouldn’t have to face lawsuits alleging they gave knowing, substantial assistance to terrorist acts by hosting or algorithmically recommending terrorist content. Here are key things to know about the law:  Passed in 1996 during the early days of the World Wide Web, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act was meant to nurture startups and entrepreneurs. The legislation’s text recognized the internet was in its infancy and risked being choked out of existence if website owners could be sued for things other people posted.
Under Section 230, websites enjoy immunity for moderating content in the ways they see fit — not according to others’ preferences — although the federal government can still sue platforms for violating criminal or intellectual property laws.
Contrary to what some politicians have claimed, Section 230’s protections do not hinge on a platform being politically or ideologically neutral. The law also does not require that a website be classified as a publisher in order to “qualify” for liability protection. Apart from meeting the definition of an “interactive computer service,” websites need not do anything to gain Section 230’s benefits – they apply automatically.
The law’s central provision holds that websites (and their users) cannot be treated legally as the publishers or speakers of other people’s content. In plain English, that means any legal responsibility attached to publishing a given piece of content ends with the person or entity that created it, not the platforms on which the content is shared or the users who re-share it.
The seemingly simple language of Section 230 belies its sweeping impact. Courts have repeatedly accepted Section 230 as a defense against claims of defamation, negligence and other allegations. In the past, it’s protected AOL, Craigslist, Google and Yahoo, building up a body of law so broad and influential as to be considered a pillar of today’s internet. In recent years, however, critics of Section 230 have increasingly questioned the law’s scope and proposed restrictions on the circumstances in which websites may invoke the legal shield. Read more about Section 230 here.   Under questioning by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, attorney Eric Schnapper, representing the plaintiffs in Gonzalez v. Google, confirmed that under the legal theory he is advancing, Section 230 would not protect individual internet users retweeting, sharing or liking other people's content.  The text of Section 230 explicitly immunizes ""users"" from liability for the content posted by third parties, not just social media platforms. Barrett asked Schnapper whether giving a ""thumbs-up"" to another user's posts, or whether taking actions including ""like, retweet, or say 'check this out,'"" means that she has ""created new content"" and thus lost Section 230's protections.  After quibbling briefly with Barrett over the definition of a user, Schnapper acknowledged that the act of liking or retweeting is an act of content creation that should expose the person liking or retweeting to potential liability.  ""On your theory, I’m not protected by 230?"" Barrett asked. ""That's content you've created,"" Schnapper replied. Malcolm Stewart, the US deputy solicitor general, is now up for arguments.  The Justice Department is arguing that Section 230's protections for platforms should be read more broadly than what that the plaintiffs are arguing, but that the algorithms that platforms use to make recommendations could potentially open up tech companies for liability. Justice Amy Coney Barrett referenced the exit ramp the Supreme Court has that would allow it to avoid the big legal question over the scope of Section 230, the relevant law the gives internet platforms certain protections from legal liability. She pointed to the tech case the court will hear Wednesday, in which the justices will consider whether an anti-terrorism law covers internet platforms for their failure to adequate remove terrorism-related conduct. The same law is being used by the plaintiffs to sue Google in Tuesday's case. ""So if you lose tomorrow, do we even have to reach the section 230 question here? Would you concede that you would lose on that ground here?,"" Justice Barrett asked Eric Schnapper, the attorney for those who have sued Google. Justice Elena Kagan hinted that she thought that even if the arguments against Google had merits as a policy matter, Congress — rather than the Supreme Court — should be the one that steps in. ""I could imagine a world where you’re right, that none of this stuff gets protection. And you know — every other industry has to internalize the costs of its conduct. Why is it that the tech industry gets a pass? A little bit unclear,"" Kagan said.  On the other hand — we’re a court. We really don’t know about these sorts of things. These are not, like, the nine greatest experts on the internet,"" she said.  Following laughter in the courtroom, Kagan said she didn't have to accept ""the sky is falling"" arguments from Google's lawyers to think this was difficult and uncertain waters for the judicial branch to be wading in. Maybe Congress wants a system that Google isn't so broadly protected, she offered: ""But isn't that something for Congress to do? Not the court?"" Those who sued Google do not appear to be getting a lot of sympathy from the justices.  Across ideological lines, the justices seemed to struggle with even the basics of the arguments the plaintiffs are trying make.  Questioning attorney Eric Schnapper first, Justice Clarence Thomas zeroed in on the fact that the algorithm that the plaintiffs are targeting in their case operates in the same way for ISIS videos as it does for cooking videos.  “I think you're going to have to explain more clearly, if it's neutral in that way, how your claim is set apart from that,” Thomas said.  Later on in the argument, Thomas grilled Schnapper on how a neutral algorithm could amount to aiding and abetting under the relevant anti-terrorism law. He equated it to calling information, asking for Abu Dhabi's phone number, and getting it from them. ""I don't see how that's aiding and abetting,"" he said. Liberal justices seemed just as wary of the idea that the algorithm could really make a platform liable for aiding and abetting terrorism.  “I guess the question is how you get yourself from a neutral algorithm to an aiding and abetting – an intent, knowledge,” said Justice Sonia Sotomayor. “There has to be some intent to aid and abet. You have to knowledge that you’re doing this.”  Eric Schnapper, the attorney for those who have sued Google, seems to be having difficulty articulating what aspect of YouTube's business should be exposed to liability.  Across numerous questions, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas and Elena Kagan, among others, have expressed confusion about how they can prevent a Supreme Court ruling from unintentionally harming content recommendations related to innocuous content, such as rice pilaf recipes. Schnapper appears reluctant to acknowledge that a ruling in his favor could have wide-ranging implications for content beyond videos posted by ISIS. ""I'm trying to get you to explain to us how something that is standard on YouTube for virtually anything you have an interest in, suddenly amounts to aiding and abetting [terrorism] because you're [viewing] in the ISIS category,"" Thomas said.  Justice Samuel Alito put it more bluntly: ""I admit I'm completely confused by whatever argument you're making at the present time."" Justice Clarence Thomas jumps in with the first question of the Gonzalez v. Google hearing, asking Eric Schnapper, the attorney for those who have sued Google, about whether there was something specific about YouTube's algorithm for the pro-ISIS videos in question that make the platform liable in his clients' lawsuit. ""So we're clear about what ... your claim is: Are you saying that YouTube's application of its algorithm is particular to, in this case — that they're using a different algorithm to the one that, say, they're using for cooking videos? Or are they using the same algorithm across the board?""  Thomas, who at one time had a reputation for rarely speaking at oral arguments, was expected to be highly engaged in this case.  While most justices have not previously weighed in on the particular legal issue in this case, Thomas has signaled that he thinks that the statutory provision in question was being interpreted too broadly by lower courts. The Supreme Court is hearing oral arguments in the first of two cases this week with the potential to reshape how online platforms handle speech and content moderation. The oral arguments on Tuesday are for a case known as Gonzalez v. Google, which zeroes in on whether the tech giant can be sued because of its subsidiary YouTube’s algorithmic promotion of terrorist videos on its platform. According to the plaintiffs in the case — the family of Nohemi Gonzalez, who was killed in a 2015 ISIS attack in Paris — YouTube’s targeted recommendations violated a US antiterrorism law by helping to radicalize viewers and promote ISIS’s worldview. The allegation seeks to carve out content recommendations so that they do not receive protections under Section 230, a federal law that has for decades largely protected websites from lawsuits over user-generated content. If successful, it could expose tech platforms to an array of new lawsuits and may reshape how social media companies run their services. What tech companies are saying: Google and other tech companies have said that exempting targeted recommendations from Section 230 immunity would increase the legal risks associated with ranking, sorting and curating online content, a basic feature of the modern internet. Google has claimed that in such a scenario, websites would seek to play it safe by either removing far more content than is necessary, or by giving up on content moderation altogether and allowing even more harmful material on their platforms. As we wait for oral arguments to begin, here's what we know about how the day will unfold. Eric Schnapper, an attorney representing the Gonzalez family, will kick things off. Schnapper will have 20 minutes to speak, although realistically the argument could run longer.  Next, Malcolm Stewart will speak on behalf of the US government, which has argued that Section 230 should not protect a website's targeted recommendations of content. Stewart is budgeted for 15 minutes. Google's attorney Lisa Blatt will follow for about 35 minutes, and then Schnapper will have a chance to offer concluding remarks — though, again, everything today could run for much longer than anticipated.  Justice Neil Gorsuch is under the weather and will participate in oral arguments in Gonzalez v. Google remotely, according to the Supreme Court. The court did not specify the type of illness.  During the Covid-19 pandemic, oral arguments were conducted remotely.  The Supreme Court is set to hear back-to-back oral arguments Tuesday and Wednesday on two cases that could significantly reshape online speech and content moderation. The outcome of the oral arguments could determine whether tech platforms and social media companies can be sued for recommending content to their users or for supporting acts of international terrorism by hosting terrorist content. It marks the SCOTUS' first-ever review of a hot-button federal law that largely protects websites from lawsuits over user-generated content. First up Tuesday is the Gonzalez v. Google case. At the heart of the legal battle is Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a nearly 30-year-old federal law that courts have repeatedly said provide broad protections to tech platforms but has since come under scrutiny alongside growing criticism of Big Tech’s content moderation decisions. The case involving Google zeroes in on whether it can be sued because of its subsidiary YouTube’s algorithmic promotion of terrorist videos on its platform. According to the plaintiffs in the case — the family of Nohemi Gonzalez, who was killed in a 2015 ISIS attack in Paris — YouTube’s targeted recommendations violated a US antiterrorism law by helping to radicalize viewers and promote ISIS’s worldview. The allegation seeks to carve out content recommendations so that they do not receive protections under Section 230, potentially exposing tech platforms to more liability for how they run their services. Google and other tech companies have said that interpretation of Section 230 would increase the legal risks associated with ranking, sorting and curating online content, a basic feature of the modern internet. Google has claimed that in such a scenario, websites would seek to play it safe by either removing far more content than is necessary, or by giving up on content moderation altogether and allowing even more harmful material on their platforms. Friend-of-the-court filings by Craigslist, Microsoft, Yelp and others have suggested the stakes are not limited to algorithms and could also end up affecting virtually anything on the web that might be construed as making a recommendation. That might mean even average internet users who volunteer as moderators on various sites could face legal risks, according to a filing by Reddit and several volunteer Reddit moderators. Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden and former California Republican Rep. Chris Cox — the original co-authors of Section 230 — argued to the court that Congress’ intent in passing the law was to give websites broad discretion to moderate content as they saw fit. The Biden administration has also weighed in on the case. In a brief filed in December, it argued Section 230 does protect Google and YouTube from lawsuits “for failing to remove third-party content, including the content it has recommended.” But, the government’s brief argued, those protections do not extend to Google’s algorithms because they represent the company’s own speech, not that of others. The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments Wednesday on the second case, Twitter v. Taamneh, which will decide whether social media companies can be sued for aiding and abetting a specific act of international terrorism when the platforms have hosted user content that expresses general support for the group behind the violence without referring to the specific terrorist act in question. Rulings in the cases are expected by the end of June. The deadlock over Section 230 has thrown much of the momentum for changing the law to the courts — most notably, the US Supreme Court, which now has an opportunity this term to dictate how far the law extends. Tech critics have called for added legal exposure and accountability.  “The massive social media industry has grown up largely shielded from the courts and the normal development of a body of law. It is highly irregular for a global industry that wields staggering influence to be protected from judicial inquiry,” the Anti-Defamation League wrote in a Supreme Court brief. For the tech giants, and even for many of Big Tech’s fiercest competitors, it would be a bad thing, because it would undermine what has allowed the internet to flourish. It would potentially put many websites and users into unwitting and abrupt legal jeopardy, they say, and it would dramatically change how some websites operate in order to avoid liability. The social media platform Reddit argued in a Supreme Court brief that if Section 230 is narrowed so its protections do not cover a site’s recommendations of content a user might enjoy, that would “dramatically expand Internet users’ potential to be sued for their online interactions.” “‘Recommendations’ are the very thing that make Reddit a vibrant place,” wrote the company and several volunteer Reddit moderators. “It is users who upvote and downvote content, and thereby determine which posts gain prominence and which fade into obscurity.” People would stop using Reddit, and moderators would stop volunteering, the brief argued, under a legal regime that “carries a serious risk of being sued for ‘recommending’ a defamatory or otherwise tortious post that was created by someone else.” While this week’s oral arguments won’t be the end of the debate over Section 230, the outcome of the cases could lead to hugely significant changes the internet has never before seen — for better or for worse. Much of the criticism of Section 230 has come from conservatives who say that the law lets social media platforms suppress right-leaning views for political reasons. By safeguarding platforms’ freedom to moderate content as they see fit, Section 230 does shield websites from lawsuits that might arise from that type of viewpoint-based content moderation, though social media companies have said they do not make content decisions based on ideology, but rather on violations of their policies. The Trump administration tried to turn some of those criticisms into concrete policy that would have had significant consequences, if it had succeeded. For example, in 2020, the Justice Department released a legislative proposal for changes to Section 230 that would create an eligibility test for websites seeking the law’s protections. That same year, the White House issued an executive order calling on the Federal Communications Commission to interpret Section 230 in a more narrow way. The executive order faced a number of legal and procedural problems, not least of which was the fact that the FCC is not part of the judicial branch, it does not regulate social media or content moderation decisions and it is an independent agency that, by law, does not take direction from the White House. Even though the Trump-era efforts to curtail Section 230 never bore fruit, conservatives are still looking for opportunities to do so. And they aren’t alone. Since 2016, when social media platforms’ role in spreading Russian election disinformation broke open a national dialogue about the companies’ handling of toxic content, Democrats have increasingly railed against Section 230. By safeguarding platforms’ freedom to moderate content as they see fit, Democrats have said, Section 230 has allowed websites to escape accountability for hosting hate speech and misinformation that others have recognized as objectionable but that social media companies can’t or won’t remove themselves. The result is a bipartisan hatred for Section 230, even if the two parties cannot agree on why Section 230 is flawed or what policies might appropriately take its place. “I would be prepared to make a bet that if we took a vote on a plain Section 230 repeal, it would clear this committee with virtually every vote,” said Rhode Island Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse at a hearing last week of the Senate Judiciary Committee. “The problem, where we bog down, is that we want 230-plus. We want to repeal 230 and then have ‘XYZ.’ And we don’t agree on what the ‘XYZ’ are.”","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.714, 'pos': 0.286, 'compound': 0.5574}",156,101.0,0.036,0.7845,0.18,0.4595,0.114,0.781,0.106,-0.9848,71.682,118.1672666666667,304.0,0.38870811403508787
Biden administration rolls out new asylum restrictions mirroring Trump-era policy,2023-02-21,"The Biden administration released a new rule Tuesday that largely bars migrants who traveled through other countries on their way to the US-Mexico border from applying for asylum in the United States, marking a departure from decadeslong protocol. The new 153-page proposed regulation, which could affect tens of thousands of people, is the most restrictive of a patchwork of policies put in place by the Biden administration to try and manage the US-Mexico border and is reminiscent of a Trump-era policy. The proposed rule would presume asylum ineligibility and ""encourage migrants to avail themselves of lawful, safe, and orderly pathways into the United States, or otherwise to seek asylum or other protection in countries through which they travel, thereby reducing reliance on human smuggling networks that exploit migrants for financial gain,"" according to the text of the regulation. While there are some exceptions, the rule would generally apply to migrants who unlawfully cross the US-Mexico border. It doesn't apply to unaccompanied migrant children. ""To be clear, this was not our first preference or even our second,"" an administration official told reporters, adding that the onus is on Congress to pass reform. ""These temporary measures are being taken out of necessity,"" the administration official said.  Administration officials on Tuesday rejected the comparison to the Trump administration, saying that it's not a categorical ban on asylum and emphasizing efforts to expand access to legal pathways to the US, including a recently launched parole program for certain nationalities. The proposed rule will be posted in the Federal Register for a 30-day public comment period and likely take effect in May, when a pandemic-era border restriction, known as Title 42, is set to expire. The rule is also expected to last for two years. The Biden policy, like the Trump-era one, has garnered wide condemnation from Democratic lawmakers and immigrant advocates. In a private meeting with Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas last week, Democratic Hispanic senators expressed their ongoing concerns about the rule and opposition to it, according to a source familiar with the meeting. Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus had previously voiced frustration with the administration when the rule was initially announced, describing being blindsided by new border policies and the lack of engagement. On Tuesday, House Judiciary Committee ranking member Jerry Nadler, a New York Democrat, and Immigration Integrity, Security, and Enforcement Subcommittee ranking member Pramila Jayapal, a Washington Democrat, slammed the move. ""We are deeply disappointed in the Biden administration's proposal to limit access to asylum,"" the joint statement read. ""The ability to seek asylum is a bedrock principle protected by federal law and should never be violated."" Mayorkas walked Latino senators through the regulation, according to the source, but it didn't appear to ease concerns. Immigrant advocates also criticized the asylum rule Tuesday, arguing it violates President Joe Biden's pledge to restore asylum. ""This rule reaches into the dustbin of history to resurrect one of the most harmful and illegal anti-asylum policies of the Trump administration,"" said Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, President and CEO of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, in a statement. ""Requiring persecuted people to first seek protection in countries with no functioning asylum systems themselves is a ludicrous and life-threatening proposal."" To manage the flow, the administration has leaned on Title 42 to turn away certain migrants encountered at the US-Mexico border. But with the clock ticking on its potential expiration and amid ongoing litigation, officials are considering other enforcement measures as tens of thousands of migrants continue to move in the Western Hemisphere. Among the plans being considered by the administration is use of a fast-track deportation process known as ""expedited removal."" While Mexico has been taking migrants under Title 42 and previously under a Trump-era border policy known as ""remain in Mexico,"" the plan would appear to mark the first time Mexico would take back non-Mexican deportees at a large scale. The Department of Homeland Security has denied reports of the plan. The shifting migration patterns has put a strain on federal resources, as border authorities have encountered an increasing number of Cubans, Venezuelans and Nicaraguans. The US is largely barred from deporting migrants from those nationalities back to their home countries because of strained diplomatic relations. The US has since begun sending migrants from Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua to Mexico under Title 42 and opened a separate program that allows migrants of those nationalities and Haiti to apply to legally come to the United States. Thousands of migrants have already applied. Administration officials have credited the program for leading to a significant drop in border crossings.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",30,102.0,0.0686,0.8577999999999999,0.0734,-0.08983333333333333,0.072,0.864,0.065,-0.9382,-2.695,102.1078666666667,292.0,0.34968447488584486
What to know about Russia's latest move on nuclear weapons,2023-02-21,"Russian President Vladimir Putin's announcement Tuesday that Russia would suspend participation in the New START treaty, a key nuclear arms reduction agreement, is the latest in a series of ominous declarations in which he has made reference to his nuclear arsenal. What specifically this latest move will mean in terms of the worldwide nuclear threat is something of a question mark. The treaty was already essentially paused since Russia had recently refused to open up its arsenal to inspectors. CNN's report notes that Putin is not technically withdrawing from the treaty, so his declaration ""appears to be formalizing its current position."" Russia's Foreign Ministry later clarified that Moscow will continue to respect the caps established in the treaty and that Putin's suspension of the treaty is ""reversible."" What is New START? New START -- ""START"" is shorthand for ""Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty"" -- is the last in a long series of nuclear treaties between the US and Russia, previously the Soviet Union. Strategic nuclear weapons are larger warheads that could wipe away cities. Russia and the US both also have smaller ""tactical"" nuclear weapons not covered by the New START treaty. Much less is known about Russia's arsenal of tactical nuclear weapons. Read more about Russia and tactical nuclear weapons. First signed during the Obama administration to take effect in 2011 and then renewed in February 2021, shortly after President Joe Biden took office, the strategic arms treaty places a cap on the number nuclear armaments each country can have. What are the caps on 'strategic' nuclear weapons? The caps, as described by the US State Department, are: 700 deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), deployed submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), and deployed heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments;
1,550 nuclear warheads on deployed ICBMs, deployed SLBMs, and deployed heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments (each such heavy bomber is counted as one warhead toward this limit);
800 deployed and non-deployed ICBM launchers, SLBM launchers, and heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments. The current extension lasts until February 2026, but both countries have complained about the other's compliance.  In January, the US accused Russia of, among other things, continuing to refuse to allow inspections of its nuclear facilities, a key verification condition on the treaty.  Russia has raised questions about US claims it converted some previously nuclear-capable bombers to only carry conventional weapons. Here's a 60-page Congressional Research Service report on debates around New START.  Generally speaking, recent Democratic administrations have pursued treaties like this and recent Republican administrations have questioned their utility. President George W. Bush withdrew the US from an Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, and President Donald Trump withdrew the US from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. Presidents Barack Obama and Biden both endorsed New START. What will happen now? I went back to the authors of the 2017 book, ""Nuclear Weapons and Coercive Diplomacy"" -- Matthew Fuhrmann, a professor at Texas A&M University, and Todd Sechser, a professor at the University of Virginia -- for their assessment of what this new development means in terms of worldwide nuclear security.  I've spoken to them periodically over the past year about Putin's nuclear rhetoric. I asked Sechser some specific questions and Fuhrmann offered some general thoughts about what Putin's move means. Portions of both conversations are below. This feels like a form of retaliation FUHRMANN: Putin's announcement strikes me as retaliation for increased US support for Ukraine, including Joe Biden's recent visit to Kyiv. Russian leaders seem to believe that the US is now more determined to reverse its invasion of Ukraine, trying to facilitate what they would see as a strategic defeat.  However, Putin's announcement on New START formalizes much of what Russia was already doing. The treaty requires reciprocal inspections to verify compliance, but Russia has not allowed this to happen since last fall, when they were supposed to resume following the Covid pandemic.  Based on this, Washington had already accused Russia of being in noncompliance with the treaty.  More symbolism than substance WOLF: Does Putin's announcement materially change the nuclear situation?  SECHSER: In the short run, the impact of this announcement is more symbolism than substance. Russia already announced six months ago that it would no longer allow inspections of its nuclear arsenal. And it is not going to suddenly build a massive new arsenal tomorrow. But the symbolism is important: This is the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty between the United States and Russia.  In the long run, the deterioration of US-Russian relations, along with the demise of this treaty, provide both motive and opportunity for a new nuclear arms race. US support for Ukraine has evolved in important ways WOLF: Many of the guardrails the US had put on its support for Ukraine in the hopes of not threatening Russia within its borders -- not sending certain offensive weapons like longer-range missiles -- have been abandoned as the war has progressed. Now there is serious talk of supplying F-16s. Have the US and the West gone too far in arming Ukraine? Should they go further? SECHSER: I am struck by how careful the Biden administration has been with its military assistance, even going so far as to modify weapons systems so Ukraine could not use them to launch long-range attacks into Russia. It has provided increasingly sophisticated weapons, but only gradually. In a way, Putin's announcement about New START can be seen as a validation of this careful strategy because of what it is not: namely, a massive military response against the West.  Only Putin knows where his red lines are, but this announcement suggests that the United States has not yet crossed them. Putin's nuclear threats have failed so far WOLF: One year into the war -- and about a year after we first talked -- I wonder what you think people should know about how the nuclear threat has evolved. SECHSER: It is hard to ignore just how little Putin's nuclear threats have accomplished. After a year of bluster about Russia using ""all available means"" against its enemies, the Ukrainians have not budged and the West is increasing its commitment to Ukraine, not shrinking away. If anything, Putin's nuclear bellicosity has only fueled the international backlash against Russia. Russia's experience over the past year offers a vivid reminder that nuclear weapons are not a magic wand. A new era of arms control WOLF: This is the last remaining treaty on nuclear weapons between the US and Russia. Is the era of nonproliferation essentially over? SECHSER: US-Russian arms control has been on a downward spiral for a long time. This is the fourth US-Russian arms control treaty to come to an end during Putin's regime.  The extension of New START two years ago was a cautiously optimistic sign, but the invasion of Ukraine erased that progress. This announcement is really the culmination of more than a decade of gradual erosion. It is hard to see a future for US-Russian arms control as long as Putin remains in power. Probability of Russia using nuclear weapons remains low FUHRMANN: The potential for nuclear escalation increases as the situation in Ukraine worsens for Russia. The overall probability of Russian nuclear use remains low, in my opinion, but it will increase if desperation sets in for Russia. (Former Russian President Dmitry) Medvedev wrote recently, ""Nuclear powers do not lose major conflicts on which their fate depends.""  Nuclear-armed countries have ended wars in the past on less than favorable terms without using nuclear weapons. Examples include the US experiences in Korea and Vietnam, as well as the Soviet war in Afghanistan from 1979 to 1989.  The question becomes whether Russian leaders see the stakes in Ukraine as sufficiently vital to justify using tactical nuclear weapons -- an action that would be tremendously costly for Russia and potentially Putin himself.","{'neg': 0.244, 'neu': 0.756, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.4404}",62,103.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.109,0.816,0.075,-0.9942,0.0,97.2040666666667,343.0,0.2833937803692907
A Wisconsin Supreme Court race holds high stakes for abortion rights and the 2024 election,2023-02-19,"What's typically an under-the-radar judicial election in Wisconsin has turned into a high-stakes and expensive fight for control of the state's Supreme Court -- with the future of abortion, voting rights and redistricting in this battleground state hanging in the balance.  Millions of dollars in advertising have been reserved ahead of Tuesday's primary election -- the first of two rounds that will determine who replaces a retiring conservative justice, potentially shifting the balance on Wisconsin's seven-judge high court. While the election is nonpartisan, each of the four contenders is squarely in the liberal or conservative camps.   ""This seat is crucial to the balance of the court, and the court is crucial to the balance of the state,"" said Barry Burden, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and director of its Elections Research Center.  In a state where Democrats control the governor's office and Republicans hold sway in the legislature, the Wisconsin Supreme Court could become the final arbiter on an array of consequential issues, including the fate of the state's prohibition on abortion in nearly all cases -- enacted in 1849. The US Supreme Court's decision last summer ending federal legal protections for the procedure has super-charged the rhetoric -- and spending -- around abortion in the Wisconsin race.   The state Supreme Court could also play a crucial role in the 2024 election. Wisconsin was a key location of former President Donald Trump's attempts to overturn his 2020 loss, and the refusal of a conservative justice on the state Supreme Court to go along with an effort that year to toss out ballots in two heavily Democratic counties looms large in the rivalry between the two right-leaning candidates in this year's race.  ""The Wisconsin Supreme Court race is the most important election in the country this year to set the stage for 2024,"" Ben Wikler, the chairman of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, told CNN.  The executive director of the Wisconsin GOP, Mark Jefferson, described the contest as one with ""every significant issue of the last generation on the ballot.""  Early voting in the primary is already underway, with the final day of balloting Tuesday. The top two finishers will advance to the general election on April 4.   Conservative majority on the line Wisconsin is one of 38 states that use some form of elections to select their Supreme Court judges, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University's law school. In many cases, those are retention elections in which previously appointed justices run unopposed. Currently, conservatives hold a 4-3 majority on the Wisconsin Supreme Court and have voted in recent years to prohibit ballot drop boxes and have selected maps that cemented Republicans' solid majority in the state legislature. This year, the departure of a conservative justice, Patience Roggensack, gives liberals an opportunity to seize the majority. The side that prevails in the election this spring is expected to control the court through the 2024 presidential election.  The candidates hoping to advance to the April general election are liberals Janet Protasiewicz, a Milwaukee County circuit court judge, and Everett Mitchell, a circuit judge in Dane County; and conservatives Daniel Kelly, a former state Supreme Court justice, and Jennifer Dorow, a judge perhaps best known for presiding over the trial of a man convicted of killing six and injuring scores more in a 2021 attack on a Christmas parade in Waukesha, Wisconsin.  Outside money has flooded the race, surpassing candidate spending. As of Thursday afternoon, orders for TV and radio ads focused on the race had hit $7 million, according to advertising tracked by Kantar Media/CMAG for the Brennan Center. Experts say the spending on the race could smash the previous record -- $15.2 million spent on a 2004 Illinois Supreme Court race, according to the Brennan Center -- for the most expensive campaign for a single state Supreme Court seat.  If a liberal and conservative emerge as the top two vote-getters Tuesday, this ""will unquestionably be the most expensive (Supreme Court) race in Wisconsin history and quite possibly the most expensive race in the nation,"" said Doug Keith, a Brennan Center counsel who works on judiciary issues. Abortion at the forefront   Protasiewicz has led the field in fundraising and ad spending, according to the latest data. In a sign of the potency of the abortion issue in the contest, she has run television spots that put her support for abortion rights front and center.   Outside groups on both sides of the issue are participating in this race in ways that go beyond their prior involvement in similar elections.  ""We just know that the outcome of this race has serious implications for abortion rights in the years to come,"" Tiffany Wynn, a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood Advocates of Wisconsin, told CNN. Justices on Wisconsin's high court serve ten-year terms.  The US Supreme Court in its Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision last June overturned the Roe v. Wade precedent that said that the US Constitution protected abortion rights. Since then, state courts have become ground zero in the legal fights over abortions access.   ""These races are more important, for obvious reasons, than ever after Dobbs,"" said Kelsey Pritchard, a spokesperson for the state affairs team at Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, which supports anti-abortion candidates. She pointed to a recent ruling by the South Carolina Supreme Court striking down a six-week abortion ban on state constitutional grounds and said that the anti-abortion movement is at risk of ""mini-Roe decisions all across the country.""  Abortion rights advocates feel bolstered by last year's midterm elections -- particularly how they played out in Wisconsin, with Democratic incumbents, Gov. Tony Evers and Attorney General Josh Kaul, winning reelection after campaigns highlighting their commitment to abortion rights. Anti-abortion advocates, meanwhile, recognize that their messaging fell short in the fall, and they're adjusting their strategy for driving like-minded voters to the polls.  ""We have a great base, but this far, in the majority of conversations we have had with them, many are not even aware that abortion is going to be the fundamental issue for this race,"" Gracie Skogman, political action committee director for the anti-abortion group Wisconsin Right to Life, told CNN.  ""They're not aware that the fate of our current law rests in the hands of the court, depending on this election. And so that's the case we're doing the best to make.""  While Protasiewicz has pushed an unabashed abortion rights message in her campaign, the other candidates have found other ways to explicitly or implicitly signal how they'd approach the issue.   Like Protasiewicz, Everett has been openly critical of the Dobbs ruling. He told CNN that ""you can criticize that and still say, 'I am going to be a judge who looks at the facts, looks at the law, and we go from there.'""  The two conservative candidates have vowed to honor the US Supreme Court's Dobbs decision and have stressed that they would not legislate from the bench -- rhetoric that has been interpreted to mean that they would let the state's law, enacted before women in the country gained the right to vote, stand.   In a statement to CNN, the Kelly campaign singled out Protasiewicz, saying that she sees legal disputes ""not as matters to be resolved according to the law, but as opportunities to enact her personal values.""  Protasiewicz defended her upfront approach to abortion, which made her a target of a complaint alleging that she violated a judicial code of conduct that bars judges from committing to how they will vote on issues that may come before them. Her team has cast the complaint as politically motivated.  ""I really think the electorate deserves to know the values of the people that are running for office,"" Protasiewicz told CNN. ""We have this kind of fake, little smokescreen, where certain people think justices should just say that 'I'm going to follow the law,' and that doesn't tell you very much about the person at all.""  Kelly, who is seeking a comeback after losing his high court seat in 2020, has been endorsed by the largest anti-abortion organizations in the state, and he recently picked up the support of the national Susan B. Anthony group. With that endorsement comes a six-figure mail, phone and text message campaign on his behalf.  A looming presidential race  This spring's Supreme Court race is expected to set the stage for the 2024 election, as the Wisconsin high court is likely to be asked to weigh in on the ground rules for next year's contest. ""Even a tiny shift in voting rules can affect the outcome of a presidential election,"" said Wikler, the state Democratic Party chair. ""So, what happens in Wisconsin on April 4 will have a direct impact on who gets sworn into the next term as president of the United States.""  Last year, the court's conservative majority barred the use of most ballot drop boxes and prohibited local election officials from filling in missing information on absentee ballot return envelopes. Republicans see the state's voter ID law as on the line in the race, with the state GOP's Jefferson accusing Democrats of trying to use the courts to ""strike down any ballot security measure they can.""  It is also not lost on those involved in this election that the Wisconsin Supreme Court played a pivotal role in 2020, by rebuffing Trump's efforts to throw out ballots in Democratic-leaning counties.   ""Because Wisconsin sits at the apex of a lot of national conversations -- whether it's the Senate race or presidential -- I think Wisconsin, at this moment, may end up deciding bigger things like the presidential election, like it did 2020,"" Everett, one of the two liberal candidates, told CNN. ""I think the implications of that decision that was made in 2020 is the reason why people are paying attention at such a greater detail.""  Brian Hagedorn, the right-leaning justice who sided with the liberals in the Trump case -- and who also ruled with the liberals to uphold Covid-19 restrictions -- has been invoked by Kelly as a cudgel against his conservative rival Dorow. Kelly has pointed to his 2020 endorsement of Hagedorn to explain why he won't commit to endorsing Dorow should she prevail over him Tuesday, implying that she can't be depended on to rule conservatively from the bench.  ""I think it's just terribly presumptuous to say that I have to endorse her blind,"" Kelly said of Dorow during a recent appearance on conservative Milwaukee broadcaster Mark Belling's radio show. ""And, especially after Brian Hagedorn, I'm just not doing blind endorsements.""  Dorow's campaign did not make her available for an interview for this story.

Rep. David Cicilline to resign from Congress June 1 to run foundation,2023-02-21,"Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, will resign from Congress June 1 to run the Rhode Island Foundation.  The First Congressional District of Rhode Island is a Democratic stronghold, with Cicilline winning by almost 30 points in his last midterm election. There will be a special election held to determine who fills the seat.  ""For more than a decade, the people of Rhode Island entrusted me with a sacred duty to represent them in Congress, and it is a responsibility I put my heart and soul into every day,"" the congressman said in a statement released by his office.  He went on to say, ""The chance to lead the Rhode Island Foundation was unexpected, but it is an extraordinary opportunity to have an even more direct and meaningful impact on the lives of residents of our state."" The Rhode Island Foundation provides funding for local nonprofits. The Boston Globe first reported the announcement. Cicilline has held the seat for Rhode Island's First Congressional District since 2011. Prior to that, he served as the mayor of Providence for two terms. Cicilline was also a member of the Rhode Island House of Representatives for four terms. In early 2021, Cicilline served as one of the impeachment managers during the second impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump. This story has been updated with additional details.

"Opinion: In a war of unending surprises, Biden has another up his sleeve",2023-02-21,"As the world prepares to mark the first anniversary of Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, President Joe Biden made a historic, unannounced visit to the capital of the embattled country.  The risky trip on Monday to an active war zone was not just a powerful symbol of American support, it was a shot in the arm to a population that has endured Russia's devastating attacks on civilian apartment blocks, hospitals, schools and the power stations that provide heat and electricity.  ""It's just something unbelievable that at a time like this the President of the United States is coming to Kyiv,"" Andrei Ketov, a 48-year-old Ukrainian service member, told CNN. Biden's visit to Ukraine a year into the biggest war in Europe since World War II underscores just how badly Russian President Vladimir Putin miscalculated. Putin didn't just misjudge Ukraine's determination to resist and its revulsion with his claims that Ukraine is not a real country. He may have just bought into the Kremlin's own malicious propaganda about the feebleness of America's leadership — echoed and amplified by Biden's political foes.  Standing alongside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Biden reminisced about a phone call the two had ""that dark night"" a year ago when the war started. Zelensky could hear explosions in the background. The world was preparing for the fall of Kyiv, Biden recalled, ""perhaps even the end of Ukraine."" Now, a year later, ""Kyiv stands, and Ukraine stands. Democracy stands,"" he declared, adding, ""The Americans stand with you, and the world stands with you."" Who could have imagined in 2022, when Ukraine's situation looked so hopeless that the United States offered to evacuate Zelensky — and he famously refused — that a year later the Ukrainian people would have put up such a strong resistance, and the West would have given so much support for their efforts? And that instead of Putin having a military parade in Kyiv, it would be Biden walking in the Ukrainian capital's streets, arriving at the ornate Mariinsky Palace, the official residence of the Ukrainian President? Russia's military bloggers were aghast. A ""demonstrative humiliation of Russia"" is how Russian journalist Sergey Mardan described the moment. An account on the Telegram app managed by Russian service members remarked with bitter sarcasm that ""we are waiting in the Russian city of Kiev for the president of the Russian Federation, but not for the (President of the) United States."" Recall that in the early days of the invasion, Ukraine said it found Russian forces had brought along their dress uniforms apparently expecting a victory parade. Instead, the war has given the world an unending series of surprises. Russia's army turned out to be much less competent than anyone expected; Putin was not quite the genius many believed.  Zelensky was much steelier and inspiring than almost any leader in recent memory. NATO was more united, and Europeans more willing to support Ukraine than anyone — including Putin — anticipated. And then there's Biden. It's a curious phenomenon that those who have most feared Biden have tried to undermine him by claiming he is weak and incompetent. Biden is 80 and walks with a stiff gait. But he has no shortage of courage (air raid sirens sounded over Kyiv while Biden was there) or, crucially, competence.  It's possible that under a different US President, Russia would have quickly conquered Ukraine. Biden made mincemeat of Putin's strategy to make it look as if the war was a result of a Ukrainian provocation, revealing the plan before it unfolded. Then he rallied the NATO alliance, which had been so grievously disparaged by former President Donald Trump.  Perhaps Putin, after watching the divisions inflamed by Trump's rhetoric, thought NATO would not stand with Ukraine.  In fact, one might excuse Putin for thinking the US would not support Ukraine very forcefully. After all, one of the two major political parties in the United States had made Trump its leader. And Trump — in one of the sharpest contrasts with Biden — had toyed with Zelensky's pleas for help. Who can forget the infamous phone call after which Trump was impeached, when Zelensky implored the US President for help to deter an aggressive Russia? Trump's response, ""I would like you to do us a favor though,"" trying to push Ukraine into launching an investigation against Biden, the candidate Trump claimed was weak, even though he feared him as his most effective opponent. Now Biden has made it possible for the Ukrainian people to stand strong against a Russian President so obsessed with conquering his neighboring country that he has destroyed Russia's standing in the world, rolled back three decades of progress and seems prepared to send untold numbers of Russians to die to prevent a democracy from flourishing next door to his autocracy. A joyous Zelensky said Biden's visit ""brings us closer to victory,"" adding it will ""have repercussions on the battlefield in liberating our territories."" Biden promised continuing support from the US, which is what most Americans want though backing has weakened somewhat. GOP Rep. Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told CNN that bipartisan support for Ukraine is ""still very strong."" Of course, some GOP members criticized Biden for going to Ukraine. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene called the trip ""incredibly insulting,"" a sign of an ""America Last"" policy. And Rep. Scott Perry — at the center of a legal dispute with the Justice Department over his cell phone in the special counsel's January 6 probe — described as ""breathtaking"" that Biden would help Ukraine defend its borders and not do the same for America.  The day after his visit to Kyiv, Biden will give a major speech, rallying the world to Ukraine's side, and vowing to continue helping Ukraine defend its independence and its democracy, because Ukraine today is the front line in the global contest between democracy and autocracy.","{'neg': 0.247, 'neu': 0.633, 'pos': 0.12, 'compound': -0.4588}",42,106.0,0.11266666666666665,0.774,0.11333333333333333,0.06849999999999999,0.107,0.783,0.11,0.6011,2.877,38.980000000000025,205.0,0.19014634146341475
"February 20, 2023 - Russia-Ukraine news",2023-02-19,"Our live coverage of Russia's war in Ukraine has moved here. China is willing to work with other countries to achieve an early ceasefire and lasting peace in Ukraine, the country's top diplomat Wang Yi said while visiting Budapest on Monday, according to Chinese state news agency Xinhua. ""China will work with all the peace-loving countries, including Hungary, to make efforts to achieve an early ceasefire and lasting peace,"" Wang Yi said during a meeting with Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó, Xinhua reported.  Wang, who was named Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s top foreign policy adviser last month, is due to arrive in Russia this week, a year after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  Neither Russia nor China has specified whether Wang would meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin. However, on Monday, Russian spokesman Dmitry Peskov said ""we do not exclude a meeting"" between Wang and Putin.  China’s Foreign Ministry said earlier the visit to Moscow will provide an opportunity for China and Russia to continue to develop their strategic partnership and “exchange views” on “international and regional hotspot issues of shared interest.” Some background: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Wang on Saturday in Munich, Germany, and warned “about the implications and consequences” if Beijing increases its support for Russia’s war effort, according to a US readout of the meeting. On Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned China not to give any support to Russia, saying it could lead to another world war. There is no more powerful symbol of Vladimir Putin’s failure. A year ago, the Russian leader launched a blitzkrieg against Ukraine, mocking its history and sovereignty, sending his tanks churning toward Kyiv to obliterate the democratically elected government led by a former comic actor. His purpose was clear: To crush once and for all Ukraine’s dreams of joining the West and to force it to return to the orbit of greater Russia. Back then, anyone predicting how the anniversary of the war would be marked might have mused about a Russian military parade and a visit by Putin himself to a puppet leader he installed in a nation again under Moscow’s iron fist. The reality is far different following heroic Ukrainian resistance bolstered by weapons sent by NATO members. The president of the United States, in overcoat and shades, strolled through Kyiv in daylight, visiting a historic church as air raid sirens wailed and standing exposed alongside President Volodymyr Zelensky in the city’s vast, open and iconic St. Michael’s Square. His presence sent a message of defiance to Putin most directly and a cherished sign of resolve and empathy for the people of Ukraine. His audience also included European powers in a western alliance that Biden has led and invigorated like no president since the end of the Cold War. And every time a commander-in-chief makes such an audacious splash on the world stage he’s also making a point to Americans – on whose support continuing extraordinary support for Ukraine’s war effort depends – and to his own fervent domestic critics. Read more here ##Biden## Nailia Manzurina’s eyes filled with tears as she remembered the moment she and her two young sons had to separate from her husband in their native Russia. “Praise God it was just temporary,” she said as she wiped away tears. It was late September 2022 and emotions were high in Russia because President Vladimir Putin had just imposed the country’s first military draft since World War II. Social media videos showed mothers and wives wailing as their loved ones were dragged into the war in Ukraine. Young men rushed to neighboring countries in droves to avoid getting pulled into the fight. Nailia’s husband, Mikhail Manzurin, 25, qualified for the draft but he disagreed with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. And he felt, very strongly, that he shouldn’t be forced to serve in the military against his will. “I don’t want to kill (the) innocent people of Ukraine. They’re protecting their territories. They’re protecting their homes. And I don’t want to be a part of this invasion,” Mikhail Manzurin said. Fearing Mikhail would be drafted, jailed or worse, the family decided to flee, embarking on a multi-country odyssey with their newborn, Philip, and toddler, Mark, that would take them through Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Dubai, Mexico and ultimately to the United States – all with the help of strangers. They would become part of a vast wave of Russians seeking shelter from the war in the United States. Over the past six months, data posted by American border authorities shows that the number of Russian citizens they have encountered has nearly tripled: from 1,645 Russians in August 2022 (the month before Russia’s draft began) to 4,509 in January. In total, nearly 22,000 Russians, including the Manzurins, have tried entering the United States through the country’s southern border since October 2022, the first full month after the draft was announced, according to the latest US Customs and Border Protection data. Read more here Japan will provide an additional $5.5 billion (around 738 billion yen) in financial assistance to Ukraine, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced Monday, just days before the one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion.  ""Japan is in a position to lead the world's efforts to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression and to uphold a free and open international order based on the rule of law,"" Kishida said while speaking in Tokyo.  Japan had already pledged $600 million in financial assistance, millions worth of humanitarian aid and joined Western allies in imposing sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.  Kishida also announced he will host an online summit of G7 leaders with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday, the day of the anniversary and ahead of the annual G7 summit in Hiroshima in May.  US President Joe Biden’s visit to Kyiv on Monday was ""very important"" to Ukrainians as a demonstration of solidarity and unity, according to Oksana Markarova, the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States. ""Even though our countries are divided by thousands of kilometers and ocean, we are united by bravery and by love for freedom and our willingness to fight for it. So it has been very important for the people of Ukraine to see American president on the Presidents Day in Kyiv and saying that our strategic friend number one, United States, is with us in this fight,"" she told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. Markarova said she hopes Biden’s trip “will also unlock a lot of additional support, which is so needed in order to finish this war faster.” Zelensky has been pushing for more US weaponry, including fighter jets, a request that is being met with skepticism by the US and other Western officials, who say the jets would be impractical, both because they require considerable training and because Russia has extensive anti-aircraft systems that could easily shoot them down. But, while in Kyiv on Monday, Biden did announce new military assistance and incoming Russian sanctions. As to how the next phase of the war will look, Markarova said Ukraine is “prepared for everything. “We are ready to defend our country,” she said. “As I said a year ago, Ukrainians will not give up and will not surrender, and that's what we will do. We will not surrender, and we will not rest until we win.” ##Biden## President Joe Biden has crossed into Poland after an unprecedented trip to the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv on Monday. There, the president reaffirmed his support and announced new aid for Ukraine. On the ground, Russia is increasing the number of soldiers in Ukraine, prompting calls from world leaders for allies to continue sending military support and additional ammunition to Kyiv. Here's what you need to know: Biden's surprise visit to Ukraine: The United States president made an unprecedented trip to Kyiv Monday for the first time since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Biden walked alongside President Volodymyr Zelensky as air raid sirens could be heard ringing out around the capital. Biden announced a half-billion dollars of additional assistance to Ukraine and incoming sanctions against Moscow as he vowed to continue to support Kyiv. Zelensky praised Biden's visit, saying it leaves Ukraine ""closer to victory."" 
Delivery of tanks: Portugal's defense ministry said it is ready to send three Leopard 2 A6 combat tanks to Ukraine in March. Several countries have offered to give tanks to Ukraine, though not all have confirmed how many they plan to send. Tanks from allies come at a critical point in the war, as Russia prepares for a spring offensive and as Ukraine hopes to retake territory seized over the past 12 months.
Increasing volume of Russian troops: Russia is massing “almost twice the number of soldiers that were there at the beginning of the war"" in Ukraine, European Union’s Foreign Policy Chief Josep Borrell said. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said this is a result of Russia trying to make up for poor equipment and logistics, describing the strategy as ""throwing just waves of people on the defensive lines."" The NATO chief said Putin is ""planning for more war,"" as Borrell urged allies to send more ammunition to Ukraine to counter the threat.
Tensions with China: Zelensky is warning China not to give any support to Russia in the war, saying it could lead to another world war. On Sunday, the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told CBS' ""Face the Nation"" program that Washington is concerned China is considering providing “lethal support” to Russia’s war in Ukraine.   
Possible ban of Olympic athletes: The US and more than 30 other countries are backing a proposed ban of Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing in international sports, according to a joint statement published by the British government. The countries asked the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to reverse its decision to create a pathway for Russian and Belarusian athletes to participate in the upcoming Games as “neutral athletes.""  ##Catch Up## Ukrainian soldiers defending the fiercely contested eastern city of Bakhmut from Russian forces thanked US President Joe Biden for visiting Kyiv on Monday, nearly a year since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion.  ""This is the most powerful message of support for Ukraine at this moment,"" Commander Yuriy Fedorovych Madyar, a colonel in the 28th Separate Mechanized Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, said in a video published on a popular Telegram channel that features war-related content.  Madyar is walking alongside another Ukrainian soldier amid destroyed buildings in what they said was Bakhmut. He talks about the situation on the battlefield and references Russian President Vladimir Putin's upcoming address on Tuesday. ""Thank you, Mr. President Biden! God bless America! Thank you for your support and help,"" the soldier walking with him says in the video. Madyar said there hadn't been ""territorial success for the enemy in the Bakhmut outskirts"" on Monday. CNN is not able to independently verify those claims.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said last Wednesday that the situation in Bakhmut was ""the most difficult out of all"" the contested areas in Ukraine. The visit Monday by US President Joe Biden was an important day for Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said Monday in an evening address.  ""Today was a symbolic day. The 362nd day of a full-scale war, and we, in our free capital of our free country, are hosting a visit from our powerful ally, the President of the United States of America, and talking to him about the future of Ukraine, our relations, the whole of Europe and global democracy. This is an indicator of how resilient Ukraine is. And how important Ukraine is to the world,"" Zelensky said.  The specific steps ""to liberate our still-occupied territories and to guarantee reliable security for our country and for all the peoples of Europe"" are known. ""All we need is determination,"" he said.  Zelensky thanked the American people, members of Congress from both parties and members of Biden's team for helping strengthen the alliance between the two countries. ""Now we are convinced that there is nothing that can undermine our democracy. Not a single aspect of Ukrainian life is and will ever be fragile. Our strength is a powerful contribution to the strength of all freedom-loving nations in the world,"" he said.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis criticized American aid to Ukraine as an ""open-ended blank check"" and questioned whether the United States should be engaged in the Russian conflict at all. ""I don't think it's in our interest to be getting into a proxy war with China, getting involved over things like the borderlands or over Crimea,"" DeSantis told Fox & Friends on Monday, referring to the Ukraine territories that Russia has seized through military force. The remarks, made on the occasion of Biden's surprise visit to Kyiv, Ukraine, were some of DeSantis' most direct comments about the US involvement in the war since the conflict started a year ago.   Asked ""what a win looks like"" for the US, DeSantis downplayed Moscow's military actions to date and said Russia was ""really wounded"" and had suffered ""tremendous, tremendous loses"" without acknowledging the role that US weapons, military intelligence and aid have played in shaping the conflict.  DeSantis insisted Russia is not a threat ""on the same level as China.""   ""The fear of Russia going into NATO countries and all that, and steamrolling, that has not even come close to happening,"" DeSantis said. ""I think they have shown themselves to be a third-rate military power.""   US President Joe Biden has left Ukraine after a highly symbolic covert visit.  He crossed the border into Poland at roughly 8 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET), according to a report from the traveling press pool. Biden traveled by train in and out of Kyiv, making the 10-hour journey with only a handful of advisers and two journalists. Biden flew to Poland aboard a C-32 aircraft with a refueling stop in Germany before boarding the train into Ukraine on Sunday. The train went by night into Ukraine, making only a few stops to collect additional security.  ##Biden## To counter a growing number of Russian troops, Ukraine needs more ammunition, in addition to other pledges of military support from allies, the European Union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said. Russia is massing “almost twice the number of soldiers that were there at the beginning of the war"" in Ukraine, adding that the next few weeks will be crucial, he said. “The Ukrainian army urgently needs large amounts of ammunition to counter Russian aggression,” Borrell said. ""A gun needs a bullet.”  “For that, time is of essence. Speed means lives. We need to respond quickly. Not only more support, but to provide it quicker,” Borrell added. The best way to get ammunition to Ukraine quickly is to share existing European army stockpiles so that there is no time wasted waiting for them to be produced, he said. ""We have to use what has already been produced and stockpiled, or what has already been contracted and will be produced in the coming days. Priority has to be given to the supplies for the Ukrainian army, as much as we can,"" he said.  Borrel also said a tenth package of sanctions against Russia was also discussed at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels on Monday, announcing that they have been “presented as a Regulation for the Council to approve,"" which should happen in the “next hours, or next days."" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba asserted to not ""overestimate"" Russian capacity to produce weapons, as he urged allies to expand sanctions against entities producing Russian missiles.   Kuleba sat down with CNN's Christiane Amanpour at the Munich Security Conference over the weekend for an interview that aired on CNN on Monday.   “Our partners have a tool in their hands to suppress this production, which is sanctions,” he said. “For example, we proposed a very specific list of Russian entities involved in the productions of missiles. So put them on the sanctions, make their life even more complicated and suppress the production of missiles.”   Addressing growing concerns in Europe that ammunition supplies are diminishing, Kuleba stated “there will never be enough ammunition as long as the war continues”.   “Yes, if you ask me what we need the most here and now, I’d artillery munitions. If you ask me [to] imagine that’s solved, what is next, I’d say Howitzers to use this ammunition,” the foreign minister said.  “Businesses need contracts and to have contracts you need money. Therefore, if governments want to support Ukraine, they can finance their own companies by contracting their production of ammunition and other weapons, and that’s what we are working on,” Kuleba continued.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that a world war could break out if China supported Russia against Ukraine.    “My hope is that Beijing will maintain a pragmatic attitude, you risk World War III otherwise, I think they are well aware of that,” he said in an interview with prominent Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, published on Sunday — in response to the paper asking him if Kyiv thought China would send weapons to Russia.  Zelensky said he has personally appealed to the Chinese leadership through direct channels and publicly “not to offer any support” to Russia in the war.  “From the early 1990s, at the Budapest Memorandum and for all the agreements reached since then, China has always kept its commitments. I personally hope that the international community will join together to support my 10-point peace plan, where American, Chinese and major power guarantees to defend world security are covered,” Zelensky told the newspaper.   The Ukrainian president said that Ukraine’s relationship with China has always been “very good.”  “We have had intense economic relations for many years, and it is in everyone's interest that they do not change. The global challenge is to thwart any risk of nuclear conflict,” he continued.   On Sunday, the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told CBS' ""Face the Nation"" program that Washington is concerned that China is considering providing “lethal support” to Russia’s war in Ukraine.    The United States along with more than 30 other countries including Canada and most of Europe are backing a proposed ban of Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing in international sports, according to a joint statement published by the British government Monday.  The countries asked the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to reverse its decision last month to create a pathway for Russian and Belarussian athletes to participate in the upcoming Games as “neutral athletes.""  “The situation in Ukraine has continued to deteriorate since the IOC barred Russian and Belarusian athletes last year – following their nations’ violation of the Olympic truce – and there is no reason for the IOC to reverse that decision,” according to the UK government summary of the statement. “There are serious concerns about how feasible it is for Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete on a neutral basis given they are directly funded and supported by their states. As long as a workable ‘neutrality’ model is not set out in detail, Russian and Belarusian athletes should not be allowed back into competition,"" it added. The statement went on to say that “there are clear concerns over the strong links and affiliations between Russian athletes and the Russian military,"" demanding that the IOC must address the questions identified by all countries and reconsider its proposal. The statement is signed by sport and culture ministers of the US, Canada, UK, Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden.   Here's what the US previously said: Earlier this month, the White House said it did not object to allowing athletes from Russia or Belarus from taking part in the 2024 Summer Games and 2026 Winter Games — as long as it is ""absolutely clear"" that they are not representing their home countries, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. ""In cases where sports organizations and event organizers, such as the International Olympic Committee, choose to permit athletes from Russia and Belarus to participate in supporting events, it should be absolutely clear that they are not representing the Russian or Belarusian states,"" Jean-Pierre said, adding that the use of any official Russian or Belarusian flags, emblems or anthems should be prohibited. No one knows how the war in Ukraine will end, but “there is no sign"" that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""has changed his ambitions"" as the invasion approaches the one-year mark this week, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said. “We see the opposite. He’s not planning for peace. He’s planning for more war,” he told CNN at the Munich Security Conference. “They are launching offensive operations already,” the NATO chief said, pointing to fighting in eastern Ukraine, specifically the city of Bakhmut. ""Whether this is the big spring offensive or whether it’s just a kind of prelude to that, it’s a bit hard to tell. But they are pouring in more and more troops and more and more weapons,"" he added. Stoltenberg said Russia is trying to make up for poor equipment and logistics with more troops, something he described as ""throwing just waves of people on the defensive lines,"" a type of fighting that hasn't been seen since World War I. “If you don’t care so much about human lives then you just throw in more and more,"" he said. Stoltenberg said while how the conflict will end is unclear, what he is sure of is the importance of western military support for Ukraine.  “If you want Ukraine to prevail as a sovereign nation and if you want a peaceful negotiated solution tomorrow, then you need to provide military support today,” he said, adding that the effectiveness of negotiations for Ukraine depends on ""strength on the battlefield."" Portugal is ready to send three Leopard 2 A6 combat tanks to Ukraine in March, Portugal's defense ministry said in a statement earlier this month. The decision was made within the framework of ongoing contacts with allies and partners, the ministry said on February 8.  Some background: Several countries have offered to give tanks to Ukraine, though not all have confirmed how many they plan to send. Much of southern and eastern Ukraine, where much of the heavy fighting is happening, is ideal terrain for combinations of modern Western tanks and armored fighting vehicles to spearhead a counteroffensive. Additionally, Leopard 2s, Abrams and British Challengers all carry heavy machine guns, which would devastate infantry in open land. Another advantage of the Leopard 2, the tanks Portugal among other countries are planning to send, is that the ammunition for its 120 mm gun is widely available among NATO armies. Cloaked in secrecy and weighted with history, US President Joe Biden’s trip to Ukraine was the work of months of planning by only a small handful of his senior-most aides, who recognized long ago the symbolic importance of visiting the Ukrainian capital a year after Russia tried to capture it. One year later, Kyiv stands,” Biden declared Monday during the visit. “And Ukraine stands. Democracy stands.” A secret until the last minute: Keeping Biden’s plans secret required extraordinary measures on the part of the White House. In the weeks leading up to Biden’s travel, he and top aides repeatedly shot down the possibility of a trip to Ukraine. Every effort was made to maintain that position in the hour leading up to Biden’s surprise arrival in Kyiv. That was in part due to the fluid nature of the trip itself. Even as the small circle of White House officials looped in on the planning grew confident it was an achievable undertaking, the realities of sending a president into a war zone where the US had no control over the air space were daunting. The final decision was made in an Oval Office meeting on Friday evening, when Biden gave the final green light. Once the trip was on, US officials took steps to notify Moscow of their plans, an attempt at “deconfliction” meant to avoid unthinkable disaster while Biden was on the ground. A 10-hour train ride through Ukraine: There would be a stop to refuel at a US base in Germany before continuing the flight into Poland. As he jetted eastward, Biden’s focus was plotting out his conversations with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, hoping to use his limited time wisely in discussing the coming months of fighting. Biden landed in Rzeszow, the Polish town where he’d stopped in March of last year to visit US troops deployed near the Ukrainian border and humanitarian efforts supporting Ukrainian refugees. During that visit 11 months ago, he alluded to what became a long-running desire to extend his journey just a little further into Ukraine. This time around, with an expanded set of US air assets overhead keeping close watch at the Polish border, he would make the trip. Biden, his small contingent of advisers and Secret Service that traveled with him boarded the train to Kyiv for the roughly 10-hour trip to the center of the war-torn country. It was the culmination of a process that began months earlier, as Biden watched as a parade of his foreign counterparts each made the journey into Ukraine. Calculated risk: As Biden was briefed over several months on the planning for a potential visit, the person said that Biden only once expressed concern about the risk of a visit to Ukraine — but that was about the extent to which his visit could endanger others, rather than about his own safety. Other officials were extremely concerned about Biden’s own safety and prepared a series of security contingency plans for the trip. “This was a risk that Joe Biden wanted to take,” said White House communications director Kate Bedingfield. “It’s important to him to show up, even when it’s hard, and he directed his team to make it happen, no matter how challenging the logistics.” Read more about Biden's historic trip here.  CNN’s Jeremy Diamond contributed reporting to this post.  ##Biden## US President Joe Biden made an unprecedented trip to Kyiv Monday for the first time since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine almost a year ago.  Biden walked alongside President Volodymyr Zelensky around the gold-domed St. Michael’s Cathedral as air raid sirens could be heard ringing out around Kyiv. The US president announced a half-billion dollars of additional assistance to Ukraine and incoming sanctions against Moscow as he vowed to continue to support Kyiv. Zelensky praised Biden's visit, saying it leaves Ukraine ""closer to victory."" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Biden was intently focused on discussing the coming months of fighting when he sat down with Zelensky. Their talks come at what Sullivan called a ""critical juncture"" in the war, as Russia prepares for a spring offensive and as Ukraine hopes to retake territory seized over the past 12 months. Biden’s surprise visit to Ukraine also came just ahead of his scheduled trip to Poland later on Monday. Marchin Przydacz, a top advisor to Polish President Andrzej Duda, told CNN that Biden's visit to Kyiv is a “clear sign” of American commitment to supporting Ukraine.  Here are more of the latest headlines on the Russia-Ukraine war: Ukraine prepares for possible Russian provocations around war anniversary: The Ukrainian military will be ""ready"" to respond to any possible ""provocative actions"" by Russia around the anniversary of the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Yurii Ihnat, spokesperson for the Ukrainian Air Force Command, told CNN on Monday. The official didn't elaborate on any possible specific threats, but said if the Russians engage in some sort of ""provocative actions"" on February 23, 24 or 25, the Ukrainian Air Force is ""on stand-by 24/7, our job is to be ready at all times. ""Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. February 23 is celebrated in Russia as Defender of the Fatherland Day.
Donetsk under constant enemy shelling, official says: Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region has been under ""constant"" shelling by Russian forces, the head of Donetsk regional military administration, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said in a telegram post on Monday. One person was killed and two others were injured due to Russian shelling in the village of Ivanopillia near the town of Kostiantynivka, he said. Russian forces struck other villages in the region with rockets and artillery, he said. CNN has not been able to independently verify those claims.  Pro-Russian military bloggers criticize Moscow over Biden visit to Kyiv: Pro-Russian military bloggers and journalists have criticized the Kremlin for not being able to prevent Biden from visiting Kyiv. Russian army veteran and former Federal Security Service (FSB) officer Igor Girkin said Biden could be taken all the way to Bakhmut and nothing would happen to him. Russian Journalist Sergey Mardan struck a stronger tone, calling Biden’s visit a “Demonstrative humiliation of Russia.”
Kyiv mayor says Ukraine still needs modern weapons: Biden's surprise visit to Ukraine was an ""important"" and ""symbolic"" visit, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko told CNN's Poppy Harlow on Monday. “It’s a risky trip, it’s a tough decision, but it’s very important and it has symbolism... it shows the whole world that the United States supports Ukraine,"" he said. He added that Ukrainian soldiers have already shown the world their “will and spirit,” but this is not enough. “It's very important (to have) modern weapons... to be honest we depend (on the) help of our partners,” Klitschko said.
German arms maker expects ammunition for anti-aircraft tanks to be delivered to Ukraine by July: CEO Armin Papperger made the commitment while speaking to journalists with German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius after the two visited the manufacturing site of the tanks in Unterluess, in western Germany. The influential Rheinmetall CEO also announced that twenty Marder fighting vehicles will be ready to be delivered to Ukraine by the end of March.   ##Biden## ##Catch Up## After nearly a year of war and fighting for their sovereignty against Russia, Maryan Zablotskiy, a member of the Ukrainian parliament, said US President Joe Biden’s visit to the country’s capital Monday was “spiritually uplifting.” He said there have been rumors of a new offensive from Russia and increased shelling but to see both presidents in Kyiv ""under the active air raid alarm"" was ""a message to Putin"" that they're in the range of his missiles and he can't ""do anything about it because we're much stronger."" The last few months of the war have been difficult, Zablotskiy told CNN. He said many Ukrainians have lost friends in the conflict, but Biden’s visit was a show of united strength.  “The main thing is what will be the end result and with President Biden's visit and with this show of strength, we know that in the end, we will be victorious. That was very powerful for us,” he said. ##Biden## German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told the Chinese delegation at the Munich Security Conference last week that they are “responsible for world peace” and that Beijing must “not supply Russia with any weapons,” she said on Monday.   “I made it clear that China in particular, as a member of the Security Council, is responsible for world peace in the situation we are currently experiencing with the Russian war of aggression, which is also a breach of international law,” Baerbock said Monday after an EU meeting in Brussels.  “This also means that China must not supply Russia with any weapons, including dual-use goods,” she added.  On Sunday, the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told CBS' ""Face the Nation"" program that the US is concerned that China is considering providing “lethal support” to Russia’s war in Ukraine.  Blinken met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Saturday in the first face-to-face meeting between senior US and Chinese officials since Blinken postponed his trip to China earlier this month.  While Blinken and Wang’s talks centered on the balloon saga, a senior State Department official told reporters Blinken was “quite blunt in warning about the implications and consequences of China providing material support to Russia or assisting Russia with systematic sanctions evasion” during his meeting with China’s top diplomat.  Some background: As CNN previously reported, the Biden administration last month raised concerns with China about evidence it has suggesting that Chinese companies have sold non-lethal equipment to Russia for use in Ukraine, in an effort to ascertain how much Beijing knows about the transactions, according to two US officials. That equipment has included items like flak jackets and helmets, multiple sources familiar with US and European intelligence told CNN. But China has stopped short of the more robust military assistance, like lethal weapons systems for use on the battlefield in Ukraine, that Russia has requested because it has not wanted to be seen as a pariah on the world stage, officials said. CNN's Sam Fossum, Aaron Pellish and Natasha Bertrand contributed to this post.  Germany’s largest arms manufacturer Rheinmetall expects the first batch of ammunition for anti-aircraft Gepard systems will be delivered to Ukraine by July, CEO Armin Papperger said on Monday.   Papperger made the commitment while speaking to journalists with German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius after the two visited the manufacturing site of the tanks in Unterluess, in western Germany.   The influential Rheinmetall CEO also announced that twenty Marder fighting vehicles will be ready to be delivered to Ukraine by the end of March.   In response to Pistorius' appeal to arms manufacturers to fire up ammunition production, Papperger said his company had “doubled capacities, in some sectors even tripled them.“  “In weapons production, the warehouse is full, we are running at full steam here and we can still increase capacity with one shift,“ if contracts were made, he said.   Pistorius said the German government was working with the industry to deliver whatever was possible.   “We can deliver what we have and we can deliver what will be produced in the next months,“ he added.  The German defense minister on Monday also visited members of the Ukrainian military learning to operate Leopard tanks and Marder infantry fighting vehicles in Germany’s Munster.   The production of a modern battle tank takes “about two to two and a half years” from the time it is ordered, Pistorius said during the visit.   “Everything we are handing over now (to Ukraine) will only be available for replacement in two or two-and-a-half years,“ he added. President Joe Biden’s surprise visit to Ukraine sparked anger and embarrassment among many of Russia’s hawkish military pundits on Monday, increasing pressure on Vladimir Putin as the Russian leader prepares to justify his stuttering invasion in a national address. Biden’s historic visit came days before the one-year anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, providing a symbolic boost to Kyiv at a crucial juncture in the conflict. But the visit caused fury in Russian pro-military and ultranationalist circles, as it upstages Putin on the eve of a major address in which the Russian president is expected to tout the supposed achievements of what he euphemistically calls a “special military operation.” Here's what the Russian pundits are saying about Biden's trip: Russian journalist Sergey Mardan wrote in a snarky response on his Telegram channel: “Biden in [Kyiv]. Demonstrative humiliation of Russia ... Tales of miraculous hypersonics may be left for children. Just like spells about the holy war we are waging with the entire West.” He added, “I guess there are lunch breaks in a holy war.""
Russian army veteran and former Federal Security Service (FSB) officer Igor Girkin meanwhile suggested that Biden could have visited the frontlines in eastern Ukraine and escaped unharmed. “Wouldn’t be surprised if the grandfather (he is not good for anything but simple provocations anyway) is brought to Bakhmut as well… AND NOTHING WILL HAPPEN TO HIM,” Girkin said. Girkin is among a number of hardline military bloggers who have repeatedly criticized what they consider a “soft” approach on the battlefield by Putin’s generals.
A Telegram account managed by Russian army and naval servicemembers, Zapiski michmana Ptichkina, noted ironically that Biden had reached Kyiv before Russian President Vladimir Putin. “Almost a year after the beginning of the Special military operation, we are waiting in the Russian city of [Kyiv] for the president of the Russian Federation, but not for the [President of the] United States,” it said. Read more about this here ##Biden## The Ukrainian military will be ""ready"" to respond to any possible ""provocative actions"" by Russia around the anniversary of the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Yurii Ihnat, spokesperson for the Ukrainian Air Force Command, told CNN on Monday.

Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. February 23 is celebrated in Russia as Defender of the Fatherland Day. Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda on Monday urged the West to cross ""red lines"" to deliver the military aid Ukraine needs.  “This is very important that we cross these red lines, which are in our minds and do not reality really exist. Maybe sometimes Russia tries to set up those red lines instead of us,” he said in an interview with CNN’s Julia Chatterley.  “My message is: Not waste the time. Be decisive, be united and take decisions as quick as possible,” Nauseda added.   He said that US President Joe Biden’s visit to Kyiv on Monday shows Ukraine won’t be abandoned and sends a very strong message of unity among Ukraine's allies.   When asked what message he will take to Biden during their upcoming meeting in Warsaw, the Lithuanian leader said that he would discuss with the US leader about Lithuania’s security and “especially the security of eastern flank."" The president added that Baltic nations are exposed to “direct threats” from Russia and Belarus. “This is the reason we expect some positive signals regarding our security,” he said.   Biden, during his visit to Poland this week, is expected to meet with leaders of the “Bucharest Nine,” the group of Eastern flank NATO allies – Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. When asked about his response to the Chinese foreign minister recently saying Beijing is ready to present its peace proposition for Ukraine, Nauseda said that China should not interfere in the war.   More on China-Russia relations: As Biden touched down in Ukraine to meet with his counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky, China’s top diplomat was traveling to Russia. The trip came as the US has recently begun seeing “disturbing” trendlines in China’s support for Russia’s military and there are signs that Beijing wants to “creep up to the line” of providing lethal military aid to Russia without getting caught, US officials familiar with the intelligence told CNN. CNN's Natasha Bertrand contributed reporting to this post.  Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region has been under ""constant"" shelling by Russian forces, the head of Donetsk regional military administration, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said in a telegram post on Monday.  One person was killed and two others were injured due to Russian shelling in the village of Ivanopillia near the town of Kostiantynivka, he said.  Russian forces struck other villages in the region with rockets and artillery, he said. CNN has not been able to independently verify those claims.  Residential buildings, a school, cars, shops, cafes and industrial facilities were destroyed or damaged, Kyrylenko said.  The Donetsk region has seen some of the most intense fighting in recent days and weeks. Last week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the situation in the eastern city of Bakhmut is ""the most difficult out of all"" areas in Ukraine.  Here's where things stand on the ground:  Amanda Sloat, the senior director for Europe at the National Security Council, told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins that US President Joe Biden felt “it was symbolically important for him to make the trip to Ukraine, to stand side-by-side with President Zelenskyy and present US support” for Kyiv, especially ahead of the one-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion.  Sloat said that “the top concern is security,"" and that Biden ""has been very clear that he’s long wanted to go to Ukraine. Ukraine’s had a very special place in his heart, including from back when he was Vice President.” “The team, obviously, was taking a very close look at all of the security risks involved and the President ultimately decided it was a calculated risk and one that he was prepared to take,” Sloat explained. When asked about proposals to have the allied countries train Ukrainians on F-16 fighter jets ahead of potential future transfers, Sloat said that NSC has been ""focused on providing the near-term capabilities that the Ukrainians need in terms of their ground offensive.”  Sloat also said both presidents ""had the opportunity to exchange perspectives on security assistance,” which she called a “good discussion.” She also acknowledged that Russia was notified of Biden's arrival in Ukraine, saying that a notification to the Russians was sent ""several hours before the president left, primarily for deconfliction purposes."" “I’m not going to try to get into the mind of President Putin,” Sloat said when asked if she anticipates Biden’s surprise Kyiv trip will alter Putin’s planned speech to mark the year anniversary. She said she believes Biden’s speech in Poland “will also be historic.” Sloat characterized US-Poland relations as “extremely strong” and said “Poland has really stepped up” in supporting Ukraine over the past year. Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev dismissed US President Joe Biden's visit to Kyiv Monday, accusing the US of warmongering support for Ukraine. ""Biden, having received security guarantees in advance, finally went to Kyiv,"" Medvedev said in a statement on Telegram. ""And of course, there were mutual incantations about the victory that would come with new weapons and a courageous people. And here it is important to note that the West already delivers weapons and money to Kyiv quite regularly. In huge quantities, allowing the military-industrial complex of NATO countries to earn money and steal weapons to sell to terrorists around the world."" More on the former president: Medvedev, who currently serves as deputy head of Russia's Security Council, is known for making belligerent pronouncements in an apparent bid to shore up his nationalist credentials.  While Biden's public schedule didn't reflect his trip to Ukraine Monday, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Washington informed Moscow of Biden's plans to visit the Ukrainian capital for ""deconfliction purposes"" a few hours prior to his departure.  ##Biden## Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the Russian private military company Wagner, acknowledged Monday a ""major problem"" with ammunition supplies for his troops, amid a public spat with the leaders of Russia's defense establishment.  “The issues that I raised about ammunition, unfortunately, remain unresolved,"" Prigozhin said in an emotional audio shared by his team on his official Telegram channel. ""And this is a major problem.“ Prigozhin believes there is enough ammunition supply in Russia, as “the industry has reached the required levels” and can provide for the country’s needs but said he “can’t solve this problem despite all of my acquaintances and connections.” Prigozhin claimed he has been told he needs to “go and apologize” to someone ""high up"" who he has a “difficult relationship with” to resolve the issue, but added he does not know who that is. “Who should I apologize to? Who should I bow down to? 140 million Russians! Please tell me who I should bow down to so that my guys die two times less than they are [dying] today,” he said. “Today, twice as many fighters of PMC Wagner and other military units that we cannot cover die every day due to total shell hunger when we’re not allowed to use what there is in warehouses."" CNN cannot independently verify Prigozhin's claims of an ammunition shortage. The chief, who has no official position, has been unusually public in his criticism of some of Russian President Vladimir Putin's generals.   More background: According to Prigozhin, Wagner did not experience such problems with ammunition when Gen. Sergei Surovikin commanded Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Surovikin was replaced by Gen. Valery Gerasimov in January. “Those who prevent us from winning this war are directly working for the enemy,” he claimed. In January, Russia’s Defense Ministry announced another reshuffle of the commanders leading the war in Ukraine, amid mounting criticism over its handling of the military operations in Ukraine. Prigozhin has praised Gen. Surovikin for managing an orderly withdrawal of Russian forces in the southern Kherson region last year but has been critical of the larger handling by the Ministry of Defense and other top Russian generals of what Russia calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine. US President Joe Biden was intently focused on discussing the coming months of fighting when he sat down with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv on Monday, according to White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan. Their talks come at what Sullivan called a ""critical juncture"" in the war, as Russia prepares for a spring offensive and as Ukraine hopes to retake territory seized over the past 12 months. The US has hoped to help Ukraine consolidate its battlefield gains, sending steady shipments of arms and ammunition. But what lies ahead remains uncertain, as Russia appears to be regrouping. As Biden flew from Washington to Europe, he was intent on strategizing on how to make the most of his conversation with Zelensky. ""The President was very focused on making sure that he made the most of his time on the ground, which he knew was going to be limited,"" Sullivan said. ""So he was quite focused on how he was going to approach his conversation with President Zelensky and in part how the two of them were really going to look out over the course of 2023 and try to come to a common understanding of what the objectives are."" In their talks, the two leaders ""spent time talking about the coming months in terms of the battlefield and what Ukraine need capabilities to be able to succeed on the battlefield,"" Sullivan said. ""They talked about Ukraine's needs in terms of energy, infrastructure, economic support humanitarian needs. And they also talked about the political side of this,"" he said. Biden was “excited” as made his surprise trip to Ukraine on Monday, a journey Sullivan described as “filled with real anticipation that this was an important moment.” Sullivan said Biden “wanted to do it, characteristically, by delving into the details by knowing the specifics and by being sure that he was going to make the most of every moment.” Asked if Biden had to overrule anyone on his security team to make the trip, Sullivan declined to get into details of the discussions but said that “the president proceeded with the confidence that his security team was able to bring risk to a manageable level.” White House officials also would not go into details about the logistics of the president’s trip, saying that more details would come once they “got the green light from the security folks.” Jailed Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny and his team published a detailed statement on their website Monday outlining what Navalny called is his political platform, ahead of the one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. As part of the platform, which he summarized in 15 points, Navalny calls for the restoration of national borders as defined in 1991 and for returning Crimea to Ukraine. Navalny also called for paying reparations to Ukraine. “Let me re-emphasize that we will have to reimburse Ukraine for all the damage caused by Putin's aggression after the war,” Navalny said in the statement.  “However, the restoration of normal economic relations with the civilized world and the return of economic growth will allow us to do so without interfering with the development of our country,” he said.  According to Navalny, ""Russia is suffering a military defeat"" in Ukraine and ""it was the realization of this fact that changed the rhetoric of the authorities from claims that 'Kyiv will fall in three days' to hysterical threats of using nuclear weapons should Russia lose,"" he claimed.  ""The lives of tens of thousands of Russian soldiers have been senselessly ruined,"" Navalny said. ""The final military defeat can be delayed at the cost of the lives of hundreds of thousands [of] additional reservists, but on the whole, it is inevitable,"" he said. King Charles III on Monday met with Ukrainian military recruits undertaking training by British and international forces in the South West of England.  The five-week mission “delivers basic combat training over five weeks to Ukrainian recruits who will return to fight in Ukraine,” according to a statement from Buckingham Palace. Accompanied by British Chief of General Staff General Sir Patrick Sanders, King Charles also met with international military personnel “who have joined forces with the British Army,” to deliver training for Ukrainians in other areas of Britain, the statement said.  While top congressional leaders have yet to weigh in on the visit, some House Republicans are criticizing President Joe Biden’s trip to Ukraine and his renewed support for Ukraine’s defense against Russia’s invasion, undercutting Biden’s message of bipartisan support for Ukraine.  In a surprise visit to Ukraine ahead of the one-year anniversary of the war between Ukraine and Russia, Biden met with Ukraine's President Zelensky and emphasized broad, bipartisan support from members of Congress for Ukraine’s war effort.  ""For all the disagreement we have in our Congress on some issues, there is significant agreement on support for Ukraine,"" Biden said.  But some House Republicans are subverting that bipartisanship in reactions to Biden’s trip on social media. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene called Biden’s trip “incredibly insulting” and said his visit demonstrates an “America Last” policy.  “This is incredibly insulting. Today on our President’s Day, Joe Biden, the President of the United States chose Ukraine over America, while forcing the American people to pay for Ukraine’s government and war. I can not express how much Americans hate Joe Biden,” Greene said in a tweet.  Greene was one of 11 House Republicans who co-sponsored a “Ukraine Fatigue” resolution earlier this month. The resolution called for suspending military and financial aid to Ukraine.  Other House Republicans used Biden’s trip to criticize Biden for prioritizing Ukraine’s defense over domestic policy issues like immigration.  “Breathtaking that President Biden can show up in Ukraine to ensure their border is secure, but can’t do the same for America,” Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Scott Perry said in a tweet.  “So it takes two years for Joe Biden @POTUS to visit the war zone he created at our southern border, but then he goes to see another war zone he created in Ukraine,” North Carolina Republican Rep. Greg Murphy said in a tweet.  Despite the criticism from some House Republicans, others have urged President Biden to increase support for Ukraine. House Foreign Affairs Chairman Rep. Mike McCaul said on CNN’s State of the Union in an interview that aired Sunday that bipartisan support for Ukraine is “still very strong” and called on the Biden administration to increase support to avoid a “long, protracted war.”  Upon arriving in Ukraine, Biden announced $500 million of additional assistance to Ukraine.  ##Biden## The visit of US President Joe Biden to Ukraine Monday is a “clear sign” of American commitment to supporting Ukraine, Marchin Przydacz, a top advisor to Polish President Andrzej Duda, told CNN on Monday.  “We welcome very much his brave decision to go to Ukraine as a clear sign of US commitment and his personal engagement in the situation, sending a clear signal that the US is with its allies, its partners, and that there is a belief that Ukraine can be victorious in this difficult situation,” told CNN’s Kaitlin Collins.  Biden’s surprise visit to Ukraine came just ahead of his scheduled visit to Poland later on Monday. Przydacz said he is “looking forward to see him on Polish land."" ##Biden## US President Joe Biden was presented with a range of options for a visit to Ukraine, but decided that a trip to Kyiv made the most sense, a source familiar with the matter said. The president never seriously considered any other options other than the capital for his visit to Ukraine, the source said. If he was going to go to Ukraine, he wanted to go to the capital. Biden was presented with other options for a visit elsewhere in Ukraine over the course of months of meticulous planning, but this source said that Biden ultimately determined that a visit to Kyiv made the most sense from a risk-reward standpoint. As Biden was briefed over several months on the planning for a potential visit, the source said Biden only once expressed concern about the risk of a visit to Ukraine — but that was about the extent to which his visit could endanger others, rather than about his own safety. Other officials were obviously extremely concerned about Biden's safety and prepared a series of security contingency plans. In response to a question from CNN, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan declined to say whether Biden had to overrule Secret Service or military officials in order to proceed with a trip to Kyiv. ""He got a full presentation of a very good and very effective operational security plan. He heard that presentation, he was satisfied that the risk was manageable and he ultimately made a determination (to go),"" Sullivan said. ##Biden## Pro-Russian military bloggers and journalists have criticized the Kremlin for not being able to prevent US President Joe Biden from visiting the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. Russian army veteran and former Federal Security Service (FSB) officer Igor Girkin said Biden could be taken all the way to Bakhmut and nothing would happen to him.  “Wouldn't be surprised if the grandfather (he is not good for anything but simple provocations anyway) is brought to Bakhmut as well... AND NOTHING WILL HAPPEN TO HIM,” Girkin noted, ironically.  Girkin has been critical of the Kremlin and the Russian Ministry of Defense for what he considers a “soft” approach toward Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.  Russian Journalist Sergey Mardan struck a stronger tone, calling Biden’s visit a “Demonstrative humiliation of Russa.” “Biden in Kiev (Russian spelling). Demonstrative humiliation of Russia,” Russian journalist Sergey Mardan wrote on his telegram channel. “Tales of miraculous hypersonics may be left for children. Just like spells about the holy war we are waging with the entire West.”  “I guess there are lunch breaks in a holy war,” he added.  A Telegram account managed by the Russian army and naval service members, Zapiski michmana Ptichkina, noted ironically that Biden had reached Kyiv before Russian President Vladimir Putin. “Almost a year after the beginning of the Special military operation, we are waiting in the Russian city of Kiev for the president of the Russian Federation, but not for the [President of the] United States."" There were others who were less critical. Russia Military correspondent Yuri Kotenok claimed the air raid siren that rang out while Zelensky and Biden exited St. Michael's Cathedral was a “sham,” while Boris Rozhin from the Center for Military-Political Journalism said Biden only visited because he was given assurances no one would shoot at him.  “It is worth recalling that US presidents visited their puppets in Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan. We know how it ended for the United States,” Rozhin added.  ##Biden## US President Joe Biden only decided on Friday to go ahead with a high-stakes, high-risk visit to Kyiv after huddling with top members of his national security team in the Oval Office. A few hours before he departed, the United States informed Russia of the plans to visit the Ukrainian capital for ""deconfliction purposes,"" according to Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan. The Friday session in the Oval Office was the culmination of months of work by a tiny handful of Biden's top aides to plan the trip around the anniversary of the start of the war. The planning included the chief of staff's office, the National Security Council and the White House Military Office, with input from a small number of officials at the US Secret Service, the Pentagon and the Intelligence Community, according to deputy national security adviser Jon Finer. Biden was regularly briefed on the plans for the trip, including threat assessments, as the visit came together.  Discussions between the White House and the ""highest levels of the Ukrainian government"" helped bring the trip over the finish line. ""He was satisfied the risk was manageable,"" Sullivan said. ""This was risk that Joe Biden wanted to take,"" said communications director Kate Bedingfield. ""It's important to him to show up, even when it's hard, and he directed his team to make it happen no matter how challenging the logistics."" ##Biden## US President Joe Biden's surprise visit to Ukraine on Monday was an ""important"" and ""symbolic"" visit, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko told CNN's Poppy Harlow on Monday.  “It’s a risky trip, it’s a tough decision, but it’s very important and it has symbolism... it shows the whole world that the United States supports Ukraine,"" he said. ""It gives us much more energy to fight if we feel our friends behind us, it’s a very important message,"" said the mayor.  Biden announced an additional half-billion dollars of assistance during his trip, including more ammunition and howitzers but it did not include anything new such as longer range missiles or fighter jets.  Ukrainian soldiers … have been fighting already (for) one year against one of strongest army in the world: the Russian army,” said Klitschko.  He added that Ukrainian soldiers have already shown the world their “will and spirit,” but this is not enough.  “It's very important (to have) modern weapons... to be honest we depend (on the) help of our partners,” Klitschko said. ##Biden## Residents of Kyiv welcomed US President Joe Biden’s visit to Ukraine's capital, saying his presence in the country is meaningful. “That really impressed me. He's good, I wasn't expecting his visit. I'm sure his visit means a lot,” 40-year-old Yuliya Ivanova said.  “Biden will be able to look at the situation in Ukraine from the inside, he will be able to talk to a lot of representatives of our government. He will look and see how difficult it is for us. I think we will be able to count on more US help.” Tetyana Yevtushenko, a 30-year-old doctor, also said Ukrainians were grateful for the President’s visit. “We hope it will give us support,"" she said. “It's just something unbelievable that at a time like this the President of the United States is coming to Kyiv,” 48-year-old Ukrainian service-member Andrei Ketov added. “I think this visit will bring us 'carrots,' something good, we are having a very hard time right now.” “We need weapons and finances. We don't have our own. And the Russians have a lot of everything,” he added. Student Vitaly Dmyterchuk, 19, described the visit as “a very memorable day.” “We argued among ourselves whether Biden would come or not. I didn't believe he was coming,"" he said. ""This is a huge support for us, we know that in America we have a lot of support and help."" “And so there is a great flow of weapons and humanitarian aid ... But there hasn't been such a large-scale war since World War II. And sometimes that aid is not enough. I know how soldiers on the front line suffer.” Ilya Zelenko, a 20-year-old student, added: “I was very happy when I found out that Biden came, we expect even more support. Now we see a coalition around Ukraine, we want to see it strengthened, and (that) we (are) given even more weapons.”  ##Biden## Students from Ukraine’s northeastern city of Kharkiv had traveled to Kyiv on Monday for a memorial day commemorating those who lost their lives in the 2014 Maidan Revolution, CNN's Clarissa Ward told This Morning’s Poppy Harlow and Sara Sidner. The students were looking at the wreaths placed at a wall outside the city's St. Michael's Church where Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and US counterpart Joe Biden paid their respects just moments before.  The students were saying how excited they were that Biden had visited the country, but hope this follows with military support, Ward reported.  Ward is in Kyiv for the one-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, on February 24. Then there were concerns that the capital would fall to Russian forces in days, if not weeks.  Almost one year later, Ward said: “Not only did Kyiv not fall, Kyiv is bustling, Kyiv is buzzing.” “Let me tell you now Poppy, you can’t get a seat in a restaurant without a reservation here,” she added.  Ward added that, although this may not be indicative of what the rest of the country looks like, it is nevertheless ""extraordinary"" to witness how the capital has come to embody the country’s ""defiance and resilience"" in the face of Russian attacks.  ##Biden## President Joe Biden paid tribute to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s “courage and leadership” in a message written on the guestbook at Mariinsky Palace, the official residence of the President of Ukraine. ""I am honored to be welcomed again in Kyiv to stand in solidarity and friendship with the freedom loving people of Ukraine Mr President,” Biden wrote, according to a picture taken by Vice Prime Minister for the Restoration of Ukraine Oleksandr Kubrakov.  “Please accept my deepest respect for your courage and leadership. Slava Ukraini! (Glory to Ukraine). Joe Biden."" ##Biden## President Joe Biden has now departed Ukraine's capital, according to reporters traveling with him, concluding a historic visit. He arrived around 8 a.m. local time (1 a.m. ET) and met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, before walking around central Kyiv and pledging the US' continued support for Ukraine. ##Biden## Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said negotiations between his and US President Joe Biden’s teams in Kyiv were a major boost to his country. “This conversation brings us closer to victory,” Zelensky said, speaking alongside Biden on Monday. The results of this visit will surely be seen, and will surely have repercussions on the battlefield in liberating our territories,” he added. The Ukrainian leader also called Biden's surprise visit the most important in the “history of the Ukraine-US relationship.” “Ukrainians remember the focus, attention, the attitude that President Biden and the US have given to Ukraine,” Zelensky added. “I thank you for this level of US-Ukraine cooperation,” he said. Zelensky said he had discussed the supply of more advanced Western weapons to Ukraine, and cited the recent decision by the US to send Abrams tanks to the country as another defining moment.   “The decision of the US on Abrams tanks has already presented a foundation for establishing a tank coalition and is of historic importance,” he said. “We’ve also talked about long-range weapons and the weapons that may still be supplied to Ukraine – even though have not been supplied before.” ##Biden## As traffic stood still in Kyiv on Monday morning, rumors were flying. The talk of the town: a high-profile visitor is on the way. Nobody knew for sure who the VIP might be, but security preparations suggested it was a top-level visit; perhaps the highest level of all. Multiple streets in the city center were shut down by police and the military presence was unusually high early on Monday, even for the capital city of a war-torn country. The roads around St. Michael’s Golden-Domed Monastery in the heart of Kyiv were cleared overnight and sealed off early in the morning, causing traffic jams in the surrounding streets. The plaza outside the church has become a popular spot for foreign dignitaries visiting the capital. Destroyed Russian tanks are on display there, next to a statue that’s been wrapped in sandbags to protect if from explosions.  Guests at the hotel overlooking the square were told photographing and filming was off the limits for the morning. They were warned internet connection and cellphone signal may be disrupted. By now, the city is used to high-profile visitors, with a string of political leaders traveling there in recent months. But even so, the level of security — and excitement — in Kyiv were a clear indication that something significant was planned. Then, at around noon local time, it was announced: US President Joe Biden was in the country. He joined Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky on a walkabout in Kyiv just as air raid sirens sounded across the city. Biden had arrived a few hours before, after completing a secret flight under cover of darkness. ##Biden## US President Joe Biden made an unannounced trip to Kyiv early Monday for the first time since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine almost a year ago. Biden arrived in Kyiv at 8 a.m. local time (1:00 a.m. ET), according to reporters traveling with him inside the country, and was greeted by the US Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink. His motorcade arrived at the Mariinsky Palace just after 8:30 a.m. local time. He was greeted by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his wife, Olena Zelenska. “Thank you for coming,” Zelensky said, shaking Biden’s hand. The pictures below show Biden's meeting with Zelensky, which took place as air raid sirens could be heard ringing out while the two leaders walked around the city. Here's a look:  ##Biden## US President Joe Biden declared from Kyiv on Monday that a year after invading Ukraine, ""Putin’s war of conquest is failing."" “Putin thought Ukraine was weak and the West was divided,” Biden said standing alongside Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky. “He thought he could outlast us. I don’t think he’s thinking that right now.” “He’s just been plain wrong,” Biden said of Putin. “One year later, the evidence is right here in this room. We stand here together.” Biden's visit to Ukraine, his first since the invasion, was a highly symbolic moment meant to demonstrate lasting American support for the country and its people. He harkened back to the start of the war, when the world was anxiously watching the buildup of Russian troops along Ukraine's border. In his speech, Biden recalled how he and Zelensky spoke by phone as “Russian planes were in the air and tanks were going across your border.” “You told me that you could hear explosions in the background,” Biden said. “I’ll never forget that.” “The world was about to change,"" he said, recalling what Zelensky asked him to do on that phone call: “Gather the leaders of the world. Ask them to support Ukraine.” “You said that you didn’t know when we’d be able to speak again. That dark night one year ago, the world was literally at the time bracing for the fall of Kyiv,” Biden said. “Perhaps even the end of Ukraine.” “One year later, Kyiv stands. And Ukraine stands. Democracy stands,” he declared. “The Americans stand with you and the world stands with you.” Biden said that Kyiv has “captured a part of my heart."" ##Biden## President Biden's trip to Kyiv on Monday was shrouded in secrecy, a reflection of the steep security concerns of visiting an active war zone. Air Force One departed Joint Base Andrews under cover of darkness at 4:15 a.m. ET on Sunday. Reporters aboard the plane were not allowed to carry their devices with them. Biden's public schedule didn't reflect the trip, and White House officials repeatedly said last week that a visit to Ukraine was not in the works.  On Saturday evening, before he departed, Biden went out to dinner with his wife in Washington. He wasn't seen in public again until arriving in Kyiv on Monday morning. Ukraine is an active war zone where the US military has no control, making Monday's visit different from previous presidential trips to Iraq or Afghanistan. White House officials had repeatedly ruled out a visit earlier in the year. Biden is traveling with a relatively small entourage, including national security adviser Jake Sullivan, deputy chief of staff Jen O'Malley Dillon and personal aide Annie Tomasini. President Zelensky first invited Biden to visit Kyiv a year ago, as Russian forces were massing on the border. As recently as last week, Zelensky said his invitation for Biden to visit Ukraine remained open, even as he acknowledged there were other means for them to speak.  Biden visited Ukraine six times as vice president. His last visit to Kyiv was in January 2017, days before leaving office. Before Monday, that visit remained the last highest-ranking visit to Ukraine, since neither Vice President Pence nor President Trump ever visited. ##Biden## CNN’s Chief International Correspondent Clarissa Ward described what she saw as US President Joe Biden met with Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv earlier on Monday.  The pair arrived outside the city’s St. Michael’s Church, Ward told CNN's Max Foster and Bianca Nobilo, entering the building from behind before leaving about five minutes later just before air sirens began to wail. The two leaders then walked out of the church together, following two soldiers who were carrying wreaths to a wall of the fallen, commemorating those who have lost their lives in combat.  Ward went on to say the two leaders stayed there for a moment to pay their respects before embracing each other, showing the “rapport” the leaders have, she said.  Watch: ##Biden## Sitting for talks with President Volodomyr Zelensky in Kyiv on Monday, Joe Biden laid out his rationale for visiting the Ukrainian capital as the war enters a second year. “I thought it was critical that there not be any doubt, none whatsoever, about US support for Ukraine in the war,” the US President said. “The Ukrainian people have stepped up in a way that few people ever have in the past."" Biden emphasized there was broad, bipartisan support in Washington for the Ukrainian cause, even as some Republicans balk at providing further assistance. “For all the disagreement we have in our Congress on some issues, there is significant agreement on support for Ukraine,” he said. “It’s not just about freedom in Ukraine … It’s about freedom of democracy at large,"" he said. Biden arrived in Kyiv at 8 a.m. local time (1:00 a.m. ET), according to reporters traveling with him inside Ukraine. “It’s good to be back in Kyiv,” Biden said when he arrived. He was greeted by the US Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink. Biden's motorcade arrived to the Mariinsky Palace just after 8:30 a.m. local time (1:30 a.m.ET). He was greeted at the entrance by Zelensky and his wife, Olena Zelenska.  “Thank you for coming,” Zelensky said shaking Biden’s hand. “More importantly, how are the children?” Biden asked, while adding: “It’s amazing to see you.” Asked about the significance of being in Kyiv, Biden noted it was his eighth visit to the city. “Each time more significant,” Biden said.  He added that the purpose of his visit was to convey to Zelensky that the US is “here to stay.” “We’re not leaving,” Biden said. ##Biden## US President Joe Biden has been itching to visit Ukraine for months, particularly after several of his counterparts in Europe all made lengthy train journeys to meet with Zelensky in Kyiv.  French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, as well as former British leader Boris Johnson, have all made visits to the country to demonstrate their support. Several of Biden’s top lieutenants, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, have also visited the Ukrainian capital to pledge new assistance. Senior administration officials, including CIA Director Bill Burns and top White House officials, visited Kyiv last month. Biden’s wife, Dr. Jill Biden, paid her own surprise visit on Mother’s Day last year to a small city in the far southwestern corner of Ukraine. She met with Ukrainian first lady Olena Zelenska at a former school that was converted into temporary housing for displaced Ukrainians, including 48 children. Yet security precautions had prevented Biden from making a similar trip. When he visited Poland in April last year, the White House did not even explore the potential for a trip across the border, even though Biden said he had voiced interest. “They will not let me — understandably, I guess — cross the border and take a look at what’s going on in Ukraine,” he said at the time. ##Biden## US President Joe Biden has said he visited Kyiv to reaffirm the United States' ""unwavering"" support for Ukraine, announcing new military aid and a fresh swath of sanctions on the historic trip. ""As the world prepares to mark the one-year anniversary of Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine, I am in Kyiv today to meet with President Zelenskyy and reaffirm our unwavering and unflagging commitment to Ukraine’s democracy, sovereignty, and territorial integrity,"" Biden said in a statement released by the White House. ""When Putin launched his invasion nearly one year ago, he thought Ukraine was weak and the West was divided. He thought he could outlast us. But he was dead wrong,"" Biden said. The President confirmed another donation of US military equipment, and said that later this week his government ""would announce additional sanctions against elites and companies that are trying to evade or backfill Russia’s war machine."" Biden is set to visit Poland later this week as he marks the anniversary of Russia's invasion. ##Biden## President Joe Biden announced a half-billion dollars of additional assistance to Ukraine during a surprise visit to Ukraine on Monday. Biden, in joint remarks alongside Ukrainian President Zelensky, said the package would include more military equipment, including artillery ammunition, more javelins and Howitzers. Zelensky said he and Biden spoke about “long range weapons and the weapons that may still be supplied to Ukraine even though it wasn’t supplied before.”  In remarks, Biden spoke about the resilience of the Ukrainian resistance as the war enters its second year. One year later, Kyiv stands. And Ukraine stands. Democracy stands,” Biden said.  Biden met with Zelensky, as well as first lady Olena Zelenska, at Kyiv's presidential palace on Monday. The historic visit comes just days before the one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion of the country. ##Biden## Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky invited US President Joe Biden to visit Kyiv months ago, saying he believed it was important for the US leader to see the situation up close.  As recently as last week, Zelensky said his invitation for Biden to visit Ukraine remained open. ""President Biden and I meet occasionally. You know that we have invited the President. I think he will be happy to visit Ukraine if he has the opportunity. That would be an important signal to support our nation,” Zelensky said on February 15. Zelensky traveled to Washington in December to meet Biden in the Oval Office and speak to a joint session of Congress — his first trip outside Ukraine since the war began. ##Biden## US President Joe Biden has made a surprise visit to Ukraine early Monday — his first trip to the country since Russia’s invasion began nearly one year ago.  Biden's trip is a show of support for Kyiv that comes at a critical moment in the conflict, as Russia prepares for an expected spring offensive.  ##Biden## Air raid sirens were activated across Ukraine on Monday morning, including in the capital Kyiv, the country’s authorities and CNN teams on the ground reported.  “Please proceed to the shelters!” authorities in Kyiv said in their official Telegram channel. China's Foreign Ministry on Monday said the United States ""is not qualified to lecture"" on the supplying of arms amid concerns from US officials that Beijing is considering providing  ""lethal support"" to Russia's military. Speaking to reporters, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said: ""It is the US side, not the Chinese side, that supplies a steady stream of weapons to the battlefield."" ""The US side is not qualified to lecture China, and we would never accept the US dictating or even coercing pressure on Sino-Russian relations,"" he said.  ""Who is calling for dialogue and peace and who is handing out knives and encouraging confrontation?""  Wang added that China continues to ""urge peace and promote talks"" to resolve the conflict in Ukraine and that it stands firmly on ""playing a constructive role in promoting the de-escalation and cooling down the situation."" Some context: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday he has concerns that Beijing is considering stepping up its partnership with Moscow by supplying Russia's military with “lethal support.” Blinken raised the issue when he met with China's top diplomat Wang Yi on Saturday, officials said. CNN previously reported that the US has begun seeing “disturbing” trendlines of late in China’s support for Russia’s military, and there are signs that Beijing wants to “creep up to the line” of providing lethal military aid to Russia without getting caught, according to US officials familiar with the intelligence. The officials would not describe in detail what intelligence the US has seen suggesting a recent shift in China’s posture but said US officials have been concerned enough that they shared the intelligence with allies and partners. “When you attack us, you will see our faces. Not our backs, but our faces.” The words of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky hours after Vladimir Putin launched his invasion on February 24, 2022. They were prophetic. Many analysts expected Ukrainian resistance to crumble in days. But for a year, the Ukrainian military has faced down a much larger force, rolling back the Russians’ initial gains in Kharkiv and Kherson, holding the line in the hotly contested Donbas region. In the process the Ukrainians have inflicted stunning losses on the Russian army, and laid bare the outmoded tactics, stale leadership and brittle morale of a force more impressive on parade than on the battlefield. By contrast, Ukrainian units have proved nimble and adaptive, harnessing drone technology, decentralized command and smart operational planning to exploit their enemy’s systemic weaknesses. And few would have bet that one year into this war, the vintage Ukrainian air force would still be flying. Read the full analysis here. US President Joe Biden is heading to Poland for a two-day visit to mark the one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, returning to the region as the war enters a volatile new phase without a clear path to peace. Biden will arrive in Warsaw on Tuesday where he will meet with Polish President Andrzej Duda, the White House said in a statement Sunday. ""The President will deliver remarks ahead of the one year anniversary of Russia’s brutal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, addressing how the United States has rallied the world to support the people of Ukraine as they defend their freedom and democracy, and how we will continue to stand with the people of Ukraine for as long as it takes,"" the statement said. One year ago, Biden was urgently warning a sometimes-skeptical world that a massive buildup of Russian troops along Ukraine's borders was the precursor to war. At the time, even some inside his own government questioned the ability of the Ukrainians to withstand an invasion, predicting the imminent fall of the capital Kyiv. Instead, Ukrainian fighters have held the capital and continue to resist Russian attempts to control territory, helped by a massive influx of Western weapons, ammunition and equipment. The war has become a grinding conflict that US officials say could last for months or even years. It has come to shape Biden's foreign policy, the fallout reverberating in the global economy and leading to newfound unity between the United States and its European allies. Biden's aides have been planning for several weeks how they will mark the anniversary of the invasion, including potentially a major address. They hope to emphasize the resilience of the Ukrainian people while stressing the importance of unity in the uncertain months ahead. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is currently preparing for an expected Russian offensive in the spring, appealing to Western governments for additional assistance and weaponry to help sustain the fight. ##Biden## A year into Russia’s brutal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, the US has seen enough. “In the case of Russia’s actions in Ukraine, we have examined the evidence, we know the legal standards, and there is no doubt: These are crimes against humanity,” Vice President Kamala Harris said at the Munich Security Conference this weekend.
“To all those who have perpetrated these crimes, and to their superiors who are complicit in those crimes, you will be held to account.” The declaration marks the strongest accusation yet from the US as it seeks to punish Moscow for its war of aggression. The US government declared last March that members of the Russian armed forces had committed war crimes in Ukraine. President Joe Biden has gone as far as saying that atrocities at the hands of Moscow’s troops qualify as “genocide.” While the “crimes against humanity” determination is significant, it remains largely symbolic for now. It does not immediately trigger any specific consequences, nor does it give the US the ability to prosecute Russians involved with perpetrating crimes. However, it could provide international bodies, such as the International Criminal Court, with evidence to effectively try to prosecute those crimes. Read the full analysis here. Two people were injured following Russian shelling of civilian infrastructure in numerous areas of the Dnipropetrovsk region on Sunday, Mykola Lukashuk, head of the Dnipropetrovsk region council said on Telegram.  “Two districts of Dnipropetrovsk region — Nikopol and Synelnykove — came under enemy fire today. Four attacks on civilian communities were registered during the day,” Lukashuk wrote. “We have two injured.”  The regional head reported Russians also shelled Nikopol, Marhanets, Myrove and Velykomykhailivka communities with ""heavy"" artillery.  Several residential buildings, gas pipelines and power grids were damaged in Myrove, he said. Ukraine is ""inflicting extremely tangible losses"" on Russian troops in the strategic eastern town of Vuhledar, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his nightly address on Sunday.  The situation in the area is “very difficult,” he added.  “The more Russia loses there, in Donbas — Bakhmut, Vuhledar, Maryinka, Kreminna, the sooner we can end this war with Ukraine's victory,” Zelensky said.  Zelensky also noted that the situation around the southern region of Odesa is unchanged and ""we are controlling all potential prospects.""  The situation in Ukraine’s capital Kyiv meanwhile is “completely under control, as well as along the entire northern border,” he said.  New sanctions: Zelensky said he had made “a new sanctions step against all those who fuel Russian aggression.”  “I have signed a decree enacting the National Security and Defense Council [NSDC] decision on sanctions against Russian financial entities,” he said. “These are Ukraine's sanctions. But each of our sanctions packages becomes the basis for working on sanctions with our partners.”  Zelensky implemented a NSDC decision to impose sanctions on an additional 333 Russian citizens and the Moscow Stock Exchange, a public joint-stock company.  ""The next EU sanctions package — the tenth one already — is now being prepared,”  he said. “We are working with our partners to strengthen it."" The US ambassador to the United Nations said Sunday that China would cross a “red line” if the country decided to provide lethal military aid to Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. “We welcome the Chinese announcement that they want peace because that’s what we always want to pursue in situations like this. But we also have to be clear that if there are any thoughts and efforts by the Chinese and others to provide lethal support to the Russians in their brutal attack against Ukraine, that that is unacceptable,” Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield told CNN’s Pamela Brown on “State of the Union.” “That would be a red line,” she said. As CNN previously reported, the US has begun seeing “disturbing” trendlines in China’s support for Russia’s military, and there are signs that Beijing wants to “creep up to the line” of providing lethal military aid to Russia without getting caught, US officials familiar with the intelligence told CNN. The officials would not describe in detail what intelligence the US has seen suggesting a recent shift in China’s posture but said US officials have been concerned enough that they have shared the intelligence with allies and partners at the Munich Security Conference over the past several days. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken raised the issue when he met with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, on Saturday on the sidelines of the conference, officials said. “The secretary was quite blunt in warning about the implications and consequences of China providing material support to Russia or assisting Russia with systematic sanctions evasion,” a senior State Department official told reporters.

The shelling hit the village of Burhunka in the Kherson region, the region's military administration said in a Telegram post. The three people killed were a mother, father and uncle from a family whose house was struck by the shelling, it said. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday he has concerns over China’s support of Russia’s military, specifically that Beijing is considering supplying Moscow with “lethal support.” “We’ve been watching this very closely,” Blinken told “Face the Nation” on CBS while in Munich. “The concern that we have now is based on information we have that they’re considering providing lethal support, and we’ve made very clear to them that that would cause a serious problem for us and in our relationship,” Blinken said. CNN previously reported that the US has begun seeing “disturbing” trendlines of late in China’s support for Russia’s military, and there are signs that Beijing wants to “creep up to the line” of providing lethal military aid to Russia without getting caught, according to US officials familiar with the intelligence. The officials would not describe in detail what intelligence the US has seen suggesting a recent shift in China’s posture but said US officials have been concerned enough that they shared the intelligence with allies and partners at the Munich Security Conference in Germany over the past several days.

Two leading House Republicans have called on President Joe Biden to increase military support to Ukraine in its defense against Russia’s invasion and reiterated support on both sides of the aisle for continuing to fund the Ukrainian war effort. Texas Rep. Mike McCaul, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told CNN’s Pamela Brown on “State of the Union” in a joint interview with House Intelligence Chairman Mike Turner that aired Sunday that bipartisan support for Ukraine is “still very strong.” But as the one-year anniversary of the war approaches, McCaul warned that hedging support for Ukraine could prolong the conflict, which could play into Russia’s advantages and allow anti-Ukraine dissent to build. “The longer (Biden administration officials) drag this out, they play into (Russian leader Vladimir) Putin’s hands. He wants this to be a long, protracted war because he knows that potentially, he will lose — we could lose the will of the American people and therefore the Congress,” the Texas Republican told CNN, speaking from the Munich Security Conference in Germany. The US and its allies have already sent nearly $50 billion in aid and equipment to Ukraine’s military over the past year. To keep that up, and to rebuild its own stockpiles, the Pentagon is racing to re-arm, embarking on the biggest increase in ammunition production in decades and putting portions of the US defense industry on a war-footing despite America technically not being at war. Read more here. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said Sunday that he is “seriously” planning to create his own private military company (PMC), inspired by the Russian mercenary Wagner Group. “Already now we can confidently say that the Wagner has proved its effectiveness in military terms and has drawn a line under the talk about the need for PMCs,” the Chechen leader said in a Telegram post.  Kadyrov already has a private army often referred to as Kadyrovtsy, who are fighting for Russia in Ukraine.  Kadyrov and Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin have been publicly critical of Russian commanders for military failures in Ukraine. Some background: While the Wagner Group has played a key role in Putin's invasion of Ukraine, it has come at a steep cost to human life. The US government estimates Wagner has suffered more than 30,000 casualties, including roughly 9,000 fighters killed, during the conflict. The group has relied heavily on convicts to fill out its ranks. ""That doesn't show any signs of abating,"" a US National Security Council spokesperson said Friday, though Prigozhin claimed last week that he will no longer recruit from prisons. ""They're treating their recruits, largely convicts, as basically cannon fodder, throwing them into a literal meat grinder here, inhuman ways without a second thought,"" said John Kirby, the NSC official. CNN's Sam Fossum contributed to this report. Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny is fond of a phrase, “the wonderful Russia of the future,” his shorthand for a country without President Vladimir Putin. But in the year that has passed since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia has gone back to a dark, repressive past. Over the last 12 months, Putin’s government has crushed the remnants of Russia’s civil society and presided over his country’s first military mobilization since World War II. Political opponents such as Navalny are in prison or out of the country. And Putin has made it clear that he seeks to reassert Russia as an empire in which Ukraine has no place as an independent state. The war in Ukraine drew a bright line under the period of High Putinism, a decade that began with Putin’s controversial return to the presidency in 2012. That era, in hindsight, was a prelude to the current war: Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and backed armed separatists in Ukraine’s Donbas region, while Putin’s technocrats worked on sanction-proofing the Russian economy. Since last February’s invasion, Putin has shrugged off protests and international sanctions. Independent media and human rights groups have been branded as foreign agents or shut down entirely. Russia is now in an uncertain new phase, and it’s clear there will be no rewind, no return to the status quo ante, for ordinary citizens. So is Putin’s grip on power unchallenged? Rumors are now flying inside the country about another wave of mobilization. And in Moscow, signs of elite competition are beginning to emerge, even as some Russians are seeing through the cracks in the wall of state propaganda.

How an old debate previews Biden's new strategy for winning senior voters,2023-02-21,"In pressing Republicans on Social Security and Medicare, President Joe Biden is reprising one of the most dramatic moments of his long career.  During the 2012 vice-presidential debate, Biden engaged in a nearly 11-minute exchange with GOP nominee Paul Ryan over Republican plans to reconfigure the two massive programs for the elderly, several of which Ryan had authored himself.  Biden and many Democrats felt he had won the argument on stage. Yet on Election Day, Ryan and GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney routed Biden and President Barack Obama among White seniors, and beat them soundly among seniors overall, exit polls found.  That outcome underscores the obstacles facing Biden now as he tries to recapture older voters by portraying Republicans as threats to the two towers of America's safety net for the elderly. While polls consistently show that voters trust Democrats more than Republicans to safeguard the programs, GOP presidential nominees have carried all seniors in every presidential election back to 2004 and have reached at least 58% support among White seniors in each of the past four contests, exit polls have found. Democrats have likewise consistently struggled among those nearing retirement, older working adults aged 45-64.  Those results suggest that for most older voters, affinity for the GOP messages on other issues -- particularly its resistance, in the Donald Trump era, to cultural and racial change -- has outweighed their views about Social Security and Medicare. Those grooves are now cut so deeply, over so many elections, that Biden may struggle to change them much no matter how hard he rails against a range of GOP proposals that could retrench or restructure the programs. Biden's charge that Republicans are threatening the two giant entitlement programs for the elderly -- which triggered his striking back and forth exchanges with GOP legislators during the State of the Union -- fits squarely in his broader political positioning as he turns toward his expected reelection campaign. As I've written, the 80-year-old Biden, at his core, ""remains something like a pre-1970s Democrat, who is most comfortable with a party focused less on cultural crusades than on delivering kitchen-table benefits to people who work with their hands."" As president he's expressed that inclination primarily through what he calls his ""blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America"" -- the planks in his economic plans, such as generous incentives to revive domestic manufacturing, aimed at creating more opportunity for workers without a college degree. Politically, Biden's staunch defense of Social Security and Medicare, programs critical to the economic security of financially vulnerable retirees, represents a logical bookend to that emphasis. ""We all know that whose side you are on is a critical debate point for every election and this debate over Social Security and Medicare really helps crystallize whose side Biden is on versus whose side Republicans are on in a very effective way for him,"" said Democratic pollster Matt Hogan, who helped conduct an extensive series of bipartisan polls during the 2022 campaign measuring attitudes among seniors for the AARP, the giant lobby for the elderly. From Franklin Roosevelt through Hubert Humphrey and Tip O'Neill, generations of Democrats have framed themselves as the defenders of the social safety net for seniors against Republicans who they say would unravel it. Biden showed how comfortable he was stepping into those shoes during his 2012 vice-presidential debate with Ryan, then a young representative from Wisconsin who Romney had selected as his running mate. Nearly 30 years Biden's junior, Ryan was an unflinching advocate of restructuring Social Security and Medicare to reduce costs over time. In particular, Ryan was the principal supporter of a conservative plan to convert Medicare, the giant federal health insurance program for the elderly, into a system called ""premium support."" Under that proposal, Medicare would be transformed from its current structure, in which the government directly pays doctors and hospitals who provide care for beneficiaries, into a voucher (or ""premium support"") system, in which the government would provide recipients a fixed sum to purchase private insurance. Ryan had also drafted proposals to partially privatize Social Security by allowing workers to divert part of their payroll taxes into private investment accounts, a change that would have reduced the tax dollars flowing into the system and eventually required substantial cuts in guaranteed benefits. For nearly 11 minutes during the debate in October 2012, moderator Martha Raddatz of ABC skillfully guided Biden and Ryan through a heated, but civil and substantive, discussion of Social Security and Medicare's future. Ryan insisted that changes were needed to preserve the programs' long-term viability and that current seniors and those near retirement would not see their benefits reduced. Biden appealed openly to the Democrats' historic image as the programs' protectors and condemned Ryan and the GOP for wanting to partially privatize them. At one point in the debate, Biden declared: ""we will be no part of a [Medicare] voucher program or the privatization of Social Security."" A few moments later, he insisted: ""These guys haven't been big on Medicare from the beginning. And they've always been about Social Security as little as you can do. Look, folks, use your common sense. Who do you trust on this?"" At the time, Democrats felt Biden had at least held his own, restoring the party's momentum after Obama's surprisingly listless performance eight days earlier in his first debate against Romney. And Democrats through the rest of the campaign railed against the Republican ticket as a threat to Social Security and Medicare. But on election day, those arguments did not translate into gains for Obama and Biden among seniors or the older working adults (aged 45-64) nearing retirement. As Hogan noted, the newly passed Affordable Care Act, which generated some of its funding through savings in Medicare, was extremely unpopular at the time among older voters. Obama and Biden not only lost seniors and the older working age adults, but actually ran slightly more poorly among both groups in 2012 than they did in 2008. In fact, no Democratic presidential nominee since Al Gore in 2000 has carried most seniors in a presidential campaign; Obama in 2008 was the only one since Gore to carry most of the older working age adults. Among older Whites, the Democratic deficit is even more pronounced: the Republican presidential nominee has carried around three-fifths of both White seniors and those nearing retirement in each of the past four elections. Biden in 2020 slightly improved on Hillary Clinton's anemic 2016 performance with both groups, but still lost to Trump by 15 percentage points among White seniors and by 23 points among the Whites nearing retirement, according to the exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN. Biden performed especially poorly among older Whites without a college degree -- an economically stressed group heavily reliant on the federal retirement programs. Estimates by Catalist, a Democratic targeting firm, and the Pew Research Center likewise found that Trump in both 2016 and 2020 beat his Democratic opponents among both seniors and the older working adults. Like the exit polls, the Catalist data show the Republican nominees carrying about three-fifths of White seniors and older working adults in each of the past three presidential elections. The story is similar in congressional contests. In House elections, the exit polls found Republicans winning all seniors and older working adults comfortably in the 2014 and 2022 midterm campaigns and narrowly carrying them even in 2018 when Democrats romped overall. In all three of those midterm congressional elections, Republicans carried about three-fifths of the near retirement White adults, while they also reached that elevated threshold among White seniors in both the 2014 and 2022 campaigns. Republicans have maintained these advantages with older voters despite polls showing that most Americans trust Democrats more than the GOP to protect Social Security and Medicare, and that most Americans, especially seniors, oppose the intermittently surfacing GOP proposals to partially privatize both programs. Politically, ""Democrats have used Social Security and Medicare really a lot over the past two or three decades, maybe four decades,"" said Jim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at Third Way, a centrist Democratic group. ""The payoff has been a lot less than Democrats have generally thought it would be."" Could this time be different for Biden and the Democrats? Congressional Republicans have certainly provided plenty of evidence for his claim that they still hope to restructure the programs. The proposed 2023 budget by the Republican Study Committee, the members of which include about three-fourths of House Republicans, reprises the ideas of converting Medicare into a premium support system and establishing private investment accounts under Social Security, while also raising the retirement age for both programs and reducing Social Security benefits over time. And although Florida Sen. Rick Scott renounced the idea late last week, his ""Rescue America"" agenda did include a proposal to require Congress to reauthorize all federal programs, including Social Security and Medicare, every five years. These ideas have precipitated an unusual degree of open Republican dissension. Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell repeatedly, and unreservedly, denounced the Scott plan until the Florida senator backed off. Trump recently released a video in which he declared the GOP should not cut ""a single penny"" of Social Security or Medicare benefits -- which put him directly at odds with the three-fourths of House Republicans in the Republican Study Committee. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, bending more toward Trump's position, seems unlikely to incorporate into the GOP budget plans the RSC's most sweeping changes in Social Security and Medicare. Kessler believes Biden may succeed where other Democrats have failed at hurting the GOP with the issue, and he argued that the conspicuous Republican infighting demonstrates they share that concern. ""We are watching a high-profile battle that I've never really seen before on these issues in the Republican Party,"" Kessler said. ""And part of it is clearly they think it's a problem when they didn't years ago. If they think it's a problem, maybe it's a problem."" Stuart Stevens, who served as Romney's chief strategist in the 2012 campaign but has since become a fierce critic of the Trump-era GOP, also believes the party could face more risk over its entitlement agenda than it did back th","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.764, 'pos': 0.236, 'compound': 0.5267}",56,108.0,0.037333333333333336,0.8969999999999999,0.0655,0.12179999999999998,0.043,0.855,0.102,0.9982,6.820799999999998,48.495800000000024,764.0,0.06347617801047123
Meet the new face of gun owners in the US: Asian Americans,2023-02-21,"Kris He walked into Arcadia Firearm & Safety in Arcadia, California, three days after his gun license became official. The 22-year-old immigrant from mainland China walked past a Trump flag, past the rifles, and headed to the glass case displaying handguns. He didn't grow up around guns, but after seeing the gun store's website in Chinese, he hoped owner David Liu would answer some of his questions. ""I speak Mandarin and Cantonese. They can use their mother tongue and talk to me. I will try to explain to them about the law and about the safety of firearms,"" said Liu.  Liu opened Arcadia Firearm & Safety in 2016, hoping to reach the growing Asian American population in the suburban sprawl east of Los Angeles. The store sits above a Chinese restaurant, just a few minutes' drive from Monterey Park. The mass shooting in that majority-Asian community last month is the reason why He sought to get a gun license. In the wake of the mass shootings in Monterey Park and Half Moon Bay, a growing number of Asian Americans are buying, or considering buying, guns for protection. Gun safety activists say this trend is in response to increased racial tensions across the country exacerbated by the pandemic and a nationwide gun violence epidemic. ""I'm afraid in my house,"" said He. One of He's friends lost his aunt in the Monterey Park shooting that killed 11 people, mostly Asian. He, who is not a native English speaker, said, ""I think if you have gun, I have gun. I afraid you, you afraid me. So, it's safe."" Liu unlocked his glass case and gave He a handgun to hold, bluntly explaining, in Mandarin, how a new gun owner should train and safely live with a deadly weapon. He said he would think about it and promised to come back.  Attacks against Asian Americans on the rise Asian American buyers make up a small percentage of overall gun sales in the US. In 2021, a Pew Research Center survey found 10% of Asian adults reported they personally owned a gun and another 10% said they live in a household with a gun owner. Thirty-six percent of White adults said they own a gun with another 11% saying they live with a gun owner.  But during the pandemic, the 2021 National Firearms Survey found that many new gun owners were people of color, including Asian Americans. Trish Sargentini, 34, was one of those new Asian American gun buyers. A biotech worker, Sargentini bought a gun for self-defense during the pandemic, driven by fear, a feeling that was entirely new to her living in the Bay Area. ""I definitely felt very worried for myself and others in the Asian American community,"" said Sargentini, reflecting on the dozens of viral videos of Asian Americans being spat on, beaten, tripped and in some cases, murdered. ""That was the first time that it was very clear that I wasn't just American. Suddenly, I'm Asian American."" Charlie Ha, a civil engineer in South San Jose and Vietnamese American, bought his first gun during the pandemic. ""People were being xenophobic, blaming China and other minorities who look like they're Chinese. Being marginalized all your life, it wears on you. When things hit the fan like in this case, it definitely encouraged people to get firearms to protect themselves,"" said Ha. Ha turned to his childhood friend Conrad Bui, a San Francisco chiropractor, for help finding a gun and proper training. Bui says his own wife's attitude about guns has fundamentally changed after watching videos on social media of Asian Americans being harassed. ""My wife feels it's dangerous going out there and that she doesn't feel safe anymore,"" said Bui. For Ha, buying a gun made him realize that ""it's not something that just conservative Americans can do. Everyone has a right to do these things."" Ha, Bui and Sargentini gathered at Chris Cheng's private gun range near Santa Cruz for target practice, what they call their Asian American gun community. ""This is what my gun experience has been like,"" said Cheng, waving at the three Asian friends. ""The face of the typical gun owner being White, that can send a message to say, 'oh, gun ownership is a civil right is only for White people,' which is just factually incorrect,"" said Cheng.  A gay man, Cheng said, ""I'm a diversity and inclusion advocate, no matter where I am, whether it's in the gun community, whether it's in my day job in Silicon Valley."" The gun industry benefits, too  Cheng found fame on History Channel's reality TV show, ""Top Shot."" At the start of the series, he was an amateur gun owner with no formal training. He ended up beating 17 professional marksmen on the show to win a $100,000 cash prize and a contract with a gun seller. That moved him from a life in tech to what he now calls civil rights advocacy in the firearms community. Cheng doesn't shy away from what he believes is a fundamental right that Asian Americans culturally have avoided. ""Responsible gun ownership is for every American in this country, regardless of the color of your skin,"" said Cheng. He took that message to the 2015 meeting of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a firearm industry trade association, delivering a speech titled, ""Diversity: The Next Big Opportunity."" Cheng told the participants that there is an ""opportunity for us to promote the Second Amendment, to promote hunting and sports shooting to this new demographic and make them a multigenerational customer and lifelong Second Amendment advocate."" He urged the industry to recognize that ""diversity is the next area of success"" by targeting messages to ethnic groups and highlighting people of color in marketing. Cheng's message caught the attention of the Violence Policy Center, a non-profit educational organization that approaches gun violence from a public health perspective. ""You could call Chris Cheng an ambassador at best and a salesman at worst,"" says Josh Sugarmann, Violence Policy Center executive director. The organization included Cheng in a 2021 analysis titled, ""How the Firearms Industry Markets Guns to Asian Americans."" ""What you're seeing head-on is the marketing efforts by the gun industry to target a new market. The primary base of the gun industry's sales attention has been older White males. And what's happening is they're dying off. To borrow a phrase in the tobacco industry, the industry is not finding replacement shooters to take their place."" During the pandemic, the gun industry promoted on social media that the path to #StopAsianHate was through more weapons. ""They saw an opportunity with the hate crimes committed against Asian Americans during the pandemic and they stepped in and said, 'this is something we can exploit,'"" said Sugarmann. Cheng admits that diversifying the customer base leads to a stronger business. ""If you want to look at the firearms industry from a business perspective. Sure, right? Anytime a business diversifies (its) demographics, of course, that's good for the bottom line. But this accusation that gun companies put profits over people is just not what the industry is about. The industry is about providing people with the firearm to protect themselves if they choose to do so."" Joining the mainstream Gloria Pan, senior vice president at Moms Rising, a gun safety group, says of Asian American fears, ""I understand. I'm Asian, too."" But she disagrees with the idea that more guns in her community make it safer. ""There are very few verified defensive gun use cases, only about a couple of thousand annually. Balance that against the more than 48,000 firearm deaths, tens of thousands of injuries, hundreds of thousands of abusive uses, and the fact that close to half a million guns are stolen each year. Does he really want to carry a gun around and risk accidentally shooting someone when the actual safety benefits are so slim?"" Pan says historically, Asian American communities have experienced the lowest levels of harm from gun violence because simply put, there are fewer guns in the community. ""We have not had guns on the brain, which, when people have problems, makes turning to firearms as a possible solution that much likelier,"" said Pan. ""Bringing guns into the AAPI community will only increase gun violence in our community. That's exactly what happened in Monterey Park. An ostensibly harmless elderly Asian man's mind was captured by the idea of guns. He decided they were a good idea and brought them into the community. Look what happened."" Sargentini, however, bristles at the argument that making guns more palatable to Asians is dangerous. ""Why are you trying to disarm and further repress an entire group of people?"" said Sargentini. ""It's like saying women who can read are threatening, right? Other women, women of color, minorities, the disenfranchised -- this is an opportunity for them to learn protection of self, learn a new skill. We want to be good people and be good citizens."" After the two mass shootings in California, Sargentini and her friends at the gun range discussed the challenges Asian Americans face and barriers to accessing care for mental illness. They also discussed how to safely store weapons, train and report dangerous behavior. As Asian Americans buy more guns, they are now also faced with how to prevent gun deaths in their communities.","{'neg': 0.179, 'neu': 0.821, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.34}",86,109.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.16,0.712,0.128,-0.9971,0.0,9.697800000000026,790.0,0.012275696202531678
Michigan election denier who has yet to concede her 2022 loss will chair state GOP,2023-02-20,"Michigan Republicans have chosen Kristina Karamo, who has yet to concede last year's secretary of state race, as their next chair, putting an election denier at the head of the party in a crucial battleground state.  Karamo tweeted Sunday that she was ""honored to lead the Michigan Republican Party."" On the heels of the GOP's midterm losses in Michigan last year, the state party backed Karamo at its Saturday night convention over Matthew DePerno, who had former President Donald Trump's backing in the race. DePerno ran unsuccessfully for attorney general last year. Trump congratulated Karamo on Truth Social Sunday, calling her a ""a powerful and fearless Election Denier, in winning the Chair of the GOP in Michigan."" ""If Republicans (and others!) would speak the truth about the Rigged Presidential Election of 2020, like FoxNews should, but doesn't, they would be far better off,"" he said. Karamo, a former community college professor, rose to prominence in Michigan after the 2020 election when she alleged to have witnessed fraud as a poll challenger during the state's count of absentee ballots. She has falsely claimed Trump was the true victor in Michigan in 2020 and has spread the conspiracy theory that left-wing anarchists were behind the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.  Trump had backed Karamo in the 2022 secretary of state race, which she lost by 14 points to incumbent Democrat Jocelyn Benson. A CNN review in November 2021 of Karamo's podcast and writings on her now defunct personal website revealed her declaring herself an ""anti-vaxxer"" in 2020 even before the Covid-19 vaccine became a political flashpoint. She opposed teaching evolution and called public schools ""government indoctrination camps.""  CNN's KFile reported last year that Karamo called abortion ""child sacrifice"" and a ""satanic practice.""","{'neg': 0.27, 'neu': 0.73, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.5859}",13,110.0,0.10225000000000001,0.74975,0.148,0.004924999999999999,0.096,0.812,0.093,-0.784,0.06402499999999998,9.761825000000027,792.0,0.01232553661616165
Opinion: Pence's plan for a 'better deal' on Social Security should be a non-starter,2023-02-20,"Former Vice President Mike Pence — possibly in preparation for a 2024 presidential run — is telling America he wants to replace Social Security with a ""better deal.""  Appearing Thursday on Fox News, Pence laid out his vision to end Social Security as it is currently administered in which all the funds are exclusively invested by the federal government. Instead, Pence proposed altering this program created in 1935 for our nation's older adults by giving younger people the option ""to invest a portion of their Social Security in a private savings account."" He said the current system should be kept in place for those retiring in the next 20 years, but he declared with no ambiguity, ""I think we can replace the New Deal programs with a better deal."" (Social Security was part of a series of programs known as the New Deal that Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt pushed through during the Depression.) Pence ran with former President Donald Trump on the mantle of repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act with ""something terrific"" — as Trump put it — and he apparently wants to do the same now with Social Security. (As an aside, we are still waiting for that ""phenomenal"" health care plan Trump promised in 2020 that would be delivered within the next ""two weeks."") Last week's Fox News interview was not a slip of the tongue by Pence. Earlier in February, the former vice president made the same pledge in a closed-door meeting with a corporate trade group, the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, telling attendees that ""we can replace the New Deal with a better deal,"" according to video footage obtained by the Democratic-aligned group American Bridge 21st Century. Pence asserted that doing so somehow ""could save the government money."" (In actuality, some studies of similar proposals in the past show private accounts would cost the government more money.) If Pence gets his way, the GOP-controlled House of Representatives would play a central role in drafting sweeping changes to a program that is a lifeline for nearly 67 million Americans who receive monthly benefits — people like my own mother. GOP Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, George Santos, Lauren Boebert and others would be involved in drafting and voting on such a policy.  Are these the type of people you trust to protect our nation's older citizens?  (Pence insisted on Fox that ""we have to have a conversation about reforming entitlements in the days ahead,"" and Republicans have been playing defense on Social Security and Medicare after Biden called some of them out in his recent State of the Union address.  McCarthy has vowed to take cuts to Social Security and Medicare ""off the table"" in negotiations over the debt ceiling. And Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell criticized GOP Sen. Rick Scott's original plan to sunset all federal programs after five years, including Social Security and Medicare, calling it ""just a bad idea."" Scott recently added an exemption for Social Security and Medicare to his plan after much criticism. Trump has warned Republicans not to make any cuts to Social Security and Medicare.) If Pence's idea of allowing people to invest their Social Security tax dollars in a private account sounds familiar, it should. In 2005, then-President George W. Bush proposed a similar idea, saying in his State of the Union address: ""As we fix Social Security, we also have the responsibility to make the system a better deal for younger workers. And the best way to reach that goal is through voluntary personal retirement accounts."" Bush sought to build support for this idea by traveling the nation. But he was confronted with a strong backlash from groups such as AARP that ran ads featuring a middle-aged couple saying, ""If we feel like gambling, we'll play the slots."" Bush's approval ratings on Social Security soon began to plummet. In January 2005, a Washington Post/ABC poll found that as Bush kicked off his campaign, 55% of respondents disapproved of his handling of Social Security. By that April, that number had jumped to 64%. Bush's plan to overhaul the program ultimately failed to gain traction. In 1934, with an eye toward the Social Security legislation, Roosevelt noted the stark world facing many older Americans then: ""Old age is at once the most certain, and for many people the most tragic of all hazards,"" he said. ""There is no tragedy in growing old, but there is tragedy in growing old without means of support."" We can't go back to that reality. Beginning in 2035, Social Security will only be able to pay 77% of benefits unless there is some congressional action. Having a good faith discussion on robustly funding the program — such as lifting the cap on earnings subject to Social Security tax from the current rate of $160,200 to all income — is needed.  But recycling old, bad ideas such as the one Pence is peddling should be a non-starter — especially given the composition of the House GOP that would be involved in crafting such legislation. All Americans deserve the right to age with dignity and not have political games played with their golden years.

Biden's trip to Kyiv delivers the starkest rebuke possible to Putin,2023-02-20,"There is no more powerful symbol of Vladimir Putin's failure. A year ago, the Russian leader launched a blitzkrieg against Ukraine, mocking its history and sovereignty, sending his tanks churning toward Kyiv to obliterate the democratically elected government led by a former comic actor. His purpose was clear: To crush once and for all Ukraine's dreams of joining the West and to force it to return to the orbit of greater Russia. Back then, anyone predicting how the anniversary of the war would be marked might have mused about a Russian military parade and a visit by Putin himself to a puppet leader he installed in a nation again under Moscow's iron fist. The reality is far different following heroic Ukrainian resistance bolstered by weapons sent by NATO members. The president of the United States, in overcoat and shades, strolled through Kyiv in daylight, visiting a historic church as air raid sirens wailed and standing exposed alongside President Volodymyr Zelensky in the city's vast, open and iconic St. Michael's Square.  His presence sent a message of defiance to Putin most directly and a cherished sign of resolve and empathy for the people of Ukraine. His audience also included European powers in a western alliance that Biden has led and invigorated like no president since the end of the Cold War. And every time a commander-in-chief makes such an audacious splash on the world stage he's also making a point to Americans -- on whose support continuing extraordinary support for Ukraine's war effort depends -- and to his own fervent domestic critics. Remembering a dark night of invasion   Biden deliberately contrasted the sense of then and now that his visit, just before the anniversary of Russia's invasion, conjured. ""That dark night one year ago, the world was literally at the time bracing for the fall of Kyiv,"" Biden told Zelensky at a news conference flanked by the Stars and Stripes and Ukraine's distinctive blue and yellow national flag. The event itself carried its own symbolism -- it did not feature two leaders cowering in a bunker, but went ahead in an ornate room like any other leaders' press conference in any other capital. ""One year later, Kyiv stands. And Ukraine stands. Democracy stands,"" he declared. ""The Americans stand with you and the world stands with you."" Biden's words might have lacked the poetry of ""Ich bin ein Berliner,"" or ""Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall."" But Biden's visit instantly went down in history alongside two defining trips to divided Berlin by Presidents John Kennedy and Ronald Reagan that were flashpoints of the Cold War and each of which sent their own image of US resolve to the Kremlin. Those events made clear that the United States stood with its Western allies for as long as it took to prevail over the Soviet Union. Biden's visit was meant to give similar historic heft to his comment Washington is there for ""as long as it takes"" — though it's unlikely that it will assuage fears in Kyiv and Europe that a change in president might weaken that US vow. Biden's secret visit, which involved the president leaving the US unannounced and heading to an active war zone, matched some of the colorful stagecraft that Zelensky -- a master of public relations -- has used to maintain Western support for his people and the multi-billion-dollar pipeline of weapons and aid. During America's Middle East wars of the last 20 years, Americans became accustomed to Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump leaving Washington in the dead of night and popping up in Baghdad or Kabul to visit US troops and US-backed leaders. And while those trips had their own measure of daring and danger, Biden's visit went a step further -- venturing into a foreign capital that is often under air attack and lacks the security offered by large garrisons of American troops and air assets. The US did inform Russia of the plans to visit for ""deconfliction purposes,"" according to Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan.  Biden had always planned to visit Europe this week to mark the anniversary of the Russian invasion — though his public program mentioned only a trip to neighboring Poland. But a journey across the Atlantic that lacked a Ukrainian component would have been unsatisfactory given that fact that many European leaders have already visited Kyiv. Still, the security footprint of the US president is far greater than the one accompanying those leaders, and his position as the leader of the West leaves him far more exposed.  But by not visiting Ukraine, Biden would have been implicitly admitting that there were some things that Putin could prevent him from doing -- in effect showing US weakness. Ukrainians understood the intent better than anyone. ""The tipping point in this war will not be when we receive another set of weapons but when our alliance will stop playing reactive roles to what Putin will do,"" Kira Rudik, a member of the Ukrainian parliament, told ""CNN This Morning."" ""President Biden has claimed the upper hand ... and tomorrow Putin will have to reply to what happened today,"" Rudik said, referring to a speech in which Putin is expected to rally the Russian people on Tuesday. After the symbolism, what comes next?   Political symbolism is only effective if it gets results, drives policy and changes an entrenched situation. So, like the Berlin visits of Kennedy and Reagan, the true historic sweep of Biden's perilous journey to Ukraine can only be judged in the light of subsequent events. In other words, his gesture will be an empty one if Russia -- which appears to be mustering for a spring offensive -- wins the war. And while the pictures of Biden in Kyiv were remarkable, they cannot disguise real questions and uncertainties surrounding the US approach to the war and differences with the Ukrainians. This plays out both in the types of weapons the US is prepared to offer and potentially in divergent scenarios about how the war could end. The phrase ""as long as it takes"" can mean different things to different people and there is every sign that this war, which Putin cannot afford to lose, could grind on for many bloody more years, testing Western resolve. The personal nature of the president's rebuke to Putin is meanwhile likely to trigger a response from a ruthless leader who has shown no mercy to civilians and a cruel indifference to the value of human life -- Russian as well as Ukrainian. One potential way Biden's visit could backfire is that it could bolster Putin's claim that he is really fighting a war against the West rather than an independent sovereign nation -- a framing that is popular among some Russians and is one Biden has tried to avoid. The president's visit only served to expose growing opposition to the war among conservative Republicans at home -- which, if not yet near the levels that could force him to desert Ukraine, is sufficient to raise concerns about the size of future aid packages and what a new president after 2024 -- Trump or a GOP leader who shares his ""America First"" tendencies -- could mean for Ukraine. Growing campaign for F-16s  The most glaring difference between Biden and Zelensky lies in the kind of weapons the US president is willing to provide. The government in Kyiv is ratcheting up its campaign for the West to send F-16 jets and is now getting increasing buy-in from some influential bipartisan members of Congress.  Biden has so far declined to agree to the request, which gets to the heart of a dilemma that defines his war strategy: How far to go to help Kyiv win while avoiding a direct clash between the West and Russia. Texas Rep. Mike McCaul, the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, complained on CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday that Washington had taken too long to send game-changing weapons to Ukraine in the past and should not make the same mistake with warplanes. Asked if the Biden administration was now considering the dispatch of F-16 fighter planes, the Texas Republican replied: ""I hope so,"" and added, ""I think the momentum is building for this to happen."" Sending US-made jets to Ukraine could be even more sensitive than the dispatch of the tanks to which the president just agreed. This is because they would enhance Ukraine's capacity to potentially strike at Russian jets and air defense systems inside Russia. The use of NATO aircraft in such operations -- even with Ukrainian pilots -- could prompt the Kremlin to conclude the alliance has directly intervened in the war, increasing the risk of a disastrous escalation of the conflict Biden has tried to avoid. But retired US Brig. Gen. Steve Anderson told CNN's Poppy Harlow Monday that Biden's visit came at another turning point in the war. ""This is a great show of leadership by President Biden. Good leaders always go to the sound of the guns."" But, Anderson added: ""The United States needs to make a decision. Are we in it to ensure the Ukrainians simply not lose? Or are we in it so they can actually win?"" Less importantly globally but still significantly, Biden's trip to Ukraine had domestic political implications.  A grueling and dangerous journey that required energy and endurance felt like a jab at critics who question whether Biden should be contemplating a reelection race at the age of 80.  And like Biden's State of the Union address earlier this month, his stagecraft infuriated the most extreme wing of the Republican Party, which Biden has said is a danger to US democracy and values. Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, for instance, quickly slammed Biden for journeying to Ukraine and other GOP figures accused him of caring more for Kyiv's borders than those in the US. ""This is incredibly insulting. Today on our President's Day, Joe Biden, the President of the United States chose Ukraine over America, while forcing the American people to pay for Ukraine's government and war. I can not express how much Americans hate Joe Biden,"" Greene said in a tweet.  There are many Americans on the right who agree that Biden has not done enough to secure the southern border and the issue will be at the center of the 2024 election. But Greene's comment did not just exemplify the deterioration in civility in US politics. It was revealing from a pro-Trump Republican who has been supportive of the insurrectionists who tried to destroy American democracy on January 6, 2021.  There may be nothing more presidential than standing for the foundational US values of freedom and democracy and the right of a people to repel tyranny enforced at the point of the gun from a more powerful foreign oppressor whose fight for independence mirrors America's own.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",65,112.0,0.11333333333333333,0.818,0.06866666666666667,-0.21563333333333334,0.12,0.772,0.108,-0.992,-14.016166666666667,7.93732500000003,255.0,0.03112676470588247
Ron DeSantis' use of government power to implement agenda worries some conservatives,2023-02-19,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has made freedom his calling card, but some conservatives have become skeptical of how liberally the Republican leader is using government power to impose his will. Among GOP donors, leading conservative voices and even some supporters, there is a growing concern that DeSantis has overstepped in his fight against ""wokeness"" as he seeks to shore up conservative support ahead of a highly anticipated 2024 campaign for president. Several potential rivals for the GOP nomination have seized on DeSantis' brash approach and top-heavy governing style to draw sharp contrasts with the popular Republican. As Florida state lawmakers met earlier this month to hand DeSantis new authority over Disney World -- punishment for the company's opposition to a measure restricting certain classroom instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity -- Republican Gov. Chris Sununu of New Hampshire took a shot at the power grab. ""I'm a principled free-market conservative,"" said Sununu, who is also weighing a bid for president. ""For others out there that think that the government should be penalizing your business because they disagree with you politically, that isn't very conservative."" Even among would-be allies, DeSantis has made critics.  The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a right-of-center First Amendment group that argued for White nationalist Richard Spencer's right to speak on a Florida campus, has joined DeSantis in opposing diversity, equity, and inclusion, or DEI, programs. Nevertheless, the group has repeatedly criticized Florida's heavy-handed approach to forcing conservative beliefs on universities and is suing the state over the Stop WOKE Act, a DeSantis-backed measure that legislated how professors teach certain topics.  ""You cannot censor your way to freedom of expression,"" said Will Creeley, FIRE's legal director. ""You cannot trade one orthodoxy for another. What we've seen recently in Florida is a troubling willingness to do just that."" DeSantis, though, has no shown no signs of halting. In a little over a month since he was sworn in for a second term, DeSantis has settled a score with Disney, threatened to end Advanced Placement classes in Florida, took over a small liberal arts college and vowed to put guardrails on how banks lend money. He has punished political enemies, disrupted institutions, consolidated power and imposed his will on businesses -- all in the name of stopping ""wokeness."" His political committee did not respond to a request for comment on Sununu's remarks. But DeSantis has defended his approach in the past. ""Corporatism is not the same as free enterprise, and I think too many Republicans have viewed limited government to basically mean whatever is best for corporate America is how we want to do the economy,"" the Florida governor said at a speech last year at the National Conservatism Conference. ""My view is, you know, obviously free enterprise is the best economic system, but that is a means to an end."" Looking at the long term While the record DeSantis is building is almost sure to play well with many GOP primary voters, a sense of concern is palpable, particularly on matters of race, among some Republicans who are supportive of the governor. ""Being perceived as racially insensitive is not a good place for him to be in the long term,"" a Republican supporter of DeSantis said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to talk frankly about an area of rising worry. The supporter pointed directly to the fight over an Advanced Placement course on African American studies and DeSantis' quarrel with the College Board, saying the governor could alienate some voters who would otherwise be supportive. Another Republican fundraiser close to the governor told CNN that there is concern DeSantis is going overboard with ""anti-woke stuff"" but added: ""You've gotta win the primary first."" DeSantis is so far drawing the most support from Republicans looking to move on from former President Donald Trump, according to recent polls. Some have suggested DeSantis could be Trump without the baggage of his first term, his two campaigns and his post-presidency obsession with the 2020 election. For his part, DeSantis has privately told supporters he believes Trump's divisiveness and addiction to political drama distracted from advancing his agenda. Trump but more effective, is how some around the governor have outlined his path to defeating the former president in a primary. But Republicans voters have yet to be introduced to many potential contenders for the party nomination. Meanwhile, outside groups such as the Club for Growth and Americans for Prosperity have signaled they intend to get involved in the primary.  Frayda Levin, a member of the Club for Growth's board of directors, said there is great interest in DeSantis but she is increasingly concerned that he has become ""too heavy-handed"" in his pursuit of hot-button social issues. DeSantis is one of six Republicans invited to a Club for Growth donor summit in Florida as the conservative organization distances itself further from Trump. Former Vice President Mike Pence, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley are also invited. ""I'm a genuine libertarian; I'm kind of a live-and-let-live kind of girl,"" Levin told CNN. She said she has no problem with candidates espousing strongly held personal beliefs on social issues but said she objects to DeSantis ""putting the power of his state behind his socially conservative views."" A free-market debate DeSantis' pugilistic style has become a frequent topic of debate among free-market conservatives who believe the government shouldn't interfere with businesses. DeSantis has often intervened if he accuses a business of running afoul of his vision of freedom. He instigated a standoff with the cruise line industry during the pandemic over their vaccine policies, banned businesses from requiring masks and vaccines, and championed a bill that restricted how businesses train workers around topics such as race and gender.  ""DeSantis is always talking about he was not demanding that businesses do things, but he was telling the cruise lines what they had to do,"" former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a fellow Republican, said of DeSantis last year. Hogan has remained critical of the Florida governor as he weighs entering the mix for the Republican nomination. Meanwhile, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, another potential GOP contender, has also compared her Covid19 record against DeSantis in ways that suggest Florida was too hands-on -- for ideologically disparate reasons. Noem said Friday it was her state, not Florida, that ""set an example of freedom"" by refusing to shut down at all. Florida, which DeSantis has called a Citadel of Freedom, closed schools, bars and theme parks and restricted other economic activity early in the pandemic.    DeSantis has built his political persona around protecting freedoms. He dubbed his 2022 spending plan the ""Freedom First Budget"" and rebranded this year's financial blueprint as the ""Framework for Freedom."" He pitched the tourism slogan ""Vacation to Freedom"" during the pandemic and ""Freedom over Faucism"" is a frequent applause line in his speeches. On election night last fall, he stood victorious behind a podium adorned with a sign: ""Freedom Lives Here."" But his approach has often included more government programs (creating an office to pursue voter fraud and a new program to conduct missions to surveil, house and transport migrants from border states to Democratic jurisdictions), more regulation (dictating bank lending practices) or flexing government power in unprecedented manners (ousting an elected state prosecutor). ""I'm troubled by this trend, because what I think the interpretation will be is that this is working,"" Katherine Mangu-Ward, the editor-in-chief of the libertarian magazine Reason, said in a recent podcast episode centered around DeSantis' tactics. ""DeSantis is raising his profile every single week. He is putting himself in a better position to potentially win the presidency. And he is doing it through indiscriminate use of state power, not only to achieve kind of broader ends, but also just to score points."" ""That is not a good way to run a state. That is not a good way to run a country,"" she added. Allies push back DeSantis' allies have pushed back against the growing chatter. Christopher Rufo, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, contended on Twitter recently that the governor was using his power as an elected leader -- a job he was reelected to with a historical 19-point victory in November.   DeSantis last month appointed Rufo to the board of New College, a small liberal arts school that the governor has targeted for a drastic overhaul to become a more conservative university. ""The complaint about using 'state power,' meaning constitutionally-mandated democratic governance, to correct the ideological corruption of *public universities,* i.e., state institutions funded by taxpayers, is ridiculous,"" Rufo tweeted. ""Amounts to 'the people can't regulate the state.'"" And even where there is apprehension among allies, DeSantis has not necessarily lost support. Ken Griffin, the billionaire hedge fund owner of Citadel and a major DeSantis donor, said he was ""troubled"" last year by the governor's move against Disney.  ""I don't appreciate Gov. DeSantis going after Disney's tax status,"" Griffin said at the time. ""It can be portrayed or feel or look like retaliation. And I believe that the people who serve our nation need to rise above these moments in time in their conduct and behavior."" But later in 2022, Griffin touted DeSantis' ""tremendous record"" in an interview with Politico and suggested he would back the Florida governor in the GOP primary for president. ""Would I support him? The bigger question is, is he going to run?"" Griffin said. ""That bridge has to be crossed.""

Primary voters aren't excited about Biden or Trump. What does that mean for 2024?,2023-02-19,"The first phase of the 2024 presidential primary season is officially underway, bringing with it a cavalcade of early polling designed to answer a seemingly basic question: whether President Joe Biden and his predecessor, Donald Trump, have the support of their respective parties.  That topic, though, is more complicated than it seems, reflecting voters' complex attitudes toward the two men, which in both cases fall far short of either an enthusiastic endorsement or a definitive rejection. At first glance, Trump, who launched his third bid for the presidency in November, and Biden, who is yet to officially announce his reelection plans, seem to face similar challenges.  Just 44% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents in a recent Washington Post-ABC News poll said they'd prefer to see Trump win the party nomination in 2024, with an even slimmer 31% on the Democratic side saying they'd like to see Biden renominated.  That's in line with other recent polls, including a December CNN survey that found just 38% of Republican-aligned voters and 40% of Democratic aligned-voters thought their parties should renominate Trump and Biden, respectively. But while many Republicans and Democrats would prefer to see someone else nominated, the vague concept of ""someone else"" isn't an eligible challenger for the presidency. And when it comes to specific, viable rivals, Trump and Biden currently face very different situations. So far, one potential primary challenger to Trump has significantly broken through among the GOP faithful, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, although polls have varied on his precise strength against the former president.  When a recent Monmouth University poll asked GOP and GOP-leaning voters an open-ended question about whom they'd like to see as their party's nominee next year, most named either Trump (33%) or DeSantis (33%). Two percent or fewer mentioned anyone else as a possible nominee -- including former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, the latest entrant into the GOP race who'd yet to declare when the survey was taken.  CNN's December polling found that among Republican-aligned voters who favored a nominee besides Trump, 47% had a particular alternate candidate in mind, including 38% who singled out DeSantis. There are no similarly prominent rivals to Biden: 72% of Democratic-aligned voters in CNN's December poll who wanted to see the party nominate someone else said they had nobody specific in mind. Despite the lukewarm partisan reactions to Trump's and Biden's 2024 candidacies, both are well-regarded within their parties, for the most part.  In the Post-ABC poll, 79% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents said they'd feel positively if Trump were elected to the White House in 2024, with 72% of Democrats and Democratic-leaners saying the same about the prospect of Biden being reelected. Just 7% on the Republican side said they'd be angry to see Trump return to office, with only 3% on the Democratic side saying they'd be angry to see Biden serve another term, the Post-ABC survey found. And in a January CNN poll, 29% of Republican adults said they viewed Trump unfavorably, compared with the 14% of Democrats who expressed an unfavorable view of Biden. With nearly a year to go before any votes are cast, the 2024 primary landscape remains liable to change, as new candidates enter the race and voters learn more about them. That's particularly true on the Republican side, where a number of politicians have openly signaled interest in running; Democratic leaders, by contrast, have largely shied away from calls to challenge a Biden reelection campaign. None of the recent survey findings predict how the presidential primary landscape will develop in the months to come, or how public opinion might evolve in response. But taken together, they help to paint a fuller picture of where things stand now. Both Trump and Biden remain generally well-liked by their respective parties, even as Democrats and Republicans also express a shared eagerness to find alternatives. And so far, Trump, unlike Biden, has seen at least one real potential challenger emerge.","{'neg': 0.135, 'neu': 0.865, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.2584}",24,114.0,0.021214285714285717,0.8592142857142857,0.11964285714285716,0.38645833333333335,0.034,0.849,0.116,0.9946,9.275,24.39072500000003,213.0,0.11451044600938982
Opinion: What Putin forgot when he invaded Ukraine,2023-02-19,"When Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941, dictator Joseph Stalin was too shocked to speak in public for nearly two weeks.   On July 3, he finally gave a radio speech, trying to reassure his nation — already suffering serious battlefield losses to the German blitzkrieg — with the words, ""History shows that there are no invincible armies."" Germany's ""Operation Barbarossa"" involved more than 3 million troops, about 3,000 tanks and 2,500 aircraft — one of the largest invasion forces in history. Expecting to conquer Moscow within weeks, Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler thought the Soviet regime would quickly disintegrate. Over the next four years though, Hitler's armies proved to be anything but invincible. One year ago, Stalin's heir in the Kremlin, Russian President Vladimir Putin, launched an army — one that he likely thought was invincible — into Ukraine, aiming to quickly decapitate its leadership and seize Kyiv. His hopes were frustrated by Ukraine's spirited defense under President Volodymyr Zelensky, and the two nations continue to be locked in a savage conflict.  Contrary to what most people expected before the war, it's a stalemate, observed retired US General David Petraeus, in a Q&A with CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen. So how does the Russian leader look a year after his decision?  ""Putin has earned a failing grade to date,"" said Petraeus, who commanded the US wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. ""Let's recall that the first and most important task of a strategic leader is to 'get the big ideas right' — that is, to get the overall strategy and fundamental decisions right. Putin clearly has failed abysmally in that task, resulting in a war that has made him and his country a pariah, set back the Russian economy by a decade or more (losing many of Russia's best and brightest, and prompting over 1,200 western companies to leave Russia or reduce operations there), done catastrophic damage to the Russian military and its reputation and put his legacy in serious jeopardy.""  Still, it would be a mistake to underestimate Russia, Petraeus noted, citing a maxim often attributed, perhaps wrongly, to Stalin: ""Quantity has a quality of its own.""  During World War II, the Soviet Union's ability to call on vast reserves and sustain enormous casualties, despite having inferior tanks and planes, helped it to defeat Germany.  Today, Russia's population is more than three times the size of Ukraine's and it can afford to send more soldiers into the fight. But in Ukraine's case there's an intangible factor. ""Ukrainians know what they are fighting for,"" Petraeus noted, ""while it is not clear that the same is true of many of the Russian soldiers, a disproportionate number of whom are from ethnic and sectarian minorities in the Russian Federation."" Lives disrupted and destroyed On February 23, 2022, Diliara Didenko, went to bed in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, ""thinking that I would celebrate my husband's birthday the next day. Our life was getting better. My husband was running his own business. Our daughter had started school and made friends there. We were lucky to have arranged support services and found a special needs nursery for our son. I finally had time to work. I felt happy."" She had no inkling that the outbreak of war would force her to restart her life in the Czech Republic within 22 days.  ""Completely exhausted, crushed and scared, we had to brace ourselves and come to terms with our forced displacement. I will be forever grateful to all those who helped us come to Prague and adjust to a new life in a foreign land."" Didenko's is one story among the tens of millions of lives displaced, disrupted or cut short by the war.

On quiet summer evenings, she would ""sit outside the MSU Dairy Store licking an ice cream cone ... I was safe in this community where we looked out for one another. I had space to run and play, to grow and imagine and learn."" ""Since moving away from home, those childhood memories have moored me to the place where I grew up, where life felt simple and the world felt kind,"" she observed. ""On Monday night, when news broke that there was an active shooter on Michigan State's campus, I clung to those memories."" Goldynia's mother was among those locked down for hours when a shooter killed three people and injured five more. The news alarmed those on campus and rippled out to the enormous alumni network of MSU, which has about 50,000 current students.  ""I think about the words Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer spoke on Tuesday morning — 'Our Spartan community is reeling today' — and I wonder if the 'reeling' ever ends and, if it does, what comes afterward,"" Goldynia wrote. In the Detroit Free Press, Jemele Hill, who graduated from MSU, wrote, ""What happened ... is a reminder that the regularity of these acts is bringing violence even closer to all of us. Some of the students whom Americans saw struggling to process what happened had already lived through another mass shooting — in Oxford, or Newtown, Conn. Many of the students who fled certain buildings on campus the night of the shooting were just following the protocols they'd been taught prior to coming to Michigan State, because teaching children and young adults how not to be killed in mass shootings is now a staple of America's egregious routine.""

For months, former President Donald Trump was the only candidate for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. This week, Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and US ambassador to the UN, entered the fray, saying, ""We are more than ready for a new generation to lead us into the future."" As SE Cupp noted, Haley called for going beyond the ""faded names of the past"" and argued for term limits for members of Congress and ""mandatory mental competency tests for politicians over 75 years old.""  Trump is 76 and President Joe Biden is 80. But the real question, in Cupp's view, is this: ""Will Haley also bring substantively different views that appeal to younger generations?""  ""Will she break with the election denialism, grievance politics, white nationalism and conspiracy theories that Trumpism allowed?"" And, Cupp added, where will Haley stand on immigration, gun control, climate change, abortion and other issues that particularly resonate with younger voters?

As Jill Filipovic pointed out, the jurors, who likely included some Trump voters, ""were asked to assess whether it's possible that a former president and his allies had leveraged an attack on American democracy, or whether that president was telling the truth when he said the election was stolen."" In a unanimous conclusion, ""they found that, contrary to the former president's claims, there was no evidence of widespread fraud undermining the results of the election, and that at least some criminal charges should be brought."" ""If average people selected for a special grand jury can complete this task with honesty and integrity, surely it's not asking too much for Republican officeholders to approach their roles with similar gravity: To declare that the election was free and fair, and to ask that those who may have broken the law or lied be held accountable,"" wrote Filipovic.  A court filing the same day in the libel lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems against Fox News revealed more damning information. Writing in CNN's Reliable Sources newsletter, Oliver Darcy observed, ""Despite what the right-wing talk channel peddled to its millions of loyal viewers in the immediate aftermath of the 2020 election, behind the scenes its most prominent stars and highest-ranking executives privately trashed claims of election fraud.""  More questions than answers The derailment that left 20 cars of hazardous materials in the village of East Palestine, Ohio, more than two weeks ago is still a huge concern for residents seeking answers.   Judith A. Lennington, a factory worker turned book author and a longtime resident, saw the effects of the disaster from her farm three miles away. ""The cloud that went up in the sky was like nothing I've ever seen in my life,"" she told CNN Opinion's Stephanie Griffith. ""It looked like a huge black cloud with a tornado coming down from it. It was just awful. After the accident, we put quilts over the doors and over the windows, sealed the cracks and just stayed inside.""  ""I can still smell it outside. Luckily the fumes are not strong here — the wind blows in the other direction — but I can, still, if I go from the house to the garage, I can feel my eyes burning. And I lose my voice after a while..."" ""So I don't know what's going to happen. Is it safe to let your children go out and walk in that grass?

Seeking help The newly elected Sen. John Fetterman checked himself into Walter Reed National Military Medical Center Thursday for treatment of ""clinical depression,"" his chief of staff announced. Fetterman, recovering from a stroke during his campaign last year, deserves credit for seeking help and being open about it, wrote psychologist Peggy Drexler.  ""We're right to want to know about the health issues facing our leaders and the steps they're taking to get the help they need, but it's important to remember that millions of Americans battle depression and lead highly productive, successful lives. ... We're living in tough times, and almost everybody hurts; if our leaders are meant to represent us, how can we possibly fault them for being, in fact, just like us?""  Balloon mysteries The episode of the Chinese balloon was followed by an even stranger one: US fighter jets shot down three more objects of so-far unknown origin over the US and Canada. President Biden spoke about the shootdowns for the first time on Thursday, saying that there was no indication the last three were connected to the balloon from China, which US officials said was intended for surveillance.

These 26 words 'created the internet.' Now the Supreme Court may be coming for them,2023-02-18,"Congress, the White House and now the US Supreme Court are all focusing their attention on a federal law that's long served as a legal shield for online platforms.  This week, the Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments on two pivotal cases dealing with online speech and content moderation. Central to the arguments is ""Section 230,"" a federal law that's been roundly criticized by both Republicans and Democrats for different reasons but that tech companies and digital rights groups have defended as vital to a functioning internet.   Tech companies involved in the litigation have cited the 27-year-old statute as part of an argument for why they shouldn't have to face lawsuits alleging they gave knowing, substantial assistance to terrorist acts by hosting or algorithmically recommending terrorist content.  A set of rulings against the tech industry could significantly narrow Section 230 and its legal protections for websites and social media companies. If that happens, the Court's decisions could expose online platforms to an array of new lawsuits over how they present content to users. Such a result would represent the most consequential limitations ever placed on a legal shield that predates today's biggest social media platforms and has allowed them to nip many content-related lawsuits in the bud.   And more could be coming: the Supreme Court is still mulling whether to hear several additional cases with implications for Section 230, while members of Congress have expressed renewed enthusiasm for rolling back the law's protections for websites, and President Joe Biden has called for the same in a recent op-ed.  Here's everything you need to know about Section 230, the law that's been called ""the 26 words that created the internet.""  A law born in the early days of the World Wide Web  Passed in 1996 in the early days of the World Wide Web, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act was meant to nurture startups and entrepreneurs. The legislation's text recognized that the internet was in its infancy and risked being choked out of existence if website owners could be sued for things that other people posted.   One of the law's architects, Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden, has said that without Section 230, ""all online media would face an onslaught of bad-faith lawsuits and pressure campaigns from the powerful"" seeking to silence them. He's also said Section 230 directly empowers websites to remove content they believe is objectionable by creating a ""good Samaritan"" safe harbor: Under Section 230, websites enjoy immunity for moderating content in the ways they see fit — not according to others' preferences — although the federal government can still sue platforms for violating criminal or intellectual property laws.  Contrary to what some politicians have claimed, Section 230's protections do not hinge on a platform being politically or ideologically neutral. The law also does not require that a website be classified as a publisher in order to ""qualify"" for liability protection. Apart from meeting the definition of an ""interactive computer service,"" websites need not do anything to gain Section 230's benefits -- they apply automatically.   The law's central provision holds that websites (and their users) cannot be treated legally as the publishers or speakers of other people's content. In plain English, that means that any legal responsibility attached to publishing a given piece of content ends with the person or entity that created it, not the platforms on which the content is shared or the users who re-share it.  The seemingly simple language of Section 230 belies its sweeping impact. Courts have repeatedly accepted Section 230 as a defense against claims of defamation, negligence and other allegations. In the past, it's protected AOL, Craigslist, Google and Yahoo, building up a body of law so broad and influential as to be considered a pillar of today's internet.  ""The free and open internet as we know it couldn't exist without Section 230,"" the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group, has written. ""Important court rulings on Section 230 have held that users and services cannot be sued for forwarding email, hosting online reviews, or sharing photos or videos that others find objectionable. It also helps to quickly resolve lawsuits cases that have no legal basis.""  In recent years, however, critics of Section 230 have increasingly questioned the law's scope and proposed restrictions on the circumstances in which websites may invoke the legal shield.  Bipartisan criticism, for different reasons  For years, much of the criticism of Section 230 has come from conservatives who say that the law lets social media platforms suppress right-leaning views for political reasons.   By safeguarding platforms' freedom to moderate content as they see fit, Section 230 does shield websites from lawsuits that might arise from that type of viewpoint-based content moderation, though social media companies have said they do not make content decisions based on ideology but rather on violations of their policies.  The Trump administration tried to turn some of those criticisms into concrete policy that would have had significant consequences, if it had succeeded. For example, in 2020, the Justice Department released a legislative proposal for changes to Section 230 that would create an eligibility test for websites seeking the law's protections. That same year, the White House issued an executive order calling on the Federal Communications Commission to interpret Section 230 in a more narrow way.   The executive order faced a number of legal and procedural problems, not least of which was the fact that the FCC is not part of the judicial branch; that it does not regulate social media or content moderation decisions; and that it is an independent agency that, by law, does not take direction from the White House.  Even though the Trump-era efforts to curtail Section 230 never bore fruit, conservatives are still looking for opportunities to do so. And they aren't alone. Since 2016, when social media platforms' role in spreading Russian election disinformation broke open a national dialogue about the companies' handling of toxic content, Democrats have increasingly railed against Section 230.   By safeguarding platforms' freedom to moderate content as they see fit, Democrats have said, Section 230 has allowed websites to escape accountability for hosting hate speech and misinformation that others have recognized as objectionable but that social media companies can't or won't remove themselves.  The result is a bipartisan hatred for Section 230, even if the two parties cannot agree on why Section 230 is flawed or what policies might appropriately take its place.   ""I would be prepared to make a bet that if we took a vote on a plain Section 230 repeal, it would clear this committee with virtually every vote,"" said Rhode Island Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse at a hearing last week of the Senate Judiciary Committee. ""The problem, where we bog down, is that we want 230-plus. We want to repeal 230 and then have 'XYZ.' And we don't agree on what the 'XYZ' are.""  Courts take the lead  The deadlock has thrown much of the momentum for changing Section 230 to the courts — most notably, the US Supreme Court, which now has an opportunity this term to dictate how far the law extends.  Tech critics have called for added legal exposure and accountability. ""The massive social media industry has grown up largely shielded from the courts and the normal development of a body of law. It is highly irregular for a global industry that wields staggering influence to be protected from judicial inquiry,"" wrote the Anti-Defamation League in a Supreme Court brief.  For the tech giants, and even for many of Big Tech's fiercest competitors, it would be a bad thing, because it would undermine what has allowed the internet to flourish. It would potentially put many websites and users into unwitting and abrupt legal jeopardy, they say, and it would dramatically change how some websites operate in order to avoid liability.   The social media platform Reddit has argued in a Supreme Court brief that if Section 230 is narrowed so that its protections do not cover a site's recommendations of content a user might enjoy, that would ""dramatically expand Internet users' potential to be sued for their online interactions.""  ""'Recommendations' are the very thing that make Reddit a vibrant place,"" wrote the company and several volunteer Reddit moderators. ""It is users who upvote and downvote content, and thereby determine which posts gain prominence and which fade into obscurity.""  People would stop using Reddit, and moderators would stop volunteering, the brief argued, under a legal regime that ""carries a serious risk of being sued for 'recommending' a defamatory or otherwise tortious post that was created by someone else.""  While this week's oral arguments won't be the end of the debate over Section 230, the outcome of the cases could lead to hugely significant changes the internet has never before seen — for better or for worse.

Jimmy Carter to begin receiving home hospice care,2023-02-18,"Former US President Jimmy Carter will begin receiving hospice care at his home in Georgia, according to a statement from The Carter Center on Saturday. ""After a series of short hospital stays, former US President Jimmy Carter today decided to spend his remaining time at home with his family and receive hospice care instead of additional medical intervention. He has the full support of his family and his medical team,"" the statement said. Jason Carter, a onetime Democratic state senator in Georgia and the former president's grandson, said he visited Friday with his grandparents and that ""they are at peace and -- as always -- their home is full of love."" Jimmy Carter, who turned 98 last year, became the oldest living US president in history after the passing of George H.W. Bush, who died in late 2018 at 94. The nation's 39th president has kept a low public profile in recent years due to the coronavirus pandemic but has continued to speak out about risks to democracy around the world, a longtime cause of his. Carter beat brain cancer in 2015 but faced a series of health scares in 2019, and consequentially underwent surgery to remove pressure on his brain. His health woes forced him to give up his decadeslong tradition of teaching Sunday school at Maranatha Baptist Church in his hometown of Plains, Georgia.  A peanut farmer and US Navy lieutenant before going into politics, Carter, a Democrat, eventually served one term as governor of Georgia and president of the United States from 1977 to 1981. The former president is widely revered for his championing of human rights. His brokering of the Camp David Accords in 1978 with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin remains central to his legacy. In his post-presidency years, Carter founded The Carter Center along with his wife, Rosalynn, in hopes of advancing world peace and health. The center has worked to advance democracy by monitoring foreign elections and reducing diseases in developing countries over the years.  Carter himself has been a longtime volunteer with Habitat for Humanity. He received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his efforts to push for peace across the globe. President Joe Biden, a fellow Democrat and longtime admirer of Carter, has been advised of the former president's declining health and his decision to seek hospice care, an official told CNN. Biden is staying in close contact with the Carter family and the former president's close circle of advisers. The Bidens traveled to Georgia to visit the Carters in 2021 -- on the 100th day of Biden's presidency.  Biden was one of the first US senators to endorse Carter in his 1976 presidential bid, according to the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library.  Carter was in touch with President Donald Trump and his administration multiple times during the Republican's time in office. In 2018, Carter said he received a briefing on North Korea and said he'd be willing to travel to the country on the Trump administration's behalf. He also wrote Trump a letter on US-China trade relations and spoke with him by phone in April 2019.  While the White House referred to the call as a ""very good telephone conversation"" and said that Trump ""has always liked President Carter,"" the relationship deteriorated later that year when the Georgia Democrat called for a full investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and suggested it ""would show that Trump didn't actually win the election in 2016."" Carter later issued warnings about Trump's decision to halt funding to the World Health Organization amid the Covid-19 pandemic. This story and headline have been updated with additional information.

"Fox News executives refused to let Trump on-air when he called in during January 6 attack, Dominion says",2023-02-17,"Former President Donald Trump tried to call into Fox News after his supporters attacked the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, but the network refused to put him on air, according to court filings from Dominion Voting Systems in its defamation case against the company.   The House select committee that investigated the January 6 attack did not know that Trump had made this call, according to a source familiar with the panel's work. The panel sought to piece together a near minute-by-minute account of Trump's movements, actions and phone calls on that day. His newly revealed call to Fox News shows some of the gaps in the record that still exist, due to roadblocks the committee faced. ""The afternoon of January 6, after the Capitol came under attack, then-President Trump dialed into Lou Dobbs' show attempting to get on air,"" Dominion lawyers wrote in their legal brief. ""But Fox executives vetoed that decision,"" Dominion's filing continued. ""Why? Not because of a lack of newsworthiness. January 6 was an important event by any measure. President Trump not only was the sitting President, he was the key figure that day."" The network rebuffed Trump because ""it would be irresponsible to put him on the air"" and ""could impact a lot of people in a negative way,"" according to Fox Business Network President Lauren Petterson, whose testimony was cited by Dominion in the new filing. Dobbs' show on Fox Business -- in which he routinely promoted baseless conspiracies about the 2020 election -- was canceled a few weeks after the January 6 insurrection. Fox News and its parent company have denied all wrongdoing and are aggressively fighting Dominion's defamation lawsuit. In a previous statement, a Fox spokesperson claimed that Dominion ""mischaracterized the record"" in its court filing and ""cherry-picked quotes"" that were ""stripped of key context."" The most prominent stars and highest-ranking executives at Fox News privately ridiculed claims of election fraud in the 2020 election, despite the right-wing channel allowing lies about the presidential contest to be promoted on its air, damning messages contained in a Thursday court filing revealed. The messages showed that Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham brutally mocked lies being pushed by Trump's camp asserting that the election had been rigged. In one set of messages revealed in the court filing, Carlson texted Ingraham, saying that Sidney Powell, an attorney who was representing the Trump campaign, was ""lying"" and that he had ""caught her"" doing so. Ingraham responded, ""Sidney is a complete nut. No one will work with her. Ditto with Rudy [Giuliani]."" The messages also revealed that Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of Fox Corporation, did not believe Trump's election lies and even floated the idea of having Carlson, Hannity and Ingraham appear together in prime time to declare Joe Biden as the rightful winner of the election. Such an act, Murdoch said, ""Would go a long way to stop the Trump myth that the election stolen."" The court filing offered the most vivid picture to date of the chaos that transpired behind the scenes at Fox News after Trump lost the election and viewers rebelled against the channel for accurately calling the contest in Biden's favor. Dominion filed its mammoth lawsuit against Fox News in March 2021, alleging that during the 2020 presidential election the network ""recklessly disregarded the truth"" and pushed various pro-Trump conspiracy theories about the election technology company because ""the lies were good for Fox's business."" Fox News has not only vigorously denied Dominion's claims, it has insisted it is ""proud"" of its 2020 election coverage.","{'neg': 0.261, 'neu': 0.739, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.6486}",25,118.0,0.11116666666666668,0.8621666666666666,0.02658333333333333,-0.4789555555555556,0.154,0.795,0.051,-0.9971,-11.97388888888889,17.193794444444475,193.0,0.08908701784686256
Why it's better to start a presidential campaign early,2023-02-18,"The nascent 2024 presidential campaign seemed to hit a different gear this week with Nikki Haley entering the Republican primary. The former South Carolina governor and onetime United Nations ambassador joins former President Donald Trump as the only major competitors to declare bids for the presidency.  Haley's announcement, and the lack of one so far from President Joe Biden and a slew of Republicans, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, got me thinking: Do primary winners tend to be early or late entrants to the presidential race?  The answer depends on who else is running. If you're in a primary without an incumbent, then it's better to be early, while it matters far less with an incumbent running.  The right time to run The modern primary era began in 1972 on the Democratic side and in 1976 on the Republican side. Since then, hundreds of major candidates have decided to run for president or at least formed exploratory committees with the Federal Election Commission. For each of them, I jotted down whichever date was first, to see if there was a pattern.  It turns out that the median date for candidates to enter a presidential primary without an incumbent has been March 16 the year before the general election. There has been a wide variation on that from year to year. Some years, the median candidate gets in really early (January 2007 for the 2008 cycle on both the Democratic and Republican side), while other years it's much later (August 1991 for the 1992 cycle on the Democratic side).  There is no real correlation between how late or how early a field forms and the eventual nominee's success in the general election. Democrats, for example, won the presidency in both 1992 and 2008, even with a much later start in 1992.  What does seem to matter for winning a primary is when candidates get into the race compared with their competitors. In the 17 primaries since 1972 that did not feature an incumbent, 10 of the winning candidates entered earlier than that year's median candidate. Two of the winners were the median candidates. Five got into the race later than the median candidate.  There were six who started running about one and a half months or more before that cycle's median candidate. Democrat George McGovern, in the 1972 cycle, started nearly a full year before the median hopeful that cycle. McGovern remains the only major-party nominee who had less than 5% of the vote in early national surveys while the polling leader had more than 20% support. McGovern's success is part of the reason why primary campaigns seem to start so early compared with when the actual voting takes place.  Getting in the public eye early, raising money and building an organization are key to winning a presidential campaign. If you fall too far behind, it can be a disaster.  Even candidates you might ""think"" entered the race late, often got in far earlier. Trump's June 2015 official announcement became well known for his ride down the escalator. Less remembered was the fact that he started an exploratory committee in March 2015, and he was already campaigning at the time. Of course, joining a presidential race early is no guarantee of success. Former Florida Gov. Reubin Askew in the 1984 cycle and ex-Maryland Rep. John Delaney in the 2020 cycle filed with the FEC for the Democratic primary less than a year after the previous presidential election. Neither got very far. Still, on the whole, joining early is better than getting in late. After all, the winners who have gotten in late didn't get that late. The latest, for example, was Republican Ronald Reagan in the 1980 campaign. He entered less than three months after the median candidate.  Biden, in the 2020 cycle, was the other winning candidate to enter more than 15 days after the median candidate.  Both Biden and Reagan shared some qualities that few others had. They had previously run for president and were well known nationally, so they didn't need time to build name recognition or a campaign and fundraising apparatus. What we've seen more often is the late-entering ""savior"" candidate who enters on a white horse -- and fails. Think about former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson in the 2008 cycle and then-Texas Gov. Rick Perry in the 2012 cycle. Both Republicans entered with a splash and proceeded to win zero primaries combined. The same was true for Democrat Mike Bloomberg in the 2020 cycle, though he won American Samoa.  Advantage incumbents For incumbents, meanwhile, there's a much greater ability to wait before indicating publicly that they're going for another term.  The median date, since 1976, for presidents to either form an exploratory committee or announce their campaign is April 30 of the year before the general election. That's about a month and a half later than when the median nonincumbent's campaign gets started.  Some presidents do go early. Trump's failed 2020 reelection campaign started the moment he entered the White House. (He formed an exploratory committee on Inauguration Day.)  Later is the general rule, however, for incumbents. Reagan's highly successful 1984 reelection campaign, for instance, didn't get underway until October 1983. George H.W. Bush, likewise, got going on his 1992 reelection bid in October 1991.  It shouldn't be too surprising that incumbents can afford to go later. They rarely have any major competitors for their party nomination. They have universal name recognition, and incumbents don't need the same amount of time to ramp up their campaign infrastructure to raise money.  All of that seems to match up with what Biden is going through at this point. In fact, some reports suggest he'll likely announce a reelection bid in April.  But for Republicans wondering whether it's too soon to start campaigning, history is pretty clear. It's better to start sooner or you might fall too far behind to recover.

"February 17, 2023 - Russia-Ukraine news",2023-02-16,"Our live coverage for the day has ended. Follow the latest Ukraine news here or read through the updates below. US Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo plans to put Russia and its intelligence services on notice next week: The US is monitoring their efforts to circumvent US sanctions and is cracking down.  ""As we look forward, one of the centerpieces of our strategy will be to counter attempts to evade our sanctions,"" Adeyemo is set to say Tuesday at the Council on Foreign Relations, according to excerpts of his speech obtained by CNN. ""We know Russia is actively seeking ways to circumvent these sanctions. ... In fact, one of the ways we know our sanctions are working is that Russia has tasked its intelligence services — the FSB and GRU — to find ways to get around them."" Adeyemo will deliver the remarks ahead of the first anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, reflecting on the US-led efforts to destabilize the Russian economy and push crushing sanctions to undermine Russian President Vladimir Putin's ability to wage war. His remarks also come as the Kremlin increasingly turns to its clandestine services to avoid Western sanctions.  Since Russia launched its bloody war against Ukraine, the US has imposed thousands of sanctions against Russian politicians, oligarchs and companies, cut off the Russian central bank from its dollar-denominated reserves as well as the global financial messaging system, undermined Russia's defense-industrial base and imposed a price cap on Russian oil and petroleum products. ""The thing that we are doing with our colleagues at Commerce is we're slowing Russia down and our colleagues at the Defense Department are speeding the Ukrainians up. So they're getting them the arms they need to fight off Russia in their country while Commerce and Treasury are slowing down Russia's ability to rearm. We're already seeing a big impact,"" Adeyemo told CNN in an interview ahead of his speech. Despite the impact sanctions have had on the Russian economy, some observers have pointed to concerns over Moscow's ability to evade sanctions and re-orient trade routes to continue to acquire some of the technologies and financing needed to fund its war machine through countries like Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and India.  Read more here Vladyslav Orlov, an officer in Ukraine’s national guard, didn’t see what hit him, but the next thing he knew, the car he was traveling in last October was rolling over and in flames. He suspected Russian gunfire. Pinned in the back seat, Orlov says he was initially unable to get out of the vehicle – his feet had been crushed by the car and his legs had been wounded by the explosion. Once he finally did, he and his team lay in the nearby grass watching the flames and figuring out their next steps, in disbelief they had survived. “Sometimes I really don’t understand what has happened with me, I’m still somewhere on another planet,” Orlov, 27, told CNN. He was eventually taken to a Ukrainian hospital. He was told he may need to have at least one leg amputated or that he may never walk again, in part due to inundated hospitals and strains on resources after months of war. He was told the focus was to save his life, not necessarily his limbs. “(There are) a lot of wounded guys, you know?” Orlov said. “Our doctors, everybody (is) working hard like from morning to evening, working absolutely hard but (there’s) no free space, ya know? (There’s not) enough medicine because it’s war,” he said in limited English. So began the pursuit of another option – any option. Ashley Matkowsky, Orlov’s American girlfriend and a videographer who had been working in Ukraine, recorded what Orlov looked like after the attack. That video caught the attention of some US volunteers and eventually made its way to Gary Wasserson, a retired American businessman from New York who was already coordinating volunteer aid resources to the region. “I sprung into action and started making calls in the United States,” Wasserson told CNN. Read more here  Watch: Given the gigantic advantage that Russia enjoys over Ukraine in terms of aircraft and pilots, it’s staggering that Ukraine can still threaten Russian forces. Indeed it’s baffling that almost one year into the conflict Ukraine has an air force and helicopter fleet at all, given the effort to destroy them. Ukraine's air force and army aviators along with their planes and helicopters are priority prey for Russia’s missiles. They’re likely top of the Kremlin’s list. “We’re always surprised that we’re here. But, well, we are and we’re never going to stop,” says the deputy commander of the Sikorsky Brigade – his name and location are military secrets. Ukraine gets more equipment by capturing it from Russian troops than it gets donated by allies. President Volodymyr Zelensky has begged NATO and other allies for, among other things, jets and other aircraft.  The response so far has been close to nil. The United Kingdom has offered to boost Ukraine’s helicopter fleet with a handful of ancient Sea King aircraft that have been decommissioned from the military. Portugal, meanwhile, has given six Russian-made Ка-32А11VS – none of which are even airworthy and which, its defense minister said, Ukraine would have to fix itself. So, Ukraine’s military is making do.  Ukrainian pilot Serhiy told CNN that his team has set up temporary locations near the front line where they hide fuel and ammunition. Support crews tuck themselves out of sight. Perimeter security exists but it’s invisible. Yuri, a young flier who's paired with another pilot, said teams would benefit from newer fleet.  “All we have are skillful pilots who are flying old helicopters,” he said. “If we had new machines, we would be able to fulfill tasks much better. We would support the infantry better during combat, and of course there would be fewer casualties. Because the system that protects the helicopter is much better in Western models of helicopters.” Read more: More than a million Ukrainians are at risk of losing access to drinking water because Russian forces are meddling with a reservoir in southeast Ukraine, according to Ruslan Strilets, the country's environment minister. Speaking at a media briefing in Kyiv, Strilets accused Russia of deliberately spilling water at the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Plant. His comments echo Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, who on Tuesday accused Russian forces of damaging and intentionally reopening floodgates at the power plant. Strilets said there has been a ""huge drop"" in water levels at the Kakhovka reservoir, which is now sitting at 13.83 meters, compared to the average level of 16 meters. He warned that a drop below 12 meters would be devastating for surrounding habitats. The environment minister said meddling with the reservoir could also endanger the ability to cool reactors at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.  The toll of Russia's attacks on infrastructure: In December, CNN reported that Russia's persistent attacks on Ukraine's energy grid had, at least temporarily, left millions of civilians without electricity, heat, water and other critical services in the bitter winter months. In November, one of Ukraine's largest state hospitals was ""on the verge of evacuating"" some patients after it lost water supply because of Russian air strikes, a regional official told CNN. With previous reporting from CNN's Maria Kostenko, Lauren Kent, Olga Voitovych, Sophie Tanno and Gabriel Kinder. Fierce fighting continues around the strategic eastern city of Bakhmut, where Russian strikes killed five people in the last 24 hours, according to local Ukrainian military leaders. At the Munich Security Conference, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky continues to lobby world leaders for more support as the war creeps up on the one-year mark. Here's what else to know: Russian shelling in the east: Five people were killed and 10 were injured over the last 24 hours by Russian shelling in the Donetsk region, according to Pavlo Kyrylenko, military governor in Donetsk. The deaths occurred in the area of Horlivka, while a majority of the injuries occurred in the city of Bakhmut, an area where fighting has intensified, Kyrylenko said. Russian forces have reinforced their presence around Bakhmut through different units but Ukrainian units continue to try to prevent the city from falling into Russian hands, a Ukrainian military spokesperson said Thursday.
Munich Security Conference: Zelensky told world leaders “there is no alternative to Ukrainian victory"" as he continued to lobby for his country's admission to the EU and NATO. He also urged leaders to ""hurry up"" with additional agreements, delivery of aid and other decisions, a sentiment that was echoed by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz who asked allies to deliver tanks to Ukraine quickly.
Biden to Poland: President Joe Biden will meet with Polish President Andrzej Duda and other NATO leaders during his trip to the country next week, the White House said. Biden is expected to reaffirm the United State's support for Ukraine. It comes as Russia's invasion reaches the one-year mark.
Fighter jets: A group of five bipartisan lawmakers sent a letter to President Biden, requesting his administration send F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine. Asked last month whether the US would be providing the US-made F-16 to Ukraine, Biden responded with a flat “no,” though he later said talks with Kyiv about weapon supplies are ongoing.
Ongoing training: The first group of Ukrainian soldiers completed training at a United States base in Germany, according to the Pentagon, and a second group is already underway. The five-week course is aimed at teaching the troops maneuver, medical and basic soldier training. The course is part of an expanded US program to prepare Ukrainian forces to fight — a sign of US effort to train and prepare Ukrainians for a long-term war.  
Other impacts of the war: The energy crisis triggered by Russia’s war in Ukraine could push 141 million people worldwide into extreme poverty, according to a report published Thursday in the journal Nature Energy. Researchers modeled the impacts of increased energy prices in 116 countries and found household spending increased up to 4.8% on average, as coal and natural gas prices surged after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, adding to post-pandemic increases. ##Catch Up## The US government estimates the private military company Wagner Group has suffered more than 30,000 casualties, including roughly 9,000 fighters killed, since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. About half of those 9,000 have been killed since mid-December, US National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said. And about 90% of those killed in December were recruited from Russian prisons. The group has relied heavily on convicts to fill out its ranks. ""That doesn't show any signs of abating,"" Kirby said Friday, though Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin claimed last week that he will no longer recruit from prisons. ""They're treating their recruits, largely convicts, as basically cannon fodder, throwing them into a literal meat grinder here, inhuman ways without a second thought,"" Kirby said. ""Men that he just plucked out of prisons and threw on the battlefield with no training, no equipping, no organizational command, just throw them into the fight."" Recently, Wagner suffered heavy casualties in the intense fight for the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut. Kirby said Russia made ""incremental gains"" in and around the city as the fighting intensified over the last several days. He said the US cannot predict whether Russia will break through. Even if they do, Kirby said the city holds ""no real strategic value,"" because the US believes Ukraine would maintain its strong defensive lines across the broader Donbas region. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday that the US has “deep concern” about Russia's efforts to destabilize the government of Moldova.  This comes as Moldova President Maia Sandu said earlier this week that Russia was plotting a coup in Moldova. “We have deep concern about some of the plotting that we’ve seen coming from Russia to try to destabilize the government,” Blinken said at a meeting with Sandu in Germany on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference. “We stand strongly with Moldova in support of its security, its independence, its territorial integrity, the very important reform efforts that the president and the government are making."" Sandu described 2022 as an “incredibly difficult year for Moldova” and thanked the US for its support with its myriad challenges, including with energy, the economy and security. Why Moldova is important: Moldova, situated between Ukraine and Romania, was previously part of the Soviet Union at the end of World War II. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, a handful of “frozen conflict” zones in eastern Europe emerged, including a slither of land along Moldova’s border with Ukraine known as Transnistria. The territory declared itself a Soviet republic in 1990, opposing any attempt by Moldova to become an independent state or to merge with Romania. When Moldova became independent the following year, Russia quickly inserted itself as a so-called “peacekeeping force” in Transnistria, sending troops in to back pro-Moscow separatists there. This supposed “peacekeeping” presence, which has in practice seen the Kremlin prop up a puppet state that seeks to undermine Moldova’s sovereignty, has also mirrored Moscow’s pretext for invasions in Georgia and Ukraine. Alarm bells in Moldova and the West grew louder following familiar refrains from the Kremlin that the rights of ethnic Russians were being violated in Transnistria – another argument used by Putin to justify his February 2022 invasion of Luhansk and Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, which contained two breakaway Russian-backed statelets. In the context of the war today, the Russian-backed separatist enclave at the southwestern edge of the country could now present a potential bookend to any Russian assault westwards from Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region. ##Munich Conference##  President Joe Biden will meet with Polish President Andrzej Duda during his trip next week to thank him for the military and humanitarian assistance Warsaw has provided to Ukraine, the White House said. The president will also deliver remarks and meet with the Bucharest Nine, the group of Eastern flank NATO allies, John Kirby, the National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications, said.   The trip ""comes at an important moment"" as Russia's invasion of Ukraine reaches the one-year mark, Kirby said. Biden meets with Duda on Tuesday morning.   ""President Biden will thank President Duda and, in fact, the Polish people for the $3.8 billion in military and humanitarian assistance that they have provided to Ukraine over the past year. And for all the efforts that the Polish people have done to generously welcome more than one and a half million refugees from Ukraine,"" Kirby said.   During his meeting with leaders of the Bucharest Nine on Wednesday, Biden will ""reaffirm the United States' unwavering support,"" according to Kirby. The first group of Ukrainian soldiers completed training at a United States base in Germany, the Pentagon said. A second group is already underway in the five-week course that will teach the troops maneuver, medical and basic soldier training. The first group of 635 Ukrainians wrapped up the course at Grafenwoehr Training Area, according to a statement from Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder, where the US conducts its own combined arms and maneuver training. The Ukrainian battalion also trained on the Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle.   More on the training: The training began in mid-January, part of an expanded US program to prepare Ukrainian forces to fight. Previously, the US had offered smaller-scale training on individual weapons systems, such as HIMARS rocket launchers. The transition to battalion-level training marked a significant expansion of the US effort to train and prepare Ukrainians for a long-term war.   A second group of 710 Ukrainian forces has already begun training at Grafenwoehr, Ryder said. The troops will train on the Bradley infantry fighting vehicle and the M109 Paladin, a self-propelled howitzer that the US recently announced it will send to Ukraine. In addition, another 890 Ukrainian troops will begin training on Stryker fighting vehicles next week.   Republican Texas Rep. Michael McCaul, who chairs the US House Foreign Affairs Committee, told Kaitlan Collins on CNN This Morning that the United States should give Ukrainians ""everything they need to win this thing.""  ""We can’t wait,"" McCaul said while speaking from the Munich Security Conference in Germany. He reiterated Ukraine's call for Western fighter jets and more advanced weaponry ahead of a Russian offensive.  ""Time only errs on the side of Putin. It’s his goal to delay this for as long as possible, for many reasons,” McCaul argued, cautioning that “the sooner we can bring this to a closing the better, as we look at the will of the American people and the Congress.” When asked if he thought the new Russian offensive had begun yet, McCaul responded, “I do think it’s going to start soon. I know that the new general that Putin put in place is there to launch a major offensive,” continuing that “Putin does look at dates. I think February 24th, the one-year anniversary may be a target date. We just heard from the Supreme Allied Commander in a private briefing I had with him, that it could be as late as the springtime, late springtime, for this offensive.” McCaul said he asked in the aforementioned meeting about more air-to-surface aircraft for Ukraine and US Army Gen. Christopher Cavoli, NATO’s supreme allied commander, “agreed with that assessment, as well as longer range artillery to hit the Iranian drones in Crimea, which currently Ukraine does not have, but they desperately need."" When asked if he believes he could get another round of funding for Ukraine passed in this Congress, McCaul replied, “I believe so. It would have to be bipartisan” he said, because “there are fringes on the far-left and -right who disagree with this conflict and assisting and helping Ukraine win this fight for democracy and freedom, but the majority of the majority still support this effort."" Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell tried to assure the audience at the conference that top Republicans currently in Washington are committed to US global leadership despite a mixed message that may have come from former President Donald Trump, who he didn’t cite by name. The Kentucky Republican went on to pledge GOP support for NATO, Ukraine, and boosting military spending and argued Republicans are making a stronger rhetorical case day to day about those issues that President Joe Biden is. He also chided European allies and said they must “mirror” the commitment the US is making said they have not been “uniformly generous towards Ukraine.” He urged them to prepare to counter the robust threats coming China and Russia and to quickly admit Finland and Sweden into NATO.  CNN's Ted Barrett contributed reporting to this post.  ##Munich Conference##  US Vice President Kamala Harris greeted French President Emanuel Macron ahead of a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference Friday. The meeting is aimed at highlighting the two nations’ commitment to providing military aid to Ukraine following Russia’s invasion nearly one year ago. “It is good to see you again, we have talked about so many issues of the moment and future, over the course of our visits,” Harris told the French president. “And to see you again here in Munich, and talk about, as a priority, our commitment, as a partner, to the people of Ukraine and many other issues. This is part of our continuing conversation that is the testament to the friendship and the partnership over many generations, including today.”   For his part, Macron thanked Harris for her hospitality during his visit to Washington, DC, last year. Neither Harris nor Macron responded to questions from the media on Russia or on the US Inflation Reduction Act, which France has criticized.  ##Munich Conference## German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Friday that it is “wise to be prepared for a long war” in Ukraine, adding that Kyiv's allies will remain together for the duration. “I think it is wise to be prepared for a long war and it is wise to give Putin the message that we are ready to just stay all the time together with Ukraine, and that we will constantly support the country,” Scholz told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour at Germany’s annual Munich Security Conference. “The really important decision we should take all together is saying that we are willing to do it as long as necessary, and that we will do our best,” the chancellor said. Scholz, while avoiding committing to an end target date for the war, said the unity among Ukrainian allies has surprised Putin. “I'm absolutely sure that Putin never expected that there would be that united Europe, and that there would be that united world. He never thought that the transatlantic partnership would work that good,” he said. Scholz singled out the United States for their continuous and vital support. ""We just do it together with our friends and partners, and especially with the United States,” Scholz said, adding that he really appreciates his government's “strong alliance” with the US. On arming Ukraine: Amanpour asked Scholz about the deployment of more German-made Leopard 2 tanks on the ground in Ukraine. Scholz said more would be deployed “very soon,” together with trained soldiers, but he warned that many of Ukraine’s partners aren’t able to deliver the most modern models of the fighting vehicles. “I learned many are not able to deliver the most modern things ... but in the ones they are delivering we will give the support as well,"" Scholz said. ""And as you know, there is also a big number of older tanks which we will deliver."" Confronted on concerns over dwindling ammunition stockpiles, Scholz stressed the need for a “permanent production of the most important weapons,” including ammunition. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius was also present at Friday's meetings, saying the Munich conference is ""more important than ever,"" given the Russian invasion. “From the beginning, the security conference has always been a place of understanding and dialogue. What is new is that this is now taking place at the same time as a war of aggression is being waged on European soil by Russia against Ukraine,"" Pistorius said. ""That raises the stakes for the conference even higher."" CNN’s Inke Kappeler contributed to this report from Berlin. ##Munich Conference## A group of five bipartisan lawmakers sent a letter to US President Joe Biden, requesting his administration send F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine. The effort by members likely won’t change anything or impact the administration’s decisions in what it sends to Ukraine, but it comes just ahead of the one-year anniversary of the war’s start and President Joe Biden's trip to Poland.  The letter was signed by Reps. Jared Golden, a Democrat from Maine; Tony Gonzales, a Republican from Texas; Jason Crow, a Democrat from Colorado; Chrissy Houlahan, a Democrat from Pennsylvania; and Mike Gallagher, a Republican from Wisconsin.  “It is in that spirit of leadership and support that we write to respectfully request that your Administration provide Ukraine with increased air superiority capability, including the F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft requested by Kiev, or similar fourth-generation aircraft, as soon as possible. The provision of such aircraft is necessary to help Ukraine protect its airspace, particularly in light of renewed Russian offensives and considering the expected increase in large-scale combat operations,” the letter says. Some background: Since securing pledges for hundreds of modern battle tanks from Western allies, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has turned his attention to modern fighting planes. It was a key element of his pitches during visits to London and a European Union summit last week. Asked last month whether the US would be providing the US-made F-16 to Ukraine, Biden responded with a flat “no,” though he later said talks with Kyiv about weapon supplies are ongoing. Belarus is ready to launch the production of Sukhoi Su-25 ground attack aircraft, which ""have proved to be efficient in Ukraine,"" Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko told Russian President Vladimir Putin during a meeting Friday, according to Belarus state news agency BelTA. “As I was informed by the government, they are ready for the production of the Sukhoi Su-25 attack aircraft that have proved to be efficient in Ukraine. We are even ready to produce them in Belarus if the Russian Federation provides a little bit of technological support,” Lukashenko told Putin, according to BelTA.  “You once raised the question of cooperation in aircraft production in the Eurasian Economic Union,"" Lukashenko said, according to BelTA. ""So I should tell you that the Belarusians are already producing up to a thousand component parts for the MC-21 [Russia's medium-range narrow-body passenger aircraft] and Sukhoi Superjet 100 [Russia's short-range narrow-body passenger aircraft]."" ""We have three factories: two military and one civilian. They used to be repair shops. Today they produce component parts,” Lukashenko said, according to BelTA. The two met Friday at Putin's official residence in Novo-Ogaryovo in the Moscow region, according to the Kremlin.  Lukashenko claimed on Thursday there is “no way” his country would send troops into Ukraine unless it is attacked, and said Russia has “never asked” him to start a joint war in Ukraine. Speaking at a small gathering of journalists from international media, including CNN, at Minsk’s Palace of Independence, Lukashenko ducked questions from international media about his country’s complicity in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and instead blamed the West for escalating the conflict by sending weapons to Ukraine.  CNN's Frederik Pleitgen and Zahra Ullah contributed to this post.  Allies with the resources to deliver tanks to Ukraine should act quickly, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said at the Munich Security Conference on Friday, adding that Berlin would provide great assistance to encourage their partners.  “I see this as an example of the kind of leadership which everyone is entitled to expect from Germany, and I expressly offer it to our friends and partners.” Scholz said. In addition to supplying weapons, ammunition, training for soldiers and other military goods, Scholz said Germany has supported Ukraine by providing more than one million Ukrainian refugees with full access to labor market, schools and universities.  This is the ""responsibility which a country of Germany's size, location and economic clout has to shoulder in times such as these,” Scholz said. However, Scholz also warned that there needs to be “a balance between providing the best possible support for Ukraine and avoiding an unintended escalation.”  “I believe we will do well to carefully weigh up all the consequences of our actions and closely coordinate all key steps among the allies,"" he said. ""Despite all the pressure to take action — and that undoubtedly exists in this key question — caution must take priority over hasty decisions.” ##Munich Conference##  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told world leaders at the Munich Security Conference on Friday that “there is no alternative to Ukrainian victory"" as he continued to lobby for his country's admission to the EU and NATO.  “There is no alternative to Ukraine in the EU. There is no alternative to Ukraine in NATO. There is no alternative to our unity,“ Zelensky said via video.  People, Europe and freedom cannot be the “subject of compromise,” he added. Zelensky told leaders that he hopes that in upcoming years, the conference will be held in post-war conditions where Ukraine is free. The Ukrainian leader also provided his assessment on Russian President Vladimir Putin's strategy, saying “it’s obvious that Ukraine is not going to be his last stop. He’s going to continue his movement all the way — I don’t know — including all other states that at some point in time were part of … the Soviet bloc.” ##Munich Conference##  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urged leaders Friday at the Munich Security Conference Friday to “hurry up” with agreements, delivery and decisions. “We need to hurry up. We need the speed, the speed of our agreements, speed of our delivery to strengthen […] speed of our decisions to limit Russian potential. There is no alternative to speed because it is the speed that the life depends on,” Zelensky said at the conference via videolink.  “Delay has always been and still is a mistake. While we negotiate how to strengthen our defense with modern tanks, the Kremlin is thinking, thinking about ways to strangle Moldova,” Zelensky said. Zelensky opened the conference with other world leaders set to speak including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron.  Remember: In recent weeks, Zelensky and other top Ukrainian officials have been pushing for fighter jets, arguing they need them urgently to defend against Russian missile and drone attacks. Earlier this month, the Ukrainian government officially asked the Netherlands for American-made F-16 fighter jets. ##Munich Conference##  Russian President Vladimir Putin said he plans to discuss mutual plans of military cooperation with his Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko during their Friday meeting at Putin’s official residence in Novo-Ogaryovo near Moscow. Lukashenko, in turn, said that Belarus has fulfilled its obligations to Russia in the sphere of security and defense in 2022. Remember: Russia used the territory of Belarus as one of its entry points for the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Joint military drills over the last year between Belarus and Russia have contributed to concerns that Belarusian troops could join Russia's forces in Ukraine, but Lukashenko has repeatedly dismissed speculation that his troops would join the fighting in Ukraine. This includes a rare press conference from the Belarusian strongman in Minsk on Thursday, where he said he would not send troops to Ukraine unless Belarus is attacked, but also defiantly declared that Russia is a staunch ally of his country.    It is ""unlikely"" that Russian forces will meet the goal of capturing the symbolic city of Bakhmut by the one-year anniversary of the invasion, according to an assessment by the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) published Thursday. Capturing Bakhmut by February 24 ""would require a significantly higher rate of Russian advance than anything seen for many months,"" researchers said. They had previously assessed that the Ukrainian defense of Bakhmut ""would likely prevent Putin from claiming that Russian forces secured the city on the anniversary of the invasion in an attempt to renew hope in a Russian victory in Ukraine."" The think tank warns that the Kremlin may launch ""another series of missile strikes on civilian targets throughout Ukraine to mark the symbolic anniversary as actual military success continues to evade the Russian military."" A Ukrainian military spokesperson said Thursday that Russian forces have reinforced their presence around Bakhmut through different units — air defense, special forces, mechanized infantry and private military contractor group Wagner — but Ukrainian units continue to try to prevent the city from falling into Russian hands. But ""time will tell"" how much Russia is able to gain by February 24, Serhii Cherevatyi, spokesperson for the Eastern Grouping of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, said Thursday on Ukrainian television. ""Our soldiers have been fighting for many months ... For more than seven months, Bakhmut has become an absolute symbol of heroism and courage."" US Vice President Kamala Harris is set to join world leaders at the Munich Security Conference in Germany, where the war in Ukraine will be at the top of the agenda. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron will be among those speaking Friday, the first day of the three-day summit, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will appear by videolink. The conference comes just days ahead of the one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on February 24. Catch up on the latest developments:  Soaring energy costs could push millions into extreme poverty, report says: The energy crisis triggered by Russia’s war in Ukraine could push 141 million people worldwide into extreme poverty, according to a report published Thursday in the journal Nature Energy. Researchers modeled the impacts of increased energy prices in 116 countries and found household spending increased up to 4.8% on average, as coal and natural gas prices surged after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, adding to post-pandemic increases.
Russian shelling kills 3 and injures 7 in Kherson region: Three people were killed and seven were injured by Russian shelling in Ukraine's Kherson region on Thursday, the Kherson region military administration said in a statement Friday. Russian forces attacked the Kherson region 76 times over the last 24 hours, the regional military administration said. ""They fired from MLRS, mortars, artillery, tanks and UAVs,"" it added.
Russian shelling kills 5, injures 10 in Donetsk region: Meanwhile, Russian shelling killed 5 residents of the Donetsk region and injured 10 others over the last 24 hours, the Donetsk region military governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said in a Facebook post Friday. The deaths occurred in the area of Horlivka, while the majority of the injuries occurred in the city of Bakhmut, Kyrylenko said.
Kremlin says Washington ""unlikely"" to welcome Lukashenko’s suggestion of three-way summit with Putin and Biden: The Kremlin said Friday that Washington is “unlikely” to welcome the initiative put forward by Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko to mediate talks between US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin. On Thursday, Lukashenko said he wants to host peace talks, calling on CNN to relay the message. ##Catch Up## Russia launched a total of 36 air and sea-based cruise missiles, guided air-to-surface missiles and anti-ship missiles at Ukraine overnight into Thursday, according to Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.  Zaluzhnyi said 14 cruise missiles and 2 guided air-to-surface missiles were shot down by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The pictures below show a Ukrainian emergency services team securing the remains of an S-300 missile fired by Russian forces in Kharkiv, Ukraine, on Friday. Here's a look: Russian shelling has killed 5 residents of the Donetsk region and injured 10 others over the last 24 hours, the Donetsk region military governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said in a Facebook post Friday. The deaths occurred in the area of Horlivka, while the majority of the injuries occurred in the city of Bakhmut, Kyrylenko said. In Bakhmut, 10 high-rise buildings, 3 private houses and an administrative building were damaged, he said. Two houses were also damaged by Russian shelling in the city of Lyman. Some of the heaviest shelling was also reported in the areas of Vuhledar and Soledar, Kyrylenko said. The Kremlin said Friday that Washington is “unlikely” to welcome the initiative put forward by Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko to mediate talks between US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin. “It is unlikely that Washington will respond positively to this initiative,” Putin’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said during a regular press briefing. Pressed further if the Kremlin is ready for such a meeting in principle, Peskov said: “President Putin is always ready for a dialogue with the president of Belarus, who will be in Moscow today.” On Thursday, Lukashenko said he wants to host peace talks, calling on CNN to relay the message: “If Biden has a desire, pass on to him through your channels that we are ready to welcome him in Minsk and have a serious talk with him if he wishes for peace in Ukraine. Even Putin will fly to Minsk, and we can meet here, the three of us -- two aggressors and a peace-loving President. Why not?”  Putin is expected to hold talks with Lukashenko in his Novo-Ogaryovo residence Friday. The two presidents are planning to consider “key issues of further development of Russian-Belarusian relations of strategic partnership and alliance, as well as integration cooperation within the framework of the Union State,” according to the Kremlin.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will also appear by videolink.  The conference comes just ahead of the one-year anniversary of of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on February 24. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell are among other top officials in attendance.  European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a tweet on Friday morning: ""It has now been almost one year since Russia brought an imperialistic war to our continent. At the @MunSecConf, let us renew our commitment to a global order governed by the rule of law – not the right of might."" Russian government officials were not invited to this year’s annual MSC. ##Munich Conference## Three people were killed and seven were injured by Russian shelling in Ukraine's Kherson region on Thursday, the Kherson region military administration said in a statement Friday. Russian forces attacked Kherson region 76 times over the last 24 hours, the regional military administration said. ""They fired from MLRS, mortars, artillery, tanks and UAVs,"" it added. ""The Russian army attacked Kherson city 9 times -- residential areas of the city once again came under enemy fire,"" the regional military administration said.  ""The occupiers hit the commercial port and residential buildings,"" the regional military administration added. Some background: The regional capital of Kherson was captured last March in the early stages of Russia’s invasion, and many of its 290,000 citizens left then. In November, Ukrainian forces swept into the key city as Russian troops retreated to the east, delivering a major victory to Kyiv. Since then, Kherson has been the scene of Russian shelling, and many residents have fled, on the advice of Ukraine's administration.  A Ukrainian drone was shot down Friday morning near a power station in the Crimean city of Sevastopol, according to a local Russia-backed official. Gov. Mikhail Razvozhaev said in a Telegram post that air defenses shot the drone down near the Balaklava thermal power plant and there was no damage to the facility. It comes after two Ukrainian drones were shot down overnight into Thursday near Sevastopol and ""several more"" unmanned aerial vehicles were shot down over the waters around the Crimean Peninsula, according to Razvozhaev. Razvozhaev claimed the Ukrainians ""have not abandoned their attempts to strike important facilities for Sevastopol."" CNN cannot independently confirm Razvozhaev’s claim. Some context: Sevastopol, along with the rest of Crimea, is internationally recognized as being part of Ukraine. It is the largest city in the peninsula and has been an important port and a major naval base for Russia’s Black Sea Fleet. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has vowed to “liberate” all of the country’s territory including Crimea, which has been under Russian occupation since 2014. Inside a sprawling factory just off the President Biden Expressway in downtown Scranton, Pennsylvania, the future arsenal of Ukraine’s war effort is being forged, one red hot artillery shell at a time. Running full-tilt, as it was on a recent January morning, the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant churns out roughly 11,000 artillery shells a month. That may seem like a lot, but the Ukrainian military often fires that many shells over just a few days. To meet that demand, the Scranton plant is undergoing a massive expansion, fueled by millions of dollars in new defense spending from the Pentagon. It’s investing in new high-tech machinery, hiring a few dozen additional workers and will eventually shift to a 24/7 schedule of constant production. “It’s certainly ramped up over the last year. As we bring in more modern equipment, it’ll be able to ramp up even further,” said Todd Smith, senior director of General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems, which operates the plant for the Army. “Intensity has gone up,” Smith added. “Let’s just put it that way.” The US and its allies have already sent nearly $50 billion in aid and equipment to Ukraine’s military over the past year. To keep that up, and to rebuild its own stockpiles, the Pentagon is racing to re-arm, embarking on the biggest increase in ammunition production in decades, and putting portions of the US defense industry on a war-footing despite America technically not being at war. Read the full story: The energy crisis triggered by Russia’s war in Ukraine could push 141 million people worldwide into extreme poverty, according to a report published Thursday in the journal Nature Energy. Researchers from the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, China and the United States modeled the impacts of increased energy prices in 116 countries and found household spending increased up to 4.8% on average, as coal and natural gas prices surged after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, adding to post-pandemic increases. In low-income countries, the report said poorer households already facing severe food shortages were at greater risk of poverty due to higher energy costs. Households in higher income countries also felt the impact of rising energy prices but were more likely to be able to absorb them into household budgets, the report said. Read the full story here. Russian strikes around the fiercely embattled Ukrainian city of Bakhmut left three men and two women dead Thursday, according to a regional official, and nine other civilians also sustained various wounds from shrapnel. The five civilians killed varied in age between 32 and 66, according to a statement published online by the Donetsk region prosecutor's office. The statement said the shelling also damaged many residential buildings. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk appealed to the civilians who remain in Bakhmut to leave the city immediately. ""Frankly speaking, I am very surprised that there are still 6,000 civilians there (in Bakhmut),"" she wrote on Telegram citing the latest data. ""Those who choose to stay in Bakhmut are endangering themselves and loved ones,"" creating additional risks for the military and police, and ""preventing our defense and security forces from working properly in the city,"" she said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky would not agree to give up any Ukrainian territory in a potential future peace deal with Russia, he said in an interview with BBC News, warning it could lead Russia to ""keep coming back."" ""Any territorial compromises would make us weaker as a state,"" Zelensky told BBC News. ""It's not about compromise itself. Why would we fear that? There are millions of compromises in life. The question is with whom? Compromise with Putin? No. Because there's no trust."" Zelensky also said a spring offensive, warned of by Kyiv officials, had already begun. ""Russian attacks are already happening from several directions,"" he said. He also responded to comments made at a Thursday news conference by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, in which Lukashenko insisted he would not send troops into Ukraine unless Belarus itself is attacked. ""I hope [Belarus] won't join [the war],"" Zelensky told BBC News. ""If it does, we will fight and we will survive."" Zelensky added it would be a ""huge mistake"" to allow Russia to use Belarus as a staging area for an attack. European leaders must “seriously consider” providing Kyiv with fighter jets, lawmakers in the European Union parliament said in a resolution adopted Thursday. The resolution marked nearly one year since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.   “They reaffirm their support for providing military assistance to Ukraine for as long as is necessary and call for serious consideration to be given to delivering Western fighter jets and helicopters, appropriate missile systems and substantial increases in munitions delivery to Kyiv,” according to a satement.  “Ukraine must not only be able to defend itself, but also to regain full control of its entire internationally recognised territory,"" it added. The resolution, which is non-binding, also calls on the EU to implement a 10th package of sanctions against Moscow by the end of February and to tighten those already in place. Assets seized from Russian oligarchs should be used to fund Ukraine’s reconstruction, lawmakers said.  The legislators also urged the European Commission — the EU’s executive arm — and national governments to begin talks with Kyiv this year on Ukraine's bid for EU membership. Russian response: The Russian Mission to the EU slammed the parliament’s resolution as a “paragon of disinformation” unsupported by “data, facts or evidence,” in a statement posted on its website. ""Obviously, the resolution is aimed at deliberately misleading the European public and trying to justify the European Union's course to escalate the Ukrainian conflict and increase sanctions pressure on our country,"" the mission said. Moscow has faced constant diplomatic pressure from the EU, including economic sanctions, since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his forces to invade Ukraine. More background: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky took his plea for the supply of Western fighter jets directly to European countries last week, including in a surprise visit to London and at a European Union summit. Ukrainian pilots will start training on NATO jets in the United Kingdom soon, but it's unclear how soon allies could make a decision on whether to send the modern fighting planes. NATO's secretary general said Tuesday that the question of sending modern fighter jets to Ukraine is ""not the most urgent issue"" right now, focusing instead on delivering the military support it has already committed to Ukraine.  Ukrainian authorities said on Thursday that Russia attacked infrastructure facilities in the Lviv and Kirovohrad regions. Three missiles hit a critical infrastructure facility in the Drohobych district of the western Lviv region, according to the head of the district's military administration Stepan Kulyniak. There were no injuries, but ""a number of buildings were destroyed and damaged,"" Kulyniak said in a social media post. He did not specify what type of infrastructure facility was hit.  Meanwhile, in the Kirovhohrad region, authorities said an early morning missile attack hit ""reservoirs with petroleum products,"" causing a fire that was later extinguished.  ""None of the service personnel was injured. People living near this facility were not injured either. The damage was done to the houses they live in,"" said Andrii Raikovych, the head of the Kirovohrad region military administration. Raikovych added that authorities will inspect and repair the damage to residential buildings. Russia’s newly declared offensive is “very pathetic,” according to a top US State Department official, who questioned whether the Russian people would continue to support the war in Ukraine. “You see the war grinding in the east, in Bakhmut,” said US Under Secretary for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland. “Russia has declared that it is launching a new offensive. Well, if this is it, it is very pathetic, I would say.” She said Ukraine is planning its own counteroffensive “for later on.” Nuland also said that Russian President Vladimir Putin “is arrogant enough to believe that he can defeat Ukraine.” “I think the more interesting question is whether the Russian people will stand for this, given how many of their sons they are losing, more than 200,000 Russians killed in action or wounded in action over the course of the year. They have in some categories lost more than half of their military equipment in this war, and more than a million of the brightest and best Russians have left the country,” she said.
“So what is this war bringing the average Russian? Nothing. Death, destruction, loss of a future, loss of the technological and economic potential that would come from being integrated with us. So what is more interesting is whether the Russian people will stand for this.” More on Bakhmut: Earlier this month, the head of Russia’s Wagner private military group said the capture of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine was far from imminent. “Bakhmut will not be taken tomorrow, because there is heavy resistance and grinding, the meat grinder is working,” Yevgeniy Prigozhin said in a statement distributed on a Wagner Telegram channel. “For the meat grinder to work properly, it is impossible to suddenly start festivities. There won't be any festivities anytime soon.” CNN's Mick Krever contributed to this post. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has claimed there is “no way” his country would send troops into Ukraine unless it is attacked, amid fears Russia’s close ally will help to facilitate a spring offensive by Moscow. “We are peaceful people. We know what war is and we don’t want war,” the authoritarian leader Lukashenko, who has close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, said at a small gathering of journalists from international media, including CNN, at Minsk’s Palace of Independence. “There is no way we are going to send our troops to Ukraine unless you are going to commit aggression against Belarus,” Lukashenko said. “But don’t forget Russia is our ally, legally, morally and politically.” The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, meanwhile announced that Putin will meet with Lukashenko in the Moscow region on Friday. Belarus helped Russia launch its initial invasion of Ukraine last February, allowing the Kremlin’s troops to enter the country through the 1,000-kilometer (621-mile) Ukrainian-Belarusian border to the north of Kyiv. Minsk has since claimed on numerous occasions that Ukrainian drones and missiles have entered its territory, sometimes without providing evidence.

Analysis: Fox News has been exposed as a dishonest organization terrified of its own audience,2023-02-17,"Fox News has been exposed like never before.  A trove of newly-released text messages and emails have laid bare how the right-wing media giant operated with little regard for fact in the weeks and months following the 2020 presidential election. The correspondence reveals that the network's senior-most executives and highest-profile hosts chose not to disclose what they believed to be the truth of the election out of fear that that the facts would alienate Fox News' audience and throw the highly profitable business into ruin. The messages were contained in a stunning legal filing made public on Thursday as part of Dominion Voting Systems' $1.6 billion lawsuit against Fox News, showing the network's executives and talk hosts privately trashing lies pushed by former President Donald Trump's camp and his supporters asserting the 2020 election was rigged. But, despite privately acknowledging the realiity of the situation, the network allowed the lies to take hold on its air, in large part because executives and hosts were terrified that telling its sizable audience the truth would prompt them to tune out. After the election, an incensed Trump had attacked Fox News and encouraged his followers to switch to Newsmax, a smaller right-wing talk channel that was saturating its airwaves with election denialism.  Trump was enraged that Fox News was the first network to call the critical swing state of Arizona for now-president Joe Biden. And he couldn't stand that the network, rightfully, declared Biden as the winner of the presidential contest. In the days and weeks after the presidential contest had been called, Fox News' audience listened to Trump and rebelled against the channel. Fox News shed a chunk of its audience while Newsmax gained significant viewership. Behind the scenes, Fox News executives and hosts were in panic. Jay Wallace, the Fox News president, described Newsmax's surge as ""troubling"" and said the network needed to be ""on war footing."" Rupert Murdoch, the Fox Corporation chairman, emailed Suzanne Scott, the Fox News chief executive, telling her that Newsmax needed to be ""watched."" Murdoch said that he didn't ""want to antagonize Trump further"" and stressed to her, ""everything at stake here."" The messages underscore that Fox News did not live up to the basic journalistic principle that news organizations are supposed to deliver the news to viewers, without fear or favor. Instead, the right-wing talk channel engineered its coverage to appeal to its audience which was actively being lied to by Trump and his campaign surrogates. ""Our viewers are good people and they believe [the election fraud claims],"" Tucker Carlson acknowledged in one message to Laura Ingraham. A week after the election had been called, Sean Hannity told Carlson and Ingraham, ""In one week and one debate they destroyed a brand that took 25 years to build and the damage is incalculable."" ""It's vandalism,"" Carlson responded. Hannity then discussed the damage a competitor could really do to Fox News, describing it as a potentially ""serious problem.""  ""That could happen,"" Carlson replied.  The hosts were so alarmed by Newsmax's rise, they were enraged when their colleague, White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich, tweeted a mere fact check of Trump's election lies. ""Please get her fired,"" Carlson told Hannity. ""Seriously What the f**k? I'm actually shocked. It needs to stop immediately, like tonight. It's measurably hurting the company. The stock price is down. Not a joke."" Hannity said he had already spoken to Scott about the matter. He then proceeded to criticize two of his other colleagues, Fox News host Neil Cavuto and then-Fox News anchor Chris Wallace, both of whom were critical of Trump. ""I'm 3 strikes,"" Hannity said. ""Wallace s**t debate[.] Election night a disaster[.] Now this BS? Nope. Not gonna fly. Did I mention Cavuto?"" The fear that Fox News' audience would abandon it for good also appeared to drive programming decisions. In the days following the election, Alex Pfeiffer, a Carlson producer, told the host, ""Many viewers were upset tonight that we didn't cover election fraud .... It's all our viewers care about right now.""  Carlson said the decision was a ""mistake,"" adding, ""I just hate this s**t."" Executives at Fox were so worried about their audience protesting the channel that Scott, the network chief executive, even made an overture to MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, a prominent Fox News advertiser and election conspiracy theorist. When Lindell appeared on Newsmax and criticized Fox News, executives at Fox News ""exchanged worried emails about alienating him,"" the legal filing said. The filing added that Scott then sent him a handwritten note along with a gift. In a statement Thursday night, Fox News argued that the court filing contained cherry-picked quotes lacking context. ""There will be a lot of noise and confusion generated by Dominion and their opportunistic private equity owners, but the core of this case remains about freedom of the press and freedom of speech, which are fundamental rights afforded by the Constitution and protected by New York Times v. Sullivan,"" the network said.","{'neg': 0.45, 'neu': 0.55, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.8402}",45,121.0,0.158,0.79325,0.04875,-0.3740875,0.164,0.757,0.079,-0.9979,-16.8339375,189.78492361111114,479.0,0.396210696474136
Feds are sending medical experts to Ohio toxic train wreck site as residents' safety concerns simmer,2023-02-17,"The Biden administration said it has deployed federal medical experts to help assess what dangers remain at an Ohio village where a train carrying hazardous materials derailed this month -- a ramp-up of federal support at the governor's request as anxious residents point to signs of adverse effects. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine on Thursday asked the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Department of Health and Human Services to send teams to East Palestine, where the train derailed February 3 and sparked a dayslong blaze. ""This request for medical experts includes, but is not limited to, physicians and behavioral health specialists,"" DeWine wrote in a letter to the CDC. ""Some community members have already seen physicians in the area but remain concerned about their condition and possible health effects -- both short- and long-term."" The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed Friday it will be sending a team to ""assess the public health needs"" at the site of the derailment. ""CDC is working closely with US EPA and the Ohio Department of Health to assess the public health impact of the train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio. We will be sending a team to provide technical assistance and assess the public health needs,"" CDC spokesperson Bert Kelly told CNN in a statement on Friday. It is in addition to aid the Federal Emergency Management Agency is providing, according to Jean-Pierre, who noted Thursday the train derailment situation is ""much more expansive"" than what FEMA can offer. The federal support boost to a community of some 5,000 people along the Ohio-Pennsylvania state line comes amid some residents' growing concerns some areas may not be safe to live in. There have been at least eight class action lawsuits filed in Ohio courts following the derailment two weeks ago. The lawsuits, pending in the United States District Court of Northern Ohio, similarly accuse Norfolk Southern of negligence, saying the company failed to keep residents and businesses safe among other claims. Norfolk Southern told CNN they were ""unable to comment on litigation,"" following the announcement of the first lawsuit. An evacuation order in place for areas near the crash site was lifted February 8 after officials said air and water sample results led them to deem the area safe, officials said. But a chemical stench lingered in areas, with some residents saying the odor left them with headaches and pains in their throat. Plus, officials estimate thousands of fish were killed by contamination washing down streams and rivers. Further spurring residents' questions about safety -- some of which were expressed at an emotional community meeting Wednesday -- were crews' decision to conduct controlled detonations February 6 of some tanks carrying toxic chemicals to prevent a more dangerous explosion. Though a larger blast was averted, the detonations essentially released chemicals into the air, including vinyl chloride, which at high levels could increase cancer risk or cause death. On Thursday, the head of the federal Environmental Agency Administration visited East Palestine and vowed to use the agency's enforcement authority to hold the train operator, Norfolk Southern, accountable. ""I want the community to know that we hear you, we see you, and that we will get to the bottom of this,"" EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan said Thursday during a news conference. ""We are testing for all volatile organic chemicals. We're testing for everything. We're testing for everything that was on that train. So, we feel comfortable that we are casting a net wide enough to present a picture that will protect the community."" During the visit, Regan observed some of the ongoing remediation efforts following the hazardous train derailment. While the state EPA has the primary responsibility over the scene, Regan noted the federal arm is ready to provide aid when needed. Regan also noted Norfolk Southern has signed a notice of accountability, acknowledging the company will be responsible for the cleanup. Former President Donald Trump is also planning to travel to East Palestine on Wednesday to meet with community members, according to a source familiar with his expected travel. His team is still working out details ahead of the trip.  Governor speaks on air and water safety Testing of air quality in more than 500 homes shows no detection of contaminants, DeWine said Friday. While 75 homes showed elevated levels of volatile organic compounds -- chemicals generally present in paint, flooring carpet and other similar items -- none were contaminants of concern from the derailment. DeWine explained volatile organic compounds are generally present in ""things we are in contact with every day,"" including furniture and cigarette smoke. ""So nothing from the train derailment was found in the homes. Nothing was found out on the street,"" DeWine said. More than two dozen additional homes are scheduled for air testing Friday. DeWine also said 20 air quality monitors are located throughout the community to monitor air. Regarding the safety of the water supply, DeWine said Friday on Fox News, ""The water we have tested comes back good. We are telling people that if you're on the city water, the village water, you can certainly drink that."" People with private wells should drink bottled water until their wells are tested and cleared, he said. He said a section of a creek near the crash site remains severely contaminated. ""We knew this. We know this,"" he said. ""It's going to take a while to remediate. ""It's certainly a place to be avoided at this point."" He noted shortly after the crash, the creek was dammed to help prevent contamination downstream. Officials have diverted the creek to allow clean water to bypass the area of the derailment. He said it has been ""a very, very traumatic, horrible experience"" for people, and he understands their concerns. A community health clinic will open next week ""out of an abundance of caution,"" DeWine said. ""We're going to bring in the best experts in the country. ""The railroad created this problem. The people didn't create this problem,"" DeWine added, saying about holding Norfolk Southern accountable for the derailment. ""We're going to hold their feet to the fire. We're going to stay on them. They're going to do it."" Testing of water from the Ohio River at various points downstream shows no high concentrations of chemicals, Jeff Swertfeger of the Greater Cincinnati Water Works told CNN on Friday morning. More than 5 million people in the state get drinking water from the river, he said. ""Fortunately we're not finding the high concentrations that they're seeing up in the East Palestine area,"" Swertfeger said. He added one compound, butyl acrylate, is ""decreasing a bit as it's coming down the river."" He noted the compound would not normally be detected in the river. Earlier, another train operated by Norfolk Southern derailed Thursday morning in Michigan's Van Buren Charter Township, and local officials said there was no evidence the area was exposed to hazardous materials. Where the investigation stands Federal transportation investigators are working vigorously to determine what caused the 100-car freight train to crash in Ohio, the head of the National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday in a thread of tweets. ""You have my personal commitment that the NTSB will CONTINUE to share all information publicly as soon as possible following our analysis,"" board chairwoman Jennifer Homendy wrote. ""Next: NTSB investigators will thoroughly examine the tank cars once decontaminated. As always, we'll issue urgent safety recommendations as needed."" One of the elements under scrutiny is an apparently overheated wheel bearing seen on video before the derailment, the NTSB has said. The apparent overheating began at least 43 minutes before the train derailed, according to a CNN analysis of surveillance videos the network obtained. At around 8:12 p.m. on February 3, sparks from an apparent wheel bearing overheating were visible as the train passed through Salem, Ohio, two surveillance videos obtained by CNN show. Bright light and sparks are seen emanating from one of the rail cars. No sparks were seen in surveillance video taken 14 minutes earlier as the train passed through Alliance, Ohio. The train derailed in East Palestine around 8:55 p.m., about 43 minutes after the sparks were seen in Salem. It remains unclear what caused the overheating and whether it is linked to the derailment. The train was carrying toxic materials including vinyl chloride, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, ethylhexyl acrylate, isobutylene and butyl acrylate, the US Environmental Protection Agency has said. Of those, the vinyl chloride gas that caught fire could break down into compounds including hydrogen chloride and phosgene, a chemical weapon used during World War I as a choking agent, according to the EPA and the CDC. Vinyl chloride -- a volatile organic compound, or VOC, and the most toxic chemical involved in the derailment -- is known to cause cancer, attacking the liver, and can also affect the brain, Maria Doa of the Environmental Defense Fund told CNN. Resident worries not everyone is receiving proper testing It's the dangers these chemicals pose putting East Palestine residents on edge over the past two weeks. In a town hall meeting Wednesday, East Palestine Mayor Trent Conaway addressed the February 6 controlled detonations, saying the only option was to release the chemicals manually or risk greater danger to residents. ""There (were) two options: We either detonate those tanks, or they detonate themselves,"" Conaway told a group of reporters at Wednesday's meeting. ""If we didn't do that, then they were going to blow up, and we were going to have shrapnel all across this town."" Jami Cozza, an East Palestine resident, said she will not return home until it's safe. Cozza told CNN she's staying at a hotel paid for by the train company due to toxicity in her home. Cozza explained the train company told her it was safe to return home after conducting air testing. She insisted the company run soil and water tests, and only then did a toxicologist deem her house unsafe. ""Had I not used my voice, had I not thrown a fit, I would be sitting in that house right now, when they told me that it was safe,"" Cozza said Thursday, adding she's worried not all residents are receiving the proper level of testing. Cozza noted the company has also offered to pay all of her moving expenses. ""It's not about the money. It's about our house,"" she said. Representatives of the train's operator, Norfolk Southern, did not attend the community meeting Wednesday, citing safety concerns after it said employees were threatened, further escalating tensions. Despite the company's absence, the mayor said the operator has been collaborating with local officials ""tremendously.""

Fact check: Biden's latest false statistical claims,2023-02-17,"President Joe Biden has made another series of inaccurate claims in an economic speech.  In late January, CNN fact-checked Biden's false and misleading claims in an economic speech to union workers in Virginia. In a speech this Wednesday to union workers in Maryland, Biden repeated one of those claims and made three other incorrect statements -- all of them about statistics. Trump and the national debt  In the Wednesday speech, Biden criticized the fiscal management of former President Donald Trump. After correctly noting that the federal budget deficit increased every year of Trump's term, Biden said, ""And because of those record deficits, no president added more to the national debt -- that's a 200-year debt -- never added more to the national debt than my predecessor."" Facts First: This claim is false. More debt was added in the eight years under President Barack Obama, with Biden as vice president, than in the four years under Trump. The Trump era set the record for most debt added in a single four-year presidential term, but Biden made it sound here like the Trump era set the record even when you include two-term presidents like Obama. (Biden correctly said in his State of the Union address last week that he was referring to a record for debt added in a four-year period.) Also, while Biden mentioned ""record deficits,"" plural, under Trump, only one Trump-era deficit, in pandemic-era fiscal 2020, was actually a record; the deficits in fiscal 2017, 2018 and 2019 were all lower than every deficit in Obama's first term, when the country was emerging from a major recession and Obama approved some policies that increased deficits. There are various ways to measure the debt. Using the basic headline measure, total public debt, the debt increased about $9.3 trillion over Obama's eight years, from about $10.6 trillion on the day he was inaugurated in 2009 to about $19.9 trillion on the day Trump took office in 2017. The debt increased by about $7.8 trillion over Trump's four years, to about $27.8 trillion when Biden replaced him in 2021.  It's also important to note that it is an oversimplification to blame presidents alone for debt incurred during their tenures.  A significant amount of spending under any president is the result of decisions made by their predecessors -- such as the creation of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid decades ago -- and by circumstances out of a president's control, such as an inherited recession for Obama and the global Covid-19 pandemic for Trump.  And while some debt can fairly be attributed to a single party -- Trump's 2017 tax cuts, unanimously opposed by congressional Democrats, were a significant contributor -- other debt is bipartisan. Notably, the debt spiked in 2020 after Trump approved trillions in emergency pandemic relief spending that Congress had passed with overwhelming Democratic and Republican support. Biden was right when he said that the deficit increased every year under Trump. But the deficits in fiscal 2017, 2018 and 2019 under Trump were all below $1 trillion -- lower than the deficits in fiscal 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 under the Obama-Biden administration. The deficit then roughly tripled, to a record level of about $3.1 trillion, in pandemic-era fiscal 2020. Biden and the national debt In another part of the speech, Biden said, ""We cut the debt by $1.7 billion the last two years."" The White House made a correction to the official transcript to make it ""$1.7 trillion"" instead of ""$1.7 billion."" Facts First: This claim is inaccurate even if you ignore Biden's billion-versus-trillion mixup. The national debt has continued to increase under Biden. It is the deficit that has declined by about $1.7 trillion -- and experts say it is misleading for Biden to take credit for that reduction. The debt has increased about $3.7 trillion during Biden's time as president, rising to about $31.5 trillion. As Biden also did in speeches during the 2022 midterms, his claim in this speech conflated the debt (the accumulation of federal borrowing plus interest owed) with the deficit (the one-year difference between spending and revenues).  The deficit did fall by roughly $1.7 trillion between fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2022, from about $3.1 trillion to about $1.4 trillion. But as CNN has repeatedly noted, it is highly questionable how much credit Biden deserves for the decline -- which overwhelmingly occurred because the emergency pandemic spending from the end of the Trump era expired as planned. In fact, independent analysts say Biden's own new laws and executive actions have significantly added to current and projected future deficits, not reduced those deficits. You can read more here and here. Medicare and the Inflation Reduction Act Biden made a confusing remark about prescription drug costs and the Inflation Reduction Act he signed into law last year.  He said the law ""saves seniors a lot of money"" on prescription drugs, then added that, by bringing down the cost of these drugs, the law ""will cut the federal deficit, saving taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars over time.""  Both of these assertions are fair. But then Biden added that if Republicans repealed this law, they would be getting rid of ""$159,000 a year in savings on lower drug costs."" Here's a fuller quote: ""Now, our Republican friends want to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act. They'd get rid of the savings on prescription drugs that we buy, like Medicare -- I mean, we buy from -- through -- through Medicare. And it would eliminate, today, right now, $159,000 a year in savings on lowered drug costs. Now, that just means your tax dollars are going to save -- be saved $159,000 to do what we're doing right now."" Facts First: The Inflation Reduction Act does not provide ""$159,000 a year in savings on lowered drug costs."" A White House official made clear to CNN on Thursday that Biden was attempting to say that government savings of $159 billion over 10 years would be lost with a Republican repeal of two key Inflation Reduction Act provisions on prescription drugs.  Viewed one way, Biden's ""$159,000 a year"" figure significantly understated the total savings from these two provisions. (One allows Medicare to negotiate the price of certain prescription drugs. The other requires pharmaceutical companies to pay rebates to Medicare for price increases over the rate of inflation.) But his use of such a modest number may have led some listeners to believe that he was talking about giant savings to particular seniors or families rather than modest savings to the government. And his figure was incorrect regardless of how it was perceived. The White House corrected this section of the official transcript of the speech after CNN inquired about the ""$159,000"" figure.  Billionaires and taxes  Biden reprised an inaccurate figure he used in the Virginia speech in late January. He said of billionaires in the United States: ""You know what their average tax they pay is? About 3%."" Facts First: Once more, Biden's ""3%"" claim is incorrect. For the third time in less than a month, Biden inaccurately described a 2021 finding from economists in his administration that the wealthiest 400 billionaire families paid an average of 8.2% of their income in federal individual income taxes between 2010 and 2018; after CNN inquired about Biden's ""3%"" claim in the late-January speech, the White House published a corrected transcript of that speech to make it ""8%"" instead. Also, it's important to note that even the 8% number is contested, since it is an alternative calculation that includes unrealized capital gains that are not treated as taxable income under federal law. ""Biden's numbers are way too low,"" Howard Gleckman, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute think tank, told CNN in late January -- though Gleckman also said we don't know precisely what tax rates billionaires do pay. Gleckman wrote in an email: ""In 2019, Berkeley economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabe Zucman estimated the top 400 households paid an average effective tax rate of about 23 percent in 2018. They got a lot of attention at the time because that rate was lower than the average rate of 24 percent for the bottom half of the income distribution. But it still was way more than 2 or 3, or even 8 percent."" Biden has cited the 8% statistic in various other speeches, but unlike the administration economists who came up with it, he tends not to explain that it doesn't describe tax rates in a conventional way. And regardless, he said ""3%"" in this speech and the Virginia speech -- and ""2%"" in another January speech.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",55,123.0,0.1469166666666667,0.766,0.08691666666666666,-0.2799749999999999,0.099,0.828,0.073,-0.9863,-15.398624999999996,184.6547375,575.0,0.3211386739130435
GOP operative gets 1.5 years in prison for facilitating illegal Russian donation to Trump 2016 campaign,2023-02-17,"A Republican strategist was sentenced Friday to 1.5 years in prison for facilitating an illegal contribution from a Russian businessman to Donald Trump's presidential campaign in 2016. Jessie Benton, who worked for the pro-Trump super PAC and was a longtime aide to former GOP Rep. Ron Paul, was convicted by a federal jury in November on several charges, including conspiring to solicit an illegal foreign campaign contribution. Both the Trump campaign and Trump himself were not aware of the scheme involving Russian money, the Justice Department has said.  According to evidence presented at trial, Benton helped a Russian national secure a ticket to a Republican National Committee event in 2016, where he would have the opportunity to meet and take a picture with Trump. The Russian national paid Benton $100,000 to get the ticket, prosecutors said. Benton created a fake invoice suggesting he had received the money for consulting services, donated $25,000 of that money under his own name to the RNC to get a ticket to the event and pocketed the remaining $75,000. A veteran GOP operative, Benton has now been convicted of crimes related to the 2016 and 2012 elections. He was previously convicted of falsifying federal records as part of a plot to buy an endorsement from an Iowa state senator, who flipped her support to Paul during the 2012 Republican primary. Trump pardoned Benton for those crimes in late 2020, wiping those convictions off the books.","{'neg': 0.33, 'neu': 0.67, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.7845}",8,124.0,0.046,0.8380000000000001,0.11599999999999999,0.139575,0.067,0.849,0.085,0.5574,1.1166,182.27343750000003,526.0,0.34652744771863125
"Fox News stars and executives privately trashed Trump's election fraud claims, court document reveals",2023-02-17,"The most prominent stars and highest-ranking executives at Fox News privately ridiculed claims of election fraud in the 2020 election, despite the right-wing channel allowing lies about the presidential contest to be promoted on its air, damning messages contained in a Thursday court filing revealed. The messages, included in a legal filing as part of Dominion Voting System's $1.6 billion lawsuit against Fox News, showed that Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, and Laura Ingraham brutally mocked lies being pushed by former President Donald Trump's camp asserting that the election was rigged. In one set of messages revealed in the court filing, Carlson texted Ingraham, saying that Sidney Powell, an attorney who was representing the Trump campaign, was ""lying"" and that he had ""caught her"" doing so. Ingraham responded, ""Sidney is a complete nut. No one will work with her. Ditto with Rudy [Giuliani]."" The messages also revealed that Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of Fox Corporation, did not believe Trump's election lies and even floated the idea of having Carlson, Hannity, and Ingraham appear together in prime time to declare Joe Biden as the rightful winner of the election. Such an act, Murdoch said, ""Would go a long way to stop the Trump myth that the election stolen."" The court document offered the most vivid picture to date of the chaos that transpired behind the scenes at Fox News after Trump lost the election and viewers rebelled against the right-wing channel for accurately calling the contest in Biden's favor. Dominion filed its mammoth lawsuit against Fox News in March 2021, alleging that during the 2020 presidential election the talk network ""recklessly disregarded the truth"" and pushed various pro-Donald Trump conspiracy theories about the election technology company because ""the lies were good for Fox's business."" Fox News has not only vigorously denied Dominion's claims, it has insisted it is ""proud"" of its 2020 election coverage. In a statement Thursday night, Fox News argued that the court filing contained cherry-picked quotes lacking context. ""There will be a lot of noise and confusion generated by Dominion and their opportunistic private equity owners, but the core of this case remains about freedom of the press and freedom of speech, which are fundamental rights afforded by the Constitution and protected by New York Times v. Sullivan,"" the network said. But the court document provided a mountain of evidence exposing Fox News as a right-wing talk channel void of the most basic journalistic ethics. The legal filing also underscored how worried Fox News executives and hosts were in the immediate aftermath of the election of losing its viewership to Newsmax, a smaller right-wing talk channel that was saturating its airwaves with election denialism. After the election, a furious Trump attacked Fox News and encouraged his followers to switch to Newsmax. And, in the days and weeks after the presidential contest had been called, they did just that. Fox News shed a chunk of its audience while Newsmax gained significant viewership. In multiple instances, Fox News executives and hosts expressed worry over the matter and started to crack down on those at the network who fact-checked election lies — even as the messages show that Fox News' chief political anchor, Bret Baier, pushed for such fact checks. In one case, after White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich fact-checked a Trump tweet pushing election fraud, Carlson said he wanted her fired. ""Please get her fired,"" Carlson told Hannity over text message. ""Seriously ... what the f**k? I'm actually shocked ... It needs to stop immediately, like tonight. It's measurably hurting the company."" Hannity replied that he had already spoken to Suzanne Scott, the network's chief executive. The next morning, Heinrich's tweet had been deleted. A person with direct knowledge of the matter told CNN that Heinrich was blindsided reading the details in the legal filing and was not aware of the efforts by top hosts behind the scenes to get her fired. In another case, when host Neil Cavuto cut away from a White House press briefing where election misinformation was being promoted, senior Fox News leadership were told such a move presented a ""brand threat."" Scott exchanged messages with Lachlan Murdoch, the Fox Corporation chief executive, and outlined a plan to win viewers back. Scott said the right-wing talk channel would ""highlight our stars and plant flags letting the viewers know we hear them and respect them."" Murdoch responded that the brand needed ""rebuilding without any missteps."" Soon after, Fox News debuted a new ""standing up for what's right"" marketing campaign featuring the network's top stars. Despite what appeared on air, Fox News executives and hosts privately criticized the Trump camp for pushing claims of election fraud, the messages showed. Hannity even said Giuliani was ""acting like an insane person"" and Ingraham described him as ""an idiot."" Rupert Murdoch said it was ""really bad"" that Giuliani was advising Trump.

"Biden administration restores Obama-era mercury rules for power plants, eyes more regulations in coming months",2023-02-17,"The Biden administration on Friday finalized a decision to reestablish Obama-era rules that require coal and oil-fired power plants to reduce toxic pollutants, including mercury and acid gas, that come out of their smokestacks.  Mercury is a neurotoxin with several health impacts, including harmful effects on children's brain development. And while the updated rule significantly benefits public health for communities around these kinds of power plants, it also has the effect of requiring plants to cut down on planet-warming pollution that comes from burning coal to generate electricity.  President Joe Biden's Environmental Protection Agency announced early last year that it intended to undo a Trump-era rollback of the 2012 mercury pollution rules, one of many Trump-era environmental decisions it has reversed. ""This is a really good day for public health in this country,"" EPA Deputy Administrator Janet McCabe told CNN. ""We're talking about mercury, arsenic, acid gases; these are dangerous pollutants that impact people's health.""  The EPA estimates the 2012 rule brought down mercury emissions from power plants by 86% by 2017, while acid gas emissions were reduced by 96%. McCabe said the EPA is currently working on its own, stronger mercury standard that it expects to propose ""not too long from now"" and finalize before the end of Biden's first term.  The Mercury and Air Toxics Standards rules are part of a larger tranche of regulations the agency is expected to roll out this spring that would cut down on coal-fired power plant pollution, including rules on proper disposal of coal ash.  It also plans to release a much-anticipated rule that would regulate planet-warming pollution like carbon dioxide and methane. That rule is expected to be more limited than climate advocates desire, after the US Supreme Court limited the EPA's ability to broadly regulate carbon pollution in a ruling last year.  ""We're very mindful of the Supreme Court precedent,"" McCabe told CNN. ""We've been working very, very carefully to craft a rule that will be in the four corners of the direction that the Supreme Court has laid down.""  McCabe said the agency will propose that rule ""in the relatively near future,"" but did not share specifics about what the rule would do to limit pollution. Many of the nation's coal-fired power plants are aging and new ones are not being built -- especially as it's getting more expensive operate existing plans. If the EPA implements stronger federal regulations on mercury, coal ash and greenhouse gas emissions, it could have the impact of more utilities shuttering coal-fired plants, as many are already doing.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.864, 'pos': 0.136, 'compound': 0.296}",16,126.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.025,0.923,0.053,0.8781,0.0,-35.573002777777745,206.0,-0.17268447950377547
Key senators torn over retirement decisions as party leaders try to fortify 2024 standing,2023-02-17,"Sen. Joe Manchin, torn over whether to run for reelection, says he's ""given everything I possibly can"" over four decades of holding public office. Sen. Jon Tester is close to making his final decision on a 2024 bid and concedes there's a risk of his seat flipping next year.  ""It's a commitment,"" the Montana Democrat said of another run.  They're not the only ones in a tough spot.   Sen. Bob Casey, a Pennsylvania Democrat, is weighing health considerations after treatment for prostate cancer. Sen. Bernie Sanders, 81, says he'll make a decision about whether to run for a fourth Senate term in Vermont ""at the appropriate time.""  And Sen. Mitt Romney, a Utah Republican who has gone to battle with former President Donald Trump, says he'll decide whether to run for a second term by mid-April, sounding ready to take on his party's MAGA wing if he runs again.  ""People understand that every action has a consequence, and you accept the consequences for the actions that you think are right,"" Romney, 75, said of potentially facing a stiff challenge from the right. He then added bullishly: ""If I run, I'll win."" As the 2024 landscape begins to take shape, the senators' decisions about their political futures will dramatically alter the map and hold major ramifications for the makeup of the institution itself.   For Democrats, the concern is the most acute. They already have a difficult road to maintain their slim 51-49 majority, with 23 seats to defend compared to just 11 for the GOP.   Plus they'll have to hold onto Democratic seats in GOP terrain, such as in Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia -- not to mention keep their seats in swing states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan and Nevada. The map provides them with scant pickup opportunities, since Republican incumbents are mostly running in ruby-red states or states that have trended to the GOP, like Florida.   Then there's the complicated dance for both parties in Arizona, if Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, now an independent, decides to run again for a seat that would put her up against a Republican and Democrat in a messy, three-way race. For Republicans, fear is growing that the hard-right Kari Lake may mount a bid and put their hopes for a pickup in jeopardy. And with few pickup chances, Senate Democrats recognize they'll have to limit losses -- and prevent retirements -- in order to cling to power.  ""I'm doing everything I can to help Manchin in West Virginia,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told CNN when asked if he were concerned that the conservative Democrat might hang it up, referring to legislative actions.  After Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow announced she'd retire, Schumer and his top deputies are hoping to prevent others from following suit, recognizing that an open seat would give Republicans an even better chance of seizing control of the chamber they lost in the 2020 elections. The exception is California, where the 89-year-old Dianne Feinstein announced her retirement this week, something widely expected, as Democrats are expected to keep the seat in their control in the blue state. In particular, Democratic leaders are urging Tester and Manchin to run again, knowing full well that finding another Democrat to win in those conservative battlegrounds will be an extremely tall order in 2024.  ""Clearly, it's important for them to run,"" said Sen. Gary Peters, a Michigan Democrat who chairs the Senate Democratic campaign arm, when asked about Tester and Manchin. ""I don't know where they are. I've talked to them, but they're just working through issues, personal issues for themselves as to what they want to do. So we just have to give them time to think that through and I look forward to their answers.""  Peters acknowledged that his party's effort to keep the Senate will grow bleaker if either or both men retire.  ""Those are states that are very Republican,"" Peters told CNN, referring to Montana and West Virginia. ""And I know they can win again, but they're without question the strongest candidates in those states. It'd be more difficult without them running.""  What Manchin and Tester are considering  Democrats acknowledge they have close to no backup plans in Montana or West Virginia. But they have been heartened by the polls that are being released publicly by Republican groups in those states, showing their numbers have been better than expected -- and perhaps encouraging -- for the incumbents. But neither Manchin nor Tester seem concerned that the seat could turn red if they retire. ""That's not my factor,"" Manchin said in the interview. ""I'm not weighing that because of my, what it might do to the numbers as far as up here. No, I've been at this for quite some time. This term being up, there'll be 42 years I've been in public service so I've given everything I possibly can."" Several Democratic operatives involved in planning for Senate races tell CNN they expect that ultimately, Tester will run and that Casey will as well after his successful surgery this week. Manchin has them more on edge, and they anticipate that's how they'll remain for almost a year: the West Virginia filing deadline isn't until next January. That, after all, is what he did in 2018. Manchin, a former governor and state legislator who has served in the Senate since 2010, insists he's not concerned about the prospects that the GOP governor, Jim Justice, is strongly considering a run against him, though Justice would have to escape a difficult primary against Rep. Alex Mooney and potentially the state's attorney general, Patrick Morrisey, who may run as well. He has acknowledged that Justice would be the toughest candidate to face, though he insists he could still pull off a victory. Manchin, 75, just doesn't know if he wants to do it again as he looks back at the last several years -- especially in the 50-50 Senate in the last Congress where he was at the peak of his power in the chamber and played a central role shaping major laws. The question Manchin is weighing: whether he'll have the same kind of impact with another six years. ""I make a decision based on if I've been able to deliver for the state, have I been able to support the Constitution and the oath I've taken, I think I have,"" Manchin said, confirming he's been urged by Biden and Schumer both to run. ""Is there more I can do in different, other areas? I don't know."" Tester, who also said Schumer has been urging him to run, conceded that his seat could flip if he bows out. ""Oh, absolutely there's a risk of flipping there's no doubt about that but so are all of them,"" Tester said. But he contended other Democrats could mount a vigorous challenge for the seat. ""Actually, we've got some really good folks in the wings that can run,"" Tester, 66, said before he noted that things have gotten dire for Democrats in recent cycles. ""We haven't had the best of luck the last few cycles in Montana but I think that's as much self-inflicted as it is the state turning red."" But Tester pointed to key positions he holds -- chairing a subcommittee on Pentagon spending and running the veterans panel -- as he weighs another run. ""I'm at a point and time where we can get a lot of good things done because of my position on Veterans Affairs and defense chairman but it's just something where I think you just need to take the time to think over,"" he said. Yet Democrats could benefit from a potentially divisive GOP primary in Montana -- with the possibility of candidacies from two House members, the governor and the state attorney general. That will put the other Montana senator, Republican Steve Daines, to the test as he plans to use his National Republican Senatorial Committee to be more assertive in GOP primaries to root out lackluster general election candidates, though it's unclear how he would handle his home state. In an interview, Daines was noncommittal when asked about one candidate in particular -- Rep. Matt Rosendale -- a hard-right Republican who lost to Tester in 2018 and is considering running again. He said ""it's early"" since candidates have yet to declare and that the field will get ""sorted out,"" contending the race is ""winnable."" ""These are three red states where the only statewide elected official left that's a Democrat is a US Senator. That's Montana, it's West Virginia, it's Ohio,"" Daines said. ""These are going to be spirited races."" And after last cycle's GOP debacle, where several Donald Trump-aligned candidates petered out in the general election and effectively cost them winning the majority, Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell is determined not to allow that to happen again. ""I just think we need to focus on candidates who can win in the general election,"" said Sen. John Cornyn, a Republican from Texas and close McConnell ally. ""We had some great primary candidates, but that won't get the job done. You got to have somebody who can have a broader appeal than just the base. That was one of the most important lessons of this last cycle.""  Arizona draws concerns from both parties Senate leaders in both parties see Arizona as the biggest wildcard -- depending on what Sinema decides to do and which Republican decides to run.  Lake, the Trump-aligned Republican who lost one of the nation's premier governor's races last fall, recently met with officials at NRSC headquarters -- even though many Republicans are nervous about her potential candidacy and one GOP strategist called the potential of a Lake Senate run ""disastrous."" As she made the rounds in Washington, Daines told CNN that he spoke with Lake. ""I want to see a candidate who can not only win a primary, but can win a general election,"" Daines said when asked about that visit, not commenting on Lake directly. Other top Republicans are unnerved about Lake -- and her evidence-free claims of widespread election fraud -- and are pushing for other candidates to jump into the race. ""I've just said to any of our candidates or potential candidates in 2024, that you got to talk about the future, not the past,"" said Senate Minority Whip John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 2 Republican. ""And I think if you're building your campaign around the theme of a stolen election, that's not a winning strategy. We've seen that. So if she does decide to do it again, I think she's gonna have to talk about the things that are on the hearts and minds of American people."" Schumer and Democratic leaders, themselves, are in a bind in the state, refusing to say if they'll back their party's nominee with Sinema still undecided on a run. The reason: They need Sinema to continue to organize with them in order to maintain their 51-49 majority and are in no mood to alienate her.  But some Democrats are angry at their leaders for refusing to say if they'll back their nominee, especially backers of Rep. Ruben Gallego, the party's leading candidate in the race.

Trump wants to block past accusers from testifying at E. Jean Carroll defamation trial,2023-02-17,"Former President Donald Trump is seeking to block two women who previously accused him of sexual assault from being called to testify at a separate defamation trial this spring. E. Jean Carroll, the former magazine columnist who sued Trump for defamation after he denied raping her in the mid-1990s, has indicated that she will call Natasha Stoynoff and Jessica Leeds, two women who came forward with allegations against Trump in 2016, as well as use their videotaped depositions. The trial, which is scheduled to start on April 25, is expected to last between five and seven days. Stoynoff alleged Trump sexually assaulted her when she was reporting an article about Trump and his wife Melania for People Magazine. Leeds alleged Trump groped her while they were on an airplane together. Trump has denied both allegations, as well as Carroll's rape claims. In a motion to exclude their testimony, Trump's lawyers told the judge that, ""recounting these alleged encounters will offer no relevant or meaningful insight into the central question"" of whether Carroll was raped in the mid-1990s. Trump's lawyers also asked the judge to block the Access Hollywood tape from being played at the trial. The tape, where Trump was caught on camera bragging about groping women, is ""irrelevant and highly prejudicial,"" Trump's lawyers argued. Carroll's lawyers say the testimony and the Access Hollywood video are relevant. ""Here, the testimony establishes a modus operandi: Trump's pattern of suddenly and without warning lunging at a woman, pushing his body against her, grabbing at her, and kissing her, in what constitutes a knowing and intentional sexual assault, and later categorically denying the allegations and declaring that the accuser was too ugly for him to have sexually assaulted her,"" Carroll's attorneys write. Carroll's lawyers want to block Trump's lawyers from asking questions about DNA during the trial. Carroll initially sought to obtain a cheek swab of Trump's DNA but gave up those efforts. Trump had refused to provide his DNA until recently when he said he would provide a sample of his DNA if he was given the appendix of a DNA report produced years ago. The judge called that a ""quid pro quo"" and denied Trump's request saying the window had closed. The case is set to go to trial in April while awaiting a DC appeals court decision that could determine whether the case proceeds against Trump. Carroll also sued Trump for battery and defamation in a separate lawsuit under a new New York law. The judge has not determined whether the trials will be combined.","{'neg': 0.182, 'neu': 0.818, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.4404}",18,128.0,0.1416666666666667,0.8263333333333335,0.03206666666666667,-0.5224916666666667,0.111,0.863,0.026,-0.9859,-9.40485,-23.336627777777753,158.0,-0.14770017580871997
Palestinian activist beaten by Israeli soldier tells CNN he is scared for his life,2023-02-17,"Palestinian activist Issa Amro, who was filmed being assaulted by an Israeli solder on Monday, told CNN he is physically and psychologically affected by the attack and fears for his life. ""I am injured. I have pain in both my arms, my back and my leg and I am psychologically affected from this attack and from the consequences of the attack -- [National Security Minister Itamar] Ben Gvir supporting the soldier, the army lying about what happened,"" he told CNN's Lynda Kinkade on Connect the World. ""Now I am afraid about my life and I'm afraid about the life of the people who are still living in the same area from any kind of revenge from the Israeli soldiers,"" he added. Lawrence Wright, a writer for the New Yorker magazine who was with Amro at the time, posted video of the assault on Twitter. It showed two IDF soldiers manhandling the well-known activist, throwing him onto the ground, and one soldier kicking him, before that soldier is pushed away by other troops.  In response to CNN's interview with Amro, Israel Defense Forces international spokesman Lt. Col. Richard Hecht said there was ""no justification"" for the soldier's behavior, but suggested Amro had provoked the incident. ""There was no justification whatsoever for the soldier's behavior. It was handled swiftly and aggressively by Gen. Yehuda Fuchs, the Central Command general.  ""But I know Issa Amro from my time as a battalion commander -- and again, I am saying there is no justification for it -- but he is a provocateur. He provokes soldiers all the time, looking for a young 19-year-old solider to make that kind of mistake, and sadly it happened. And we took care of it,"" Hecht said. Hecht said he had tried to contact Amro to discuss the incident, and shared a screenshot of a message to the activist dated Monday. ""We reached out with him to try to dialogue with him, me personally, like we did with Lawrence Wright, who met us. And we said what we needed to say,"" Hecht said. The Israeli soldier who was filmed assaulting Amro in Hebron was sentenced to 10 days in military jail. Journalist rejects IDF version of events  In a statement on Monday the IDF said the soldier had ""asked a Palestinian who approached"" a military post to ""step away."" ""In response, the Palestinian began recording and cursing the soldier. A verbal confrontation followed, which soon became a physical confrontation, during which the soldier hit the Palestinian,"" the IDF statement said. But Wright rejected that version of events, saying ""the soldier initiated the encounter"" and that Amro ""did not curse or interfere only asked that he call the commander."" He posted video of Amro making that request.  Amro repeated this account to CNN. He said it was a ""typical day"" in Hebron for him: showing a journalist or an international visitor around the different neighborhoods, especially where Israeli military is present and enforcing the military system. He said one of the soldiers didn't like that, and made the photographer accompanying Wright delete the footage he took around Hebron. Amro then filmed that encounter, which he said upset the soldiers. ""The Israeli military in Hebron, they try to hide the truth, they try to hide what's going on... So the soldier first detained me, threatened me, then he beat me up and threw me to the ground and hit me again and threatened me again, and then the army lied despite that everything was on video,"" he said. The Palestinian activist said he asked to speak to the soldier's commander, because he knew he was legally allowed to walk in his ""own streets"" and film with his camera. The US Office of Palestinian Affairs said on Twitter: ""We condemn aggression towards civil society & the attack on Issa Amro. We note the IDF has said it disciplined the soldier involved. Authorities must exercise restraint towards civilians in the West Bank, not resort to disproportionate violence anywhere, including at checkpoints."" Asked to comment on that statement, Amro told CNN he thanks the Office of Palestinian Affairs, but says he wants the Biden administration to reopen the Palestinian consulate in East Jerusalem and reverse the Trump administration's policies. He said, ""unfortunately what happened to me is happening almost every day,"" adding that he filed many complaints to the Israeli police about soldier and settler violence, but saying he had gotten no accountability. ""I want this kind of violence to stop. I want the American State Department and American administration to really put high pressure and make the occupation and apartheid costly for the Israeli government,"" he continued.  ""It's a military system, it's not only about individual soldiers...I want the American administration to target the military system.""","{'neg': 0.322, 'neu': 0.678, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.6908}",35,129.0,0.0,0.949,0.051,0.2382,0.151,0.804,0.045,-0.9982,8.337,-16.116227777777755,185.0,-0.08711474474474462
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's fate is again in the hands of the Supreme Court,2023-02-17,"The Supreme Court may decide as soon as Friday whether to tackle a new case that could further constrain the power of US regulators to delve into American businesses and individual lives.  In recent rulings, this conservative-dominated high court has been diminishing regulatory control for consumer protection, public health and the environment. The justices' opinions have revealed major separation-of-powers concerns, along with a particular disdain for the countless pages of rules government imposes and a disregard for agency expertise, whether involving health services, workplace safety or consumer affairs.  The new case picks up from a battle three years ago involving the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, when opponents targeted the agency's structure and tried to dismantle its authority to safeguard mortgages, car loans, credit cards and other lending practices.  By a narrow vote, the justices struck down the CFPB's single-director setup but allowed it to otherwise continue operating. Now, the agency is back before the high court, under scrutiny for its funding, which Congress established outside the usual appropriations process to ensure the bureau's independence.  The court majority in 2020 signaled an openness to the new grounds now asserted to topple the CFPB. What's more, Chief Justice John Roberts fixated on the issue during oral arguments in the previous case and may have been planting seeds for where the court is today.  ""Does the independence of the agency from the budgetary process further weaken the democratic accountability through the president,"" he asked at one point during the oral arguments in March 2020. He later added: ""they don't even have to go to Congress to get their money.""  This line of argument against the CFPB is based on novel, largely unexplored grounds that, if adopted, would undermine a range of independent government entities including the Federal Reserve Board and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.  The nine justices are scheduled to vote in a private session on Friday whether to take up the Biden administration's appeal of a ruling that invalidated the CFPB funding mechanism and threatens its entire mission.  The court's decision on whether to slate the case for oral arguments this spring will be the first step in determining the fate of an agency established in 2010 after the collapse of the housing market amid shady loan practices.  Roberts' role to efforts to limit federal agency powers  Roberts has shepherded many of the anti-regulatory decisions, for example, writing a 2022 ruling that limited the Environmental Protection Agency's ability to restrict carbon emissions from power plants.  When he authored the 2020 5-4 CFPB decision striking down the director set-up shielded from presidential removal, he suggested that its funding scheme -- which was not tested in the case -- could exacerbate constitutional concerns.  ""The CFPB's receipt of funds outside the appropriations process further aggravates the agency's threat to Presidential control,"" Roberts wrote in the 2020 case of Seila Law v. CFPB. ""The President normally has the opportunity to recommend or veto spending bills that affect the operation of administrative agencies.""  He added that such ""financial freedom"" could make the bureau more likely to ""slip from the Executive's control, and thus from that of the people.""  That one-paragraph reference in a 37-page opinion falls short of any certain endorsement of the argument, and since then only the New Orleans-based 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals, known for pushing legal boundaries, has declared that Congress breached the Constitution ""appropriations clause"" by sidestepping the usual appropriations process and enacting a law separately authorizing agency spending.  US Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, in a letter to the high court soon after the 5th Circuit ruled, emphasized the urgency of a resolution on the validity of the CFPB funding and asked the justices to make the case, CFPB v. Community Financial Services Association of America, a late addition to the current 2022-23 annual session. Rulings on cases this term are expected by the end of June.  Prelogar said the ""sweeping holdings"" of the 5th Circuit against the agency's independent-funding arrangement, ""threaten the validity of virtually every action the CFPB has taken in the 12 years since it was created -- as well as its ongoing activities.""  The specific dispute, arising from CFPB authority over ""payday"" lenders, has already been joined by familiar players in the war over regulatory power: Noel Francisco, who was the US solicitor general during the Trump administration, is representing the lending associations that have challenged the CFPB. (The Trump administration declined to defend the bureau in 2020.)  Perpetuating the usual political divide, an array of Democratic-run states, led by New York, is siding with the Biden administration position in favor of the CFPB, and Republican-run states, led by West Virginia, are backing the agency's challengers.  The latter red-state group implored the justices in a ""friend of the court"" brief to accept the case and stop this ""era of expansive executive power."" They call the CFPB ""a failed experiment in administrative governance.""  Countering that sentiment, the blue states accentuate the bureau's work for consumers as a ""valued enforcement and regulatory partner to the States."" They cite the joint federal-state action against Nationstar Mortgage for deceptive practices relating to servicing mortgages: ""That action resulted in almost $75 million in relief to more than 40,000 borrowers.""  Created after 2008 meltdown      Congress established the CFPB to oversee various federal laws against unfair, deceptive or abusive lending practices after the 2008 financial meltdown. Rather than finance the bureau with regular congressional appropriations, Congress dictated that its funding come directly from the Federal Reserve, which derives its money from bank assessments.  The specific CFPB rule in the new case limits a lender's ability to obtain loan repayment through preauthorized account access. It prohibits attempts to withdraw payments from accounts after two consecutive attempts have failed due to insufficient funds. (Excessive withdrawal attempts can subject borrowers to extra banking fees.)  A US district court upheld the regulation and spurned various claims that the CFPB was unconstitutional, including that the bureau's funding mechanism impinged the Constitution's appropriations clause. The district court judge noted that the appropriations clause bars money from being paid out of the Treasury unless it has been appropriated by an act of Congress but said that a statute authorizing an agency to receive certain funding meets that demand.  The 5th Circuit reversed, declaring that the Constitution gives Congress ""exclusive power over the federal purse"" and Congress cannot cede that power to other entities, such as the Federal Reserve.  ""The Appropriations Clause ... does more than reinforce Congress's power over fiscal matters,"" the appellate panel  wrote in October, ""(I)t affirmatively obligates Congress to use that authority to maintain the boundaries between the branches and preserve individual liberty from the encroachments of executive power.""  Noting that the CFPB receives funding from the Federal Reserve, which is itself outside the appropriations process, the three-judge appellate panel added, ""Congress did not merely cede direct control over the Bureau's budget by insulating it from annual or other time limited appropriations. It also ceded indirect control by providing that the Bureau's self-determined funding be drawn from a source that is itself outside the appropriations process -- a double insulation from Congress's purse strings that is 'unprecedented' across the government.""  The 5th Circuit panel drew heavily from an earlier 2022 opinion by the 5th Circuit's Judge Edith Jones, a long-serving bulwark of conservatism. Jones, a 1985 appointee of President Ronald Reagan, grounded her opinion on her originalist understanding on the Constitution, which she said ensured an institutional check on government spending.  Prelogar told the Supreme Court that the 5th Circuit interpretation is ""an unprecedented and erroneous understanding.""  ""Congress enacted a statute explicitly authorizing the CFPB to use a specified amount of funds from a specified source for specified purposes,"" Prelogar wrote in a court filing. ""The Appropriations Clause requires nothing more. The court of appeals' novel and ill-defined limits on Congress's spending authority contradict the Constitution's text, historical practice, and this Court's precedent.""  Representing the lender associations, Francisco said the 5th Circuit was correct in its constitutional interpretation. He is urging the justices to stay out of the dispute but says if it takes up the case, it should also review sections of the 5th Circuit decision that the lenders lost, specifically relating to the validity of the rule, which, he wrote, targets conduct that would fall outside ""the statutory definition of unfair or abusive conduct.""  In the Supreme Court's earlier CFPB case, Roberts' aside regarding the appropriations clause highlighted a president's ability to use ""budgetary tools"" to influence an agency's policies.  The reference did not escape Justice Elena Kagan, who wrote for the four dissenters in 2020 and she addressed Roberts' point herself, in a footnote.  She observed that Roberts had expressed concern that the CFBP obtains funding outside the normal appropriations process.  ""But so too do other financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC,"" she wrote. ""And budgetary independence comes mostly at the expense of Congress's control over the agency, not the President's.""  That, she added, implicitly brushing aside implicit separation-of-powers issues, ""actually works to the President's advantage.""

Georgia grand jury stokes new intrigue over Trump's legal exposure,2023-02-17,"The latest significant developments out of a special grand jury in Georgia probing Donald Trump's election-stealing effort in the state are ramping up intrigue over a question the entire political world wants answered: Will the ex-president be indicted? An excerpt of the special grand jury's report released Thursday showed that it recommended the district attorney seek indictments of one or more unnamed witnesses that it believed lied during testimony. Details on whether anyone should face charges on the underlying question -- an alleged attempt to overturn Joe Biden's election win -- were not released. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis had previously told a judge that charging decisions were ""imminent"" in the case. It is not clear whether any indictments for perjury or anything else would involve Trump or those close to him. The ex-president did not testify before the special grand jury. And Trump maintains he did nothing wrong. Thursday's developments are likely to lead to nervous moments for some of the 75 witnesses who testified to the investigation. The tantalizing glimpse into a few of the grand jury's conclusions also left outsiders considering whether the potential exposure of Trump and those around him had worsened in light of the new information. Also up in the air is how it would weigh on the mind of Willis as she considers decisions that could have a huge impact given the involvement of a former president who is an already declared candidate in the 2024 White House race. The new developments in Georgia added another sobering dimension to an already grave set of criminal investigations surrounding Trump. There are signs that a special counsel probe into his actions before and during the January 6 insurrection in 2021 and his hoarding of classified documents is picking up considerable pace under special counsel Jack Smith. Last week for instance, it emerged that Smith had taken the extraordinary step of subpoenaing the testimony of a former vice president in relation to the January 6 case. Mike Pence has vowed to contest the subpoena all the way to the Supreme Court. Legal expert is 'convinced' there may be indictments  Questions about Georgia are complicated by the fact that Thursday's excerpts came from a grand jury report that was only partially released. Such a document is, by definition, one-sided since witnesses do not testify alongside counsel or have a chance to rebut any accusations. The rest of the report was not released to avoid prejudicing the rights of people who may or may not end up being charged in the case. Still, the recommendations of perjury prosecutions, although non-binding, represent a small step forward on the issue of whether there will criminal accountability for an attempt to subvert democracy -- or to cover it up.  The grand jury heard from notable figures including Trump's lawyer, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, and former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Trump ally, told CNN's Manu Raju on Thursday that he had confidence in his testimony. Some legal analysts have concluded that the atmospherics of the case and the signals being sent by Willis mean that some indictments are likely -- though of course charges do not mean that someone will be convicted at trial. ""I am convinced there will be indictments, either for perjury or for other crimes,"" Thomas Dupree, a former deputy assistant attorney general in ex-President George W. Bush's administration, told CNN's Jake Tapper on Thursday. And CNN legal analyst Elie Honig pointed out the frank comments written by the grand jury on the potential question of perjury. ""The grand jury believes they witnessed serious wrongdoing. That is the tone. It's unmistakable in the report,"" Honig said. Significant comments on the lack of election fraud   One of the potentially most significant excerpts of the report deals with the grand jury's unanimous conclusion that there was no evidence of voter fraud in Georgia that could have altered the result of an election won by Biden by just under 12,000 votes.  ""The Grand Jury heard extensive testimony on the subject of alleged election fraud from poll workers, investigators, technical experts, and State of Georgia employees and officials, as well as from persons still claiming that such fraud took place,"" the special grand jury wrote in its report. Norm Eisen, a former diplomat and legal and ethics expert, told CNN on Thursday that the conclusion was a possibly important building block in any case against Trump. The finding ""goes right to the core of what Donald Trump has been claiming happened in Georgia. It repudiates him,"" Eisen said on CNN ""Newsroom"" ""It also establishes a basis for bringing charges -- you couldn't bring charges without this kind of a conclusion -- on solicitation of election fraud. This is another nail in the coffin that was already full of them."" RELATED: Fox News stars and executives privately trashed Trump's election fraud claims, court document reveals One potential defense if Trump is charged is that the ex-president fully believed there was election fraud in Georgia and elsewhere, and that he was seeking to protect the integrity of an election. Still, an election audit in Georgia that confirmed Biden's win and the actions of Republican election officials who also said there was insufficient fraud to overturn the result contribute to considerable reasonable doubt that Trump can genuinely have believed he won. The conclusions of the special grand jury further cement that impression. Still, Alberto Gonzales, who served as attorney general in the Bush administration, cautioned that it would be wrong to get ""terribly excited"" by Thursday's events in Georgia or to over-interpret them. ""We still have a ways to go to have a fuller picture of what the situation looks like in the mind of the prosecutors here,"" Gonzales said. Trump insisted in a statement that nothing that was revealed on Thursday had any bearing on his situation. ""The president participated in two perfect phone calls regarding election integrity in Georgia, which he is entitled to do -- in fact, as president, it was President Trump's Constitutional duty to ensure election safety, security, and integrity,"" the ex-president said in his statement. Trump's call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger was far from perfect, of course, as he pressured the Republican official to change the vote counts for the election to allow him to overtake Biden in the key swing state. ""All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state,"" Trump said, according to a transcript of the call that took place on January 2, 2021.  A Brookings Institution report into the Fulton County criminal investigation cites Georgia law in relation to election fraud, which says a felony has been committed if someone ""solicits, requests, commands, importunes, or otherwise attempts to cause the other person to engage in such conduct."" The report's authors consider that evidence suggests that Trump committed such acts several times between Election Day, 2020 and January 6, 2021, when Congress' certification of the election was temporarily delayed by the Capitol insurrection. Whether Willis concludes the same thing and if there is evidence sufficient to make indictments or to win a such a critical case is not yet clear. But the answer may be coming soon.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.64, 'pos': 0.36, 'compound': 0.5423}",45,131.0,0.07681249999999999,0.8108125,0.1124375,0.09712857142857145,0.061,0.853,0.087,0.9553,4.370785714285716,-31.354564285714254,229.0,-0.13691949469744216
Arizona Court of Appeals rejects Kari Lake's election challenge,2023-02-17,"The Arizona Court of Appeals has rejected Kari Lake's challenge to the result of the Arizona gubernatorial election after she appealed an earlier ruling from the superior court. Lake had requested a declaration from the court that she -- and not her opponent, Arizona's Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs who won the election by about 17,000 votes -- was the actual winner of the election. ""Her request for relief fails because the evidence presented to the superior court ultimately supports the court's conclusion that voters were able to cast their ballots, that votes were counted correctly, and that no other basis justifies setting aside the election results,"" the Court of Appeals decision stated. The appeal rejection marks the latest defeat for Lake, who has continually doubled down on her support for former President Donald Trump and false claims that he 2020 election was stolen, a central rallying call in her 2022 gubernatorial bid. Maricopa County Board of Supervisors Chairman Clint Hickman, a Republican, praised the Arizona Court of Appeals' rejection of Lake's claims. ""As we have said, every valid vote was counted in a midterm election that saw near-record turnout,"" Hickman said in a statement Thursday, adding: ""It's way past time to move on."" Lake's legal team broadly criticized Maricopa County's management of the election during the superior court trial. With the appeal, Lake sought to reverse Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Peter Thompson's conclusion that her team could not prove that someone intentionally caused Maricopa County's ballot-on-demand printers to malfunction, which Lake falsely claimed was part of a deliberate effort to rig the vote against her. In a tweet Thursday night, Lake said, ""We are NOT finished,"" adding that she was planning to take the case to the Arizona Supreme Court. ""Buckle up America,"" she said.","{'neg': 0.278, 'neu': 0.609, 'pos': 0.113, 'compound': -0.4404}",11,132.0,0.205,0.738,0.057,-0.7906,0.077,0.804,0.119,0.9313,-8.6966,-46.29376428571426,162.0,-0.28576397707231027
Newt Gingrich won't have to testify before special grand jury in Georgia,2023-02-17,"A battle to compel former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich to testify before a special grand jury in Georgia has come to an end after the case was dismissed Thursday. Gingrich had been ordered to appear before the grand jury and was in the midst of appealing that decision when the grand jury concluded its work in January. Both Gingrich's legal team and the Fulton County district attorney's office asked the appeals court to dismiss the case. ""The parties and the Office of the District Attorney for Fulton County, Georgia, agree that the order dissolving the Special Purpose Grand Jury 'moots the request' for Gingrich's testimony,"" according to an order from the appeals court. Prosecutors in Georgia had hoped to ask Gingrich about his work with the Trump campaign after the 2020 election, including the scheme to send fake elector certificates to the National Archives and allegedly encouraging the campaign ""to air advertisements promoting the false narrative that election workers had smuggled suitcases containing fake ballots at the State Farm Arena in Atlanta,"" according to court filings. Georgia prosecutors have been investigating efforts by former President Donald Trump and his associates to overturn the 2020 election there. No one has been charged in the case so far. Portions of the highly anticipated report from the special grand jury were released Thursday. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney ordered the limited release earlier this week, writing in his order that the report's introduction and conclusion, as well as concerns the grand jury panel had about witnesses lying under oath, will be made public.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.637, 'pos': 0.363, 'compound': 0.6908}",9,133.0,0.0585,0.884,0.0575,-0.0516,0.068,0.778,0.155,0.9758,-0.4644,-37.353314285714255,153.0,-0.2441393090569559
Opinion: The most remarkable thing about the Georgia grand jury report on Trump's election lie,2023-02-17,"It's time for former President Donald Trump and his associates to face the consequences of creating and perpetuating the lie that the 2020 election was stolen. And it's time for his supporters to re-enter the reality-based community and see the truth.  The findings of a Georgia special grand jury should put to rest any lingering questions about the validity of the 2020 election. The special grand jury was tasked with investigating whether there were ""possible attempts to disrupt the lawful administration of the 2020 presidential elections in the State of Georgia.""  They found, unanimously, ""that no widespread fraud took place in the Georgia 2020 presidential election that could result in overturning that election."" And damningly, a majority of the grand jury said that they believe witnesses may have lied to them while under oath — and that the district attorney should issue indictments where appropriate.  The grand jury spent months hearing witness testimony and evaluating the evidence. And it's worth noting that the public still does not know most of what is in their report, including who they believe should be indicted for perjury, the full list of who testified in front of the grand jury, and whether the grand jury recommended indictments for crimes beyond perjury. This means that the core findings of the special grand jury — whether Trump and his associates unlawfully interfered with the election in Georgia — are still hidden from the public. That we're even reading this much of the grand jury's report is to the credit of the free press and their demands for accountability and transparency. After a legal back-and-forth over whether the grand jury report should be released to the public — and after the jurors themselves voted to recommend that the report be published — a Georgia judge ordered the publication of small sections of the report, including the introduction, conclusion, and a section related to possible witness perjury. The full report, though, remains confidential, with the judge citing due process and fairness.  This special grand jury does not have the power to issue indictments; they are an investigatory body, and it's now up to the Fulton County district attorney to decide whether to present her case before a regular grand jury to decide if defendants should be indicted.  The information already in the public realm is damning. On Jan. 2, 2021, Trump spoke with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and told him to ""find"" the votes he needed to win. He also suggested that Raffensperger could face criminal penalties if he didn't do Trump's bidding. ""The ballots are corrupt,"" Trump told Raffensperger on their phone call. ""And you're going to find that they are — which is totally illegal, it is more illegal for you than it is for them because, you know what they did and you're not reporting it. That's a criminal, that's a criminal offense. And you can't let that happen. That's a big risk to you and to Ryan, your lawyer. And that's a big risk.""  He continued, ""And you can't let it happen and you are letting it happen. You know, I mean, I'm notifying you that you're letting it happen. So look. All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state.""  Trump campaign officials and other allies also cooked up a seven-state scheme to create fake groups of Electoral College delegates who would circumvent the real election results and instead cast their votes for Trump.  This information is not new. And it would have been far better — for the sake of transparency — if the special grand jury report had been released in its entirety to the public. But even these limited public findings are important, as they make clear that an impartial group of average citizens in Georgia — long a red state, now an increasingly purple one — will take a look at the evidence before them and conclude, to a one, that Trump's claim of a stolen election is a big, ugly, dangerous lie.  This conclusion seems unlikely to sway any of Trump's hardcore base, who have proven themselves to be largely unswayable. But it could influence a Republican Party in turmoil, divided over everything from their anti-abortion strategy to who should lead their party's ticket in 2024. Many Republicans want to move beyond Trump, with his unfiltered bigotry and never-ending drama and posse of hucksters and reprobates. But many of those same Republicans fear the stubborn and loud Trump base.  They should take a page from this special grand jury's book. It seems highly unlikely that every member of this jury was a liberal Democrat. While Biden won 76.2% of the vote in Fulton County in 2020, there were surely Trump supporters and people who usually vote for Republicans among the jurors. And yet those voters were able to set aside their partisan interests, recognize the weight of the task they were assigned and the power they held, and behave accordingly. They gave the evidence a fair read; they made recommendations that were, hopefully, based on the information before them and not on partisan interests. They weren't tasked with determining guilt or innocence, but rather with assessing whether the evidence before them supported bringing any criminal charges.  They were asked to assess whether it's possible that a former president and his allies had leveraged an attack on American democracy, or whether that president was telling the truth when he said the election was stolen.  They found that, contrary to the former president's claims, there was no evidence of widespread fraud undermining the results of the election, and that at least some criminal charges should be brought.  That's a much nobler conclusion than the one we've seen from members of the GOP, many of whom have largely opposed any efforts to determine responsibility for election-fraud lies, and have instead often doubled down on those lies. Even after the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol shocked the nation and left several dead, Republicans have mostly opposed efforts to determine what exactly happened and how.  If average people selected for a special grand jury can complete this task with honesty and integrity, surely it's not asking too much for Republican officeholders to approach their roles with similar gravity: To declare that the election was free and fair, and to ask that those who may have broken the law or lied be held accountable.  Now, any criminal charges are in the hands of prosecutors. But the future of the Republican Party — its fealty to democracy, to the country, and to truth itself — is in the party's own hands. They can move forward by telling the truth, seeking accountability, and trying to regain some integrity. Or they can move forward with the disgraced former President Trump.

Appeals court to hear dispute over Rep. Scott Perry's phone in January 6 special counsel probe,2023-02-17,"A federal appeals court will hear a dispute over Justice Department investigators accessing Rep. Scott Perry's cell phone in a case that could affect special counsel Jack Smith's ability to get information from him and other members of Congress. The case, currently before the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, will test crucial questions for both the ongoing grand jury probe and for the separation of powers, according to a newly released court filing -- the first made public in the sealed case. The legal dispute arises from prosecutors' inquiries around Perry, a Pennsylvania Republican who played a central role in supporting former President Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election.  A three-judge appellate panel will consider whether the Constitution protects US senators and representatives from scrutiny of their ""informal"" legislative efforts and whether constitutional protections around Congress mean members' communications with private parties and members of the executive branch can be kept secret. The line of questioning disclosed in a court order on Thursday implies that Perry's lawyers are arguing that prosecutors shouldn't be able to access communications he may have had with the White House at the end of Trump's presidency and any record of steps he may have taken in advance of the January 6, 2021, congressional vote to certify the presidential election.  In the lead-up to January 6 after the election, Perry was in contact with Trump and texted with then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, pushing to replace the US attorney general with an election fraud sympathizer. CNN previously confirmed that the case is over the Justice Department's ability to access data from Perry's cell phone. The circuit court hasn't disclosed that the court fight involves Perry, and much of the documents in the case are still under seal. Federal investigators had seized Perry's phone last August, imaging it then seeking a second search warrant to access its contents.  But Perry challenged the investigators' ability to take that step, citing protections around Congress under the Constitution's Speech or Debate Clause, which says senators and representatives  cannot be questioned. In practice, that has meant members of Congress' legislative papers and offices cannot be scrutinized by other parts of the federal government, including the Justice Department, and their votes and work as legislators can't become evidence in trials and grand jury proceedings.  A lower-court judge, Beryl Howell of the DC District Court, greenlit the investigators obtaining material, according to the court record, but the circuit has paused that while legal issues are still being argued.  In addition to the Speech or Debate Clause questions, the Circuit Court will also look at whether it has jurisdiction to hear the case. The case is set for oral arguments on February 23, and some of those proceedings will be public. The case will be heard by three Republican appointees: Karen Henderson, Greg Katsas and Neomi Rao. Both Republican and Democratic leadership in the US House made filings in the case as well, seeking to unseal the docket in Perry's case in order to protect the House of Representative's interests and preserve the Speech or Debate Clause, CNN previously reported. The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press also has said that the appeal shouldn't be litigated in secret. The case is one of at least eight proceedings related to the Smith's investigations around Trump that are taking place under seal and could have major implications for constitutional questions and for the special counsel probe.

Opinion: Biden's 'no apologies' speech should silence his critics,2023-02-16,"President Joe Biden has been criticized by members of both parties for not being more transparent and forthcoming about the decision to shoot down three aerial objects, just days after a US fighter jet took down a Chinese surveillance balloon off the coast of the Carolinas. But there may have been good reason for the lack of information made public in the days following the flurry of activity, and we should be patient as US authorities get to the bottom of what exactly these aerial objects are and where they originated from. Administration officials used cryptic descriptions to describe the three objects, with one said to be an octagonal object with strings hanging off it, sparking more confusion and questions of extraterrestrial activity (which the White House press secretary ruled out on Monday).  On Thursday, the President offered his first extensive remarks on the aerial objects, saying the three smaller ones were ""most likely balloons tied to private companies, recreation or research institutions studying weather or conducting other scientific research."" He also mapped out four measures to detect, monitor and establish rules and regulations around unmanned objects.  Biden's comments seemed to address the critics who argued that the administration has not shared enough information or sufficiently explained the apparent policy shift toward aerial objects in US airspace. Earlier this week, former President Donald Trump accused Biden of having ""surrendered American airspace to Communist China."" Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused Biden of causing ""global shame"" with his response. (Biden officials have said three balloons had flown over the US during the Trump administration, though it appears Trump officials weren't aware of the overflights.) Even Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal emerged from a classified briefing for senators on Tuesday and said, ""I have a better understanding, but the American people deserve and need to know more.""  The challenge Biden faces is not new. American presidents have often struggled to strike the right balance between transparency and secrecy when dealing with national security issues.   Sometimes presidents want to avoid fueling hysteria. Certainly, this was President Dwight Eisenhower's response when the Soviet Union launched the Sputnik-1 satellite on October 4, 1957. As public alarm mounted over the military implications of the launch, Eisenhower worked hard to contain fears. Speaking to the press days later, Eisenhower downplayed any concerns by saying there was ""no additional threat to the United States ... they have put one small ball in the air."" Eisenhower underestimated the emotional impact Sputnik would have on the public, however, and Democrats weaponized the moment, comparing it to Pearl Harbor and claiming the Republican administration was not doing enough in the Cold War.  But Eisenhower's response reflected his general disposition when it came to foreign policy and national security, as Evan Thomas documented in his book, ""Ike's Bluff."" He sought to do everything possible to avoid escalating the possibility of nuclear conflict.   Even as congressional Democrats ramped up their rhetoric about an alleged ""missile gap"" attributed to administration policies, Eisenhower held the line on military spending, focusing instead on investment in research and secret U-2 reconnaissance flights. Presidents have also held back information for strategic reasons. This was certainly true in October 1962 when President John F. Kennedy initially withheld that his administration had images of Soviet missile sites being built in Cuba. This allowed the US ambassador to the UN to publicly confront the Soviet ambassador and dramatically reveal concrete evidence of what the Soviets had undertaken. The moment was important, giving the US the upper hand in persuading other countries that the Soviets were to blame for the dangerous standoff.  And then there are instances when presidents are trying to refrain from acting or making public statements in haste — to avoid unnecessary military provocations, figure out the best military path to take and be able to adjust their stance as a situation unfolds. While we valorize firm and decisive decision-making, sometimes being an effective president means being willing to learn and change as new facts and opportunities emerge.    This was certainly true with President Ronald Reagan, who after 1985 displayed considerable flexibility and caution as negotiations with the Soviet Union eventually culminated in 1987 with the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF). Moving through many ups and downs over a two-year period, including the need to prevent the right wing of his own party from subverting progress, was not always easy. Indeed, Reagan had to withstand fierce criticism from conservatives who accused him of falling for a trap set by old Kremlin hard-liners and practicing the sort of appeasement he built his career opposing.  But in the end, he was successful. Restraint and flexibility produced a breakthrough agreement that accelerated the demise of the Soviet Union.    None of this is to say there aren't also terrible reasons for secrecy in national security.  Transparency is an important element of our democracy for a reason; there is a long history of American presidents withholding damaging information or conducting wrong — or even illegal — military operations, as President Richard Nixon did when he authorized secret bombings of Cambodia in 1969. In 1976, Democratic Sen. Frank Church campaigned to expose the way American presidents had relied on illegal domestic surveillance, attempted assassinations and helped overthrow foreign governments in their efforts to advance the US' national interest.   At this point there is sufficient reason to believe Biden has not been recreating the worst kinds of presidential behavior we've seen in the past. By all indications, it seems Biden exercised caution in shooting down the Chinese surveillance balloon and aimed to do so in a safe manner. It's likely Biden wanted to show China this kind of surveillance would not be tolerated while avoiding triggering a more dangerous confrontation between two superpowers. The risks are clear as US-China relations are deteriorating and Beijing has since accused the US of flying balloons over its airspace numerous times. (The White House denied Beijing's accusation and described the claim as an attempt at damage control.) As Max Boot argued in The Washington Post, ""A healthy concern about China's growing power is warranted, but paranoia and alarmism are not.""  On Thursday, Biden said he would make no apologies for shooting down the surveillance balloon, but stressed, ""We seek competition, not conflict with China. We're not looking for a new Cold War."" Regarding the other downed objects, the administration was concerned about the risk to commercial flights, given that they were flying at a lower altitude than the surveillance balloon. So far, the leading theory among US intelligence officials is that they were flown for benign purposes. Of course, we will learn more in the coming weeks as government officials collect and sift through the remains. Biden should continue to be as upfront with the American public as he can, disclosing what is safe to share while providing reassurance. Before Americans jump to the conclusion that this was all an example of botched foreign policy — or worse — it's worth remembering how many presidents have, for all the right reasons, wrestled with the difficult trade-offs of transparency when dealing with matters of national security. Although it doesn't always make for great movie plots, the complications of real-world presidential leadership can often produce messy but well-reasoned results.    This article has been updated with news of Biden's statement on Thursday.","{'neg': 0.386, 'neu': 0.614, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.5267}",47,136.0,0.0605,0.9395,0.0,-0.296,0.13,0.766,0.104,-0.9888,-13.911999999999999,-28.46543999999997,134.0,-0.21242865671641767
Nikki Haley's first days in GOP 2024 race preview the Trump balancing act awaiting other contenders,2023-02-16,"Nikki Haley's entrance into the 2024 Republican presidential race is offering the first demonstration of the difficult task awaiting other potential GOP candidates, as she seeks to stand out in what could become a crowded field -- without directly attacking former President Donald Trump or alienating his supporters. Since announcing her White House bid Tuesday, Haley has focused on her argument for generational change after a 2020 election in which both major-party nominees were in their 70s. On NBC's ""Today Show"" on Thursday, Haley called the questions about how she'll differentiate herself from Trump a media creation. ""You guys are obsessed with me talking about him,"" she said of the president who appointed her ambassador to the United Nations.  But that deflection ignored the reality that Trump and Haley are to date the only major candidates to officially enter the 2024 Republican race. And only one can win. Haley insisted that she is focused on defeating President Joe Biden, rather than engaging with Trump.  ""I don't kick sideways, I kick forward. And what I'm telling you is Joe Biden has not led,"" Haley said.  The questions Haley faces now are a preview of the Trump two-step that awaits every prospective Republican presidential hopeful: How can they prove their own mettle without alienating a base that remains loyal to Trump -- all while under a barrage of attacks from Trump himself?  How Haley navigates that question could provide lessons for other Republicans preparing to launch their own presidential campaigns.  For his part, Trump is showing no restraint in attacking those who could challenge him for the party's 2024 nomination.  On his social media network Truth Social, the former president claimed Thursday morning he had appointed Haley -- then the governor of South Carolina -- as United States ambassador to the United Nations as ""a favor to the people I love in South Carolina"" because he thought her then-lieutenant governor was better.  ""The greatest thing Nikki Haley did for our Country, and the Great State of South Carolina, was accepting the position of United Nations Ambassador so that the incredible then Lieutenant Governor, Henry McMaster, could be Governor of South Carolina, where he has done an absolutely fantastic job,"" Trump said on Truth Social. (McMaster has endorsed Trump's 2024 campaign.) He also pointed out Haley's previous pledges not to run for president if Trump was in the race.  ""I told Nikki to follow her heart, not her ambition or belief. Who knows, stranger things have happened. She's polling at 1%, not a bad start!!!"" he said on Truth Social.  Though Haley's early entrance into the 2024 race has made her a target this week, she isn't the first -- and won't be the last -- Republican forced to address similar questions about Trump.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis -- who Trump has called ""Ron DeSanctimonious"" -- experienced a preview of the same challenge earlier this month when Trump shared a photo on Truth Social that suggested DeSantis had behaved inappropriately with teenage girls while teaching history in Georgia in his early 20s. Rather than engaging directly with Trump, DeSantis deflected a reporter's question about the attacks. ""I spend my time delivering results for the people of Florida and fighting against Joe Biden,"" he said. ""That's how I spend my time. I don't spend my time trying to smear other Republicans."" Early polls suggest that DeSantis would be Trump's top rival in a hypothetical GOP primary. A new Quinnipiac University poll showed Trump with 42% support among Republican and Republican-leaning voters, followed by DeSantis at 36%. The Florida governor is expected to make an announcement about his next steps later this year, after the state legislative session ends. The challenge posed by Trump's presence could be much more daunting for others who start with much less support -- including Haley, who Quinnipiac found to have the third-most backing at 5%, and former Vice President Mike Pence and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who were both fourth at 4%. All three were members of Trump's administration, further complicating their efforts to break out in a field that includes the former president.  Other Republicans have similarly avoided direct conflict with Trump. New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, a sometimes-critic of Trump, appearing on CNN earlier this month as he weighs his own potential run, said he was joking when he called Trump ""effing crazy"" at a dinner and said he would support Trump if he is the 2024 GOP nominee. ""I don't think it's going to be Donald Trump, but yeah, I'm going to support the Republican nominee, to be sure,"" Sununu said.  On NBC Thursday morning, Haley was asked about her phone call with Trump ahead of her announcement -- the one in which Trump said on Truth Social he told her to ""follow her heart, not her ambition or belief.""  ""I'm going to keep that phone call personal,"" Haley said, as she insisted she did not seek Trump's permission to launch a 2024 bid. ""I didn't ask -- I told, that I thought that we needed to go in a new direction."" She faced similar questions Wednesday night on Fox News about how she'd differentiate herself from Trump on policy matters -- and deflected with the same assertion she'd use the next morning on NBC.  ""What I am saying is I don't kick sideways, I'm kicking forward. Joe Biden is the president. He's the one I'm running against,"" she said. Instead of staking out clear differences with Trump, Haley, 51, has focused her argument on generational change.  ""It is time for a new generation of leaders. You shouldn't have to be 80 years old to get to Washington,"" she said on NBC. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham told CNN on Wednesday that Haley's argument for generational change will be a popular one among Republicans seeking to topple Trump as the party's leader. ""She's trying to make the argument it's time for a new generation. I think you'll hear that a lot,"" Graham said. ""And I think Trump will have to make the argument that, I'm best able to step into the job, I did it once, I can do it again, I can do the job well.""  Former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh, once a tea party Republican who has broken with the party over Trump, said on Twitter that Haley's campaign launch is reminiscent of the 2016 GOP primary.  ""GOP elites dismissed Trump when he announced in 2015. But GOP voters on my radio show loved him. I thought again about that dichotomy listening to Nikki Haley yesterday,"" he tweeted Thursday, two days after Haley launched her campaign. ""She tried the whole 'morning in America' thing. GOP voters don't want morning in America. They want revenge."" Still, some Republicans -- including those who have embraced Trump's lies about widespread election fraud -- are aligning themselves with Haley.  Defeated New Hampshire Senate nominee Don Bolduc, who was backed by Trump, endorsed Haley and is campaigning with her in the Granite State on Thursday and Friday. And South Carolina Rep. Ralph Norman, who has been an ally of Trump, said on Facebook: ""There's absolutely NO QUESTION the Republican Party has entered a season of change. We're at a pivotal point, and most of the Republicans I know are now looking for new leadership with a new vision at the top of the ticket.""","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",60,137.0,0.06933333333333333,0.8194333333333332,0.11123333333333334,0.17239629629629635,0.057,0.812,0.131,0.9984,10.343777777777781,-9.425062222222188,183.0,-0.05150307225258026
"World Bank head David Malpass has 'no regrets' over leadership, following surprise resignation",2023-02-15,"World Bank President David Malpass plans to step down a year before his term is set to end, the organization announced Wednesday. Malpass will leave his position on June 30, the end of the World Bank's fiscal year, after serving more than four years in the role. ""It has been an enormous honor and privilege to serve as President of the world's premier development institution,"" Malpass said in a statement on Wednesday. ""With developing countries facing unprecedented crises, I'm proud that the Bank Group has responded with speed, scale, innovation, and impact."" Malpass told CNN's Julia Chatterley on Thursday he has ""no regrets"" over his four-year tenure. ""We've achieved many of the things I wanted to...I think it's really important that institutions have energy, new energy, and this is a good time for the World Bank to do that,"" he said. The World Bank, a group of 187 nations, lends money to developing countries to help reduce poverty. Former US President Donald Trump appointed Malpass as World Bank chief in 2019 for a five-year period. As the largest shareholder, the United States traditionally appoints its president. During Malpass' tenure, the organization responded to multiple crises, including a global pandemic and Russia's war in Ukraine. The World Bank said Malpass implemented record surges in finances in response to both. He also focused on policies to increase economic growth, reduce government debt burdens, and help reduce poverty. But his tenure has been controversial. Malpass faced criticism from climate activists in September after he refused to confirm during a climate panel whether he accepted the scientific consensus that burning fossil fuels were dangerously warming the planet. After an outpouring of criticism, many opponents called for his resignation. He later clarified to CNN that he was a not a ""a denier,"" and that fossil fuel emissions are ""clearly"" contributing to global warming. The World Bank also noted on Wednesday that it more than doubled its climate financing in 2022 to a record $32 billion. Malpass reaffirmed Thursday the World Bank's commitment to reducing debt payments for developing nations so they can instead fund crucial projects like climate adaptation. ""This reason this is important because the governments and the people of the countries need the money for food, for health, for education, for in nutrition and for climate adaptation. These are all pressing needs,"" he said. Malpass said he has ""decided to pursue new challenges"" and that this is an opportunity for a smooth leadership transition at the Bank Group. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Wednesday thanked Malpass for his service, saying in a statement: ""The world has benefited from his strong support for Ukraine in the face of Russia's illegal and unprovoked invasion, his vital work to assist the Afghan people, and his commitment to helping low-income countries achieve debt sustainability through debt reduction."" ""And while we all must continue to raise our collective ambitions in the fight against climate change, during President Malpass' tenure the World Bank has made important recent advances in this area,"" she said. Yellen also noted his commitment to ""ensuring a smooth transition"" and said the United States is looking forward to a ""transparent, merit-based and swift nomination"" for the next World Bank president. The opening also provides an opportunity for President Joe Biden to nominate an official who can implement the administration's green energy vision and help combat climate change while lowering energy costs for families.","{'neg': 0.383, 'neu': 0.5, 'pos': 0.117, 'compound': -0.5859}",25,138.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.093,0.756,0.152,0.9839,0.0,-8.960662222222188,199.0,-0.045028453378000946
Georgia judge releases parts of grand jury report on Trump and 2020 election,2023-02-15,"Portions of the highly anticipated report from a special grand jury in Georgia that investigated Donald Trump’s actions in the state after the 2020 election were released Thursday, revealing two findings of its monthslong probe but leaving many key questions unaddressed. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney ordered the limited release earlier this week, writing in his order that the report’s introduction and conclusion, as well as concerns the grand jury panel had about witnesses lying under oath, will be made public. Here are some of the key takeaways: No widespread voter fraud in Georgia: The special grand jury “unanimously” concluded that there wasn’t widespread voter fraud in Georgia in 2020, rejecting Trump’s conspiracy theories after hearing “extensive testimony” from election officials, poll workers and other experts. The grand jury’s conclusions on the fraud matter is important because it once again establishes that Trump was attempting to overturn the results of a legitimate election. That could factor into charging decisions by state prosecutors, who are weighing whether to indict Trump and his allies with crimes related to 2020. Potential perjury charges: The special grand jury recommended that Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis consider indicting some witnesses for perjury. The grand jury “received evidence from or involving 75 witnesses during the course of this investigation, the overwhelming majority of which information was delivered in person under oath.” But jurors clearly weren’t satisfied. Perjury “may have been committed by one or more witnesses testifying before it,” according to portions of the report disclosed Thursday.  Willis, a Democrat, has not brought any charges in the investigation at this time.  How the special grand jury operated: The panel — which had 26 members, including three alternates — operated behind closed doors over the past several months and started hearing evidence on June 1, 2022. It heard from 75 witnesses who played a range of roles in the 2020 election in Georgia. That testimony was usually delivered under oath. The grand jury also reviewed physical and digital evidence, as well as the testimony from investigators and the input of team of assistant district attorneys who outlined for the grand jury the applicable statutes and procedures. Most of the report remains under seal. “We set forth for the Court our recommendations on indictments and relevant statutes, including their votes by the Grand Jurors,” an excerpt from the report said. “This includes the votes respective to each topic, indicated in a ‘Yea/Nay/Abstain’ format throughout.” Read more takeaways here. Donald Trump’s campaign is standing behind the assertion that the former president ""did absolutely nothing wrong"" following the release of parts of a special grand jury report on its investigation into his actions in Georgia after the 2020 election. “The long awaited important sections of the Georgia report, which do not even mention President Trump’s name, have nothing to do with the President because President Trump did absolutely nothing wrong,” Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung said in a statement. “The President participated in two perfect phone calls regarding election integrity in Georgia, which he is entitled to do — in fact, as President, it was President Trump’s Constitutional duty to ensure election safety, security, and integrity,” Cheung added.  Cheung said other officials and attorneys were on the line during the calls and no one objected, ""even slightly protested,"" to what was being said.  Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis kicked off her investigation in early 2021, soon after a January call became public. Trump pressured Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to ""find"" the votes necessary for Trump to win the Peach State in the presidential election.   Jeff DiSantis, the spokesperson for the Fulton County district attorney, declined to comment on the release of excerpts from the special grand jury report. DiSantis declined to provide an update on when Willis might bring potential charges to a regular grand jury.  Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis' sweeping investigation has sought to determine not only whether former President Donald Trump committed crimes, but also whether there was a broader criminal conspiracy playing out in the efforts to overturn Georgia’s 2020 election results.  In document-preservation requests to Georgia officials in February 2021, Willis said she was investigating potential crimes including solicitation of election fraud, making false statements to government bodies, conspiracy, racketeering, violation of oath of office and violence or threats related to election administration. The Georgia probe was set off by an hour-long January 2021 phone call from Trump to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger asking him to “find” the votes necessary for Trump to win the Peach State. Over time, the investigation expanded well beyond the Trump phone call to include false claims of election fraud to state lawmakers, the fake elector scheme, efforts by unauthorized individuals to access voting machines in one Georgia county along with threats and harassment against election workers.  Willis also investigated the sudden departure of Byung “BJay” Pak, the former US attorney for the Northern District of Georgia. Along the way, Willis designated a number of people as targets of her probe, including 16 Georgia Republicans who served as pro-Trump electors in 2020 and Rudy Giuliani, who was working as a lawyer for Trump. While a special grand jury does not issue indictments, it possesses broader investigative powers than a typical grand jury in the state as well as the power to issue subpoenas for witness testimony, phone, email and other records.  With the special grand jury recommendations on indictments, Willis could then seek them from the other grand juries regularly empaneled in Fulton County. Willis has previously said she could pursue Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) charges in this case, allowing prosecutors to bring charges against multiple defendants and make the case that Trump and his allies were part of a criminal enterprise. Willis also considered bringing in John Floyd, a lawyer with deep expertise in racketeering cases, to assist her office. Portions of a highly anticipated report by an Atlanta-area special grand jury on their investigation into former President Donald Trump’s actions in Georgia after the 2020 election were released Thursday. The report’s introduction and conclusion, as well as concerns the panel had about witnesses lying under oath, was made public. Read the released portions of the report below: Parts of the special grand jury report released Thursday shed light on how the panel — which had 26 members, including three alternates – operated behind closed doors over the past several months. The grand jury began hearing evidence on June 1, 2022, having been empaneled a month earlier, and heard from 75 witnesses who played a range of roles in the 2020 election in Georgia. That testimony was usually delivered under oath. The grand jury also reviewed physical and digital evidence, as well as the testimony from investigators and the input of team of assistant district attorneys who outlined for the grand jury the applicable statutes and procedures. Most of the report remains non-public. But the released excerpts hint how it is structured. “We set forth for the Court our recommendations on indictments and relevant statutes, including their votes by the Grand Jurors,” the excerpt said. “This includes the votes respective to each topic, indicated in a ‘Yea/Nay/Abstain’ format throughout.” The still-secret report also includes footnotes where the grand jurors had the chance to clarify their votes the various recommendations, according to the public excerpts. In the report conclusion that was made public, the grand jury notes that its members were not legal experts in criminal law or election law. “The majority of this Grand Jury used their collective best efforts, however, to attend every session, listen to every witness, and attempt to understand the facts as presented and the laws as explained,” the excerpts said. GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina told CNN that he’s confident in his testimony to the Georgia grand jury in light of the recommendations that some witnesses should be indicted for perjury.  He told CNN he hasn’t heard from the district attorney after his testimony. He had no reaction to the recommendation. More on the investigation: The special grand jury, barred from issuing indictments, penned the highly anticipated final report as a culmination of its seven months of work, which included interviewing 75 witnesses from Graham to Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp to former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani. Michael Moore, the former US attorney for the Middle District of Georgia, said he expects indictments to follow the partial release of a report from a special grand jury that investigated Donald Trump’s actions after the 2020 election in the state.  A judge in Fulton County, Georgia, made portions of the report public Thursday. ""I don't think there's any question that we're going to see indictments come out of investigation,"" Moore said on CNN's At this Hour with Kate Bolduan. ""The (District Attorney) wouldn't have had the time and treasure invested into the case, to be at this place,"" and not have indictments, he continued. Moore said the question he's most interested to watch is whether or not Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis will pursue perjury charges for some of the witnesses questioned in the case, which he said ""may be tougher."" Moore said he's also watching for ""how broad the net will be,"" explaining that Willis faces a decision about whether to indict a few key targets or to be more sweeping in her actions. Either way, the district attorney  will have to be able to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt, and if she gains a conviction, support it on appeal. ""She's weighing those things out at the same time,"" Moore said. The former US attorney noted that it seems possible indictments will come ""in relatively short order,"" based on Willis' previous comments. The special grand jury in Georgia that investigated Donald Trump’s attempts to overturn the 2020 election “unanimously” concluded that there wasn’t widespread voter fraud, rejecting Trump’s conspiracy theories after hearing “extensive testimony” from election officials, poll workers and other experts. “The Grand Jury heard extensive testimony on the subject of alleged election fraud from poll workers, investigators, technical experts, and State of Georgia employees and officials, as well as from persons still claiming that such fraud took place,” the grand jury said in its final report, which was partially released on Thursday. The grand jury continued: “We find by a unanimous vote that no widespread fraud took place in the Georgia 2020 presidential election that could result in overturning that election.” The grand jury’s conclusions on the fraud matter is important because it once again establishes that Trump was attempting to overturn the results of a legitimate election. That could factor into charging decisions by state prosecutors who are weighing whether to indict Trump and his allies with crimes related to 2020.   The special grand jury recommended that the Fulton County district attorney consider indicting some witnesses for perjury, according to newly released parts of their final report in Georgia. The special grand jury wrote that the group believes that perjury ""may have been committed by one or more witnesses testifying before it,” according to portions of the report disclosed Thursday morning. ""The Grand Jury recommends that the District Attorney seek appropriate indictments for such crimes where the evidence is compelling."" The grand jury report does not name any witnesses along with that recommendation, or provide any other details about the witness testimony the special grand jury heard.  Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has not brought any charges in the investigation at this time. A judge in Fulton County, Georgia, has made public some parts of a report from a special grand jury that investigated Donald Trump’s actions after the 2020 election in the state. In his order on Monday, Judge Robert C.I. McBurney said that the special grand jury’s introduction and conclusion as well as concerns the panel had about witnesses lying under oath would be made public on Thursday. Some of the information in those sections still may be redacted, the judge noted. Prosecutors in Georgia have aggressively investigated whether Trump or any of his associates broke the law while trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat in the closely contested state. More on the investigation: The special grand jury, barred from issuing indictments, penned the highly anticipated final report as a culmination of its seven months of work, which included interviewing 75 witnesses from Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp to former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani and South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham. No one has been charged in the case yet. It will be up to Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis to decide whether to go to another grand jury to pursue indictments now that the special grand jury has presented its findings. Other findings by the special grand jury are not expected to be made public yet – particularly the parts where the report makes recommendations about potential charges. That’s because some of the people named in those recommendations may not have appeared in grand jury proceedings so far. Portions of a highly anticipated report by the Atlanta-area special grand jury that investigated Donald Trump’s actions in Georgia after the 2020 election will be released Thursday, giving the public its clearest look yet into the two-year probe into Trump and his associates’ efforts to reverse his election defeat. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney ordered the limited release earlier this week, writing in his order that the report’s introduction and conclusion, as well as concerns the panel had about witnesses lying under oath, will made be public on Thursday. Here’s what to know about the report’s release: Will it shed light on possible Trump crimes? The big question is whether the portions will include any bits of information that shed new light on what Trump himself did two years ago and whether the special grand jury concluded that the former president committed any crimes. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis’ sweeping investigation has sought to determine not only whether Trump committed crimes but also whether there was a broader criminal conspiracy playing out in the efforts to overturn Georgia’s election results. Trump lost to Joe Biden in Georgia by nearly 12,000 votes in 2020. The former president has insisted that there was nothing problematic about his activities contesting the election. What investigators are looking at:  The Georgia probe was set off nearly two years ago by an hourlong January 2021 phone call from Trump to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger asking him to “find” the votes necessary for Trump to win the Peach State. Trump has referred to it as a “perfect” phone call. Over time, the investigation expanded well beyond the Trump phone call to include false claims of election fraud to state lawmakers, the fake elector scheme, efforts by unauthorized individuals to access voting machines in one Georgia county as well as threats and harassment against election workers. Willis also investigated the sudden departure of BJay Pak, the US attorney for the Northern District of Georgia. Willis designated a number of people as targets of her probe last year, including 16 Georgia Republicans who served as pro-Trump electors in 2020 and Rudy Giuliani, who was working as a lawyer for Trump. What will and will not be in the release: On Thursday, the report’s introduction and conclusion, as well as concerns the panel had about witnesses lying under oath, will be made public. McBurney noted that some information in those sections might be redacted. Other findings by the special grand jury won’t be public yet – particularly the parts where the report makes recommendations about potential charges. That’s because some of the people named in those recommendations may not have appeared in grand jury proceedings so far. Its final report is likely to include some summary of the panel’s investigative work, as well as any recommendations for indictments and the alleged conduct that led the panel to its conclusions. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis suggested last month that the special grand jury investigating Donald Trump and his allies’ efforts to upend the 2020 election in Georgia has recommended multiple indictments and said that her decision on whether to bring charges is “imminent.” At a hearing in Atlanta on whether to publicly release the special grand jury report Willis, a Democrat, said she opposed making it public at the moment, citing her ongoing deliberations on charges. “Decisions are imminent,” Willis told Judge Robert McBurney. “We want to make sure that everyone is treated fairly, and we think for future defendants to be treated fairly it’s not appropriate at this time to have this report released,” she said. The special grand jury, barred from issuing indictments, penned the highly anticipated final report as a culmination of its seven months of work, which included interviewing witnesses from Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani. The special grand jury heard from a total of 75 witnesses, Willis said.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.8, 'pos': 0.2, 'compound': 0.4588}",98,139.0,0.07518181818181818,0.8246969696969696,0.10006060606060609,0.09227241379310343,0.082,0.77,0.148,0.9997,9.042696551724136,4.421474329501948,248.0,0.017828525522185276
Supreme Court removes oral arguments over Title 42 immigration policy from its calendar,2023-02-16,"The Supreme Court said on Thursday that it has removed a case concerning a controversial Trump-era immigration policy known as Title 42 from its calendar.  The court gave no explanation for its action, but the Biden administration has already announced that the Covid-19 public health emergency that serves as a legal underpinning of the program is set to expire on May 11. The program remains in effect.  Earlier this month, the administration told the court that it believes the expiration will moot the ongoing case. The Trump administration invoked Title 42 at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. The public health authority allows border officials to turn away migrants encountered at the US-Mexico border in the name of Covid-19 prevention.   Oral arguments in the case were set to occur on March 1. The justices' move represents the latest turn in the legal odyssey around the restriction, which has been the subject of ongoing litigation amid efforts to end it. US Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar informed the justices earlier this month that ""absent other relevant developments"" she thought the Supreme Court case would be moot after the health emergency expires on May 11, which would terminate Title 42.  Some critics of Title 42 are worried, however, that the May 11 deadline itself could come under separate legal challenges, leaving Title 42 on the books for weeks, if not months, longer.   Last year, Republican-led states, which had already filed suit in a separate court, requested to intervene in a case, arguing that the program should be left in place. The Supreme Court agreed to leave the program in effect and said it would hear arguments on March 1 on whether the GOP-led states can intervene. The Biden administration first announced it would suspend the public health order last April, with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention saying at the time that Title 42 was ""no longer necessary."" But that effort was blocked by a federal judge in Louisiana, until another federal judge in the District of Columbia ordered it to end. Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich -- who took the lead for the states -- has said that ""getting rid of Title 42 will recklessly and needlessly endanger more Americans and migrants by exacerbating the catastrophe that is occurring at our southern border,"" adding: ""Unlawful crossings are estimated to surge from 7,000 per day to as many as 18,000."" The Biden administration has continued to use Title 42 to send migrants who unlawfully crossed back over the border. The authority -- which was heavily criticized by public health experts and immigrant advocates -- has largely barred asylum at the US-Mexico border, an unprecedented departure from traditional protocol. Its end could restore access to asylum for arriving migrants, allowing them to enter the US and make their case in immigration court. This story has been updated with additional details.","{'neg': 0.156, 'neu': 0.636, 'pos': 0.208, 'compound': 0.2263}",16,140.0,0.034,0.8975,0.068,0.4215,0.097,0.851,0.052,-0.9757,6.744,12.218474329501948,246.0,0.049668594835373774
Takeaways from the partial release of a Georgia grand jury report on Trump and 2020 election,2023-02-16,"Portions of the highly anticipated report from a special grand jury in Georgia that investigated Donald Trump's actions in the state after the 2020 election were released Thursday, revealing two findings of its monthslong probe but leaving many key questions unaddressed.  Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney ordered the limited release earlier this week, writing in his order that the report's introduction and conclusion, as well as concerns the grand jury panel had about witnesses lying under oath, will be made public.  McBurney was clear that other findings by the special grand jury won't be made public yet -- particularly the parts where the report makes recommendations about potential charges. That's because some of the people named in those recommendations may not have appeared in grand jury proceedings so far.  No individuals were therefore listed by name in Thursday's release. The portions released Thursday were brief, totaling just nine pages.  Here are takeaways from the release:  No widespread voter fraud in Georgia The special grand jury ""unanimously"" concluded that there wasn't widespread voter fraud in Georgia in 2020, rejecting Trump's conspiracy theories after hearing ""extensive testimony"" from election officials, poll workers and other experts. ""The Grand Jury heard extensive testimony on the subject of alleged election fraud from poll workers, investigators, technical experts, and State of Georgia employees and officials, as well as from persons still claiming that such fraud took place,"" the grand jury said. ""We find by a unanimous vote that no widespread fraud took place in the Georgia 2020 presidential election that could result in overturning that election,"" it added. The grand jury's conclusions on the fraud matter is important because it once again establishes that Trump was attempting to overturn the results of a legitimate election. That could factor into charging decisions by state prosecutors, who are weighing whether to indict Trump and his allies with crimes related to 2020. Potential perjury charges The special grand jury recommended that Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis consider indicting some witnesses for perjury. The grand jury ""received evidence from or involving 75 witnesses during the course of this investigation, the overwhelming majority of which information was delivered in person under oath."" But jurors clearly weren't satisfied. Perjury ""may have been committed by one or more witnesses testifying before it,"" according to portions of the report disclosed Thursday. ""The Grand Jury recommends that the District Attorney seek appropriate indictments for such crimes where the evidence is compelling."" The pages released Thursday do not name any witnesses alongside that recommendation and do not provide any other details about the witness testimony the special grand jury heard.  Willis, a Democrat, has not brought any charges in the investigation at this time. During a hearing last month on whether to publicly release the report, Willis suggested that the special grand jury had recommended multiple indictments and said that her decision on whether to bring charges was ""imminent."" Waiting for word on Trump The most obvious and pressing question stemming from the Fulton County investigation is: Will Trump be indicted? The excerpts of the report that came out Thursday didn't move the ball forward in answering that question. Trump's name -- or the name of any subject of the investigation or witness -- wasn't mentioned. That means the waiting game continues.  The implications of Willis' decisions couldn't be higher. The 2024 presidential campaign is already kicking into gear, and Willis' decision on charging Trump could potentially scramble the Republican primary field. Trump did not testify before the panel. In a statement Thursday, his campaign again touted his ""perfect"" phone calls to Georgia election officials, saying he did nothing wrong. Willis' investigations started in early 2021, soon after a January call became public in which Trump pressured Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a fellow Republican, to ""find"" the votes necessary for Trump to win the Peach State in the presidential election. How the special grand jury operated Parts of the special grand jury report released Thursday shed light on how the panel -- which had 26 members, including three alternates -- operated behind closed doors over the past several months. The grand jury began hearing evidence on June 1, 2022, having been empaneled a month earlier, and heard from 75 witnesses who played a range of roles in the 2020 election in Georgia. That testimony was usually delivered under oath. The grand jury also reviewed physical and digital evidence, as well as the testimony from investigators and the input of team of assistant district attorneys who outlined for the grand jury the applicable statutes and procedures. Most of the report remains under seal. But the released excerpts hint how it is structured. ""We set forth for the Court our recommendations on indictments and relevant statutes, including their votes by the Grand Jurors,"" an excerpt from the report said. ""This includes the votes respective to each topic, indicated in a 'Yea/Nay/Abstain' format throughout."" The still-secret report also includes footnotes where the grand jurors had the chance to clarify their votes the various recommendations, according to the public excerpts. In the report conclusion that was made public, the grand jury notes that its members were not legal experts in criminal law or election law. ""The majority of this Grand Jury used their collective best efforts, however, to attend every session, listen to every witness, and attempt to understand the facts as presented and the laws as explained,"" the excerpts said. More of the report could come out More of the report could be released at a later date, according to the portions made public Thursday.

Biden's age is a hot topic as he looks to extend his time in the Oval Office until he is 86,2023-02-16,"When President Joe Biden went for his annual physical at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Thursday morning, he set a new record -- as he does every morning -- as the oldest US president ever. Biden's age is ""omnipresent"" in nearly every conversation, one person involved told CNN, at a time when he's preparing for a reelection announcement that would try to extend his time in the Oval Office until he is 86 years old.  Biden, 80, hasn't officially decided to run again, though he's said he intends to and his campaign infrastructure is largely in place. Even though aides say the president has told them that his age will not be the determining factor in his final decision about running for reelection, conversations about it are shaping everything from planning anticipated campaign schedule logistics to calibrating Vice President Kamala Harris' role as his running mate. White House spokesman Andrew Bates disputes how much of a factor the president's age is in conversations: ""That's simply not true, and makes one think they aren't involved in many conversations here."" That is leading to a focus on events that try to play up the president's vitality, while trying to strike a balance in the schedule of a man who tends to make more blunders when tired.   It also underscored the importance of a State of the Union address advisers viewed as Biden at his best, from cadence and delivery to his off-script sparring with Republicans in the House chamber. The speech served as a prime-time moment, in front of tens of millions of viewers, to lay out for the country the scale of his accomplishments and vision for the path ahead. And, at least implicitly, it also represented a window into why his age shouldn't be viewed as detriment to his efforts to lead the country down that path.  The effect was immediate with at least one group watching: quietly anxious Democratic officials. More than a dozen of acknowledged after the fact it was a night that either put to rest or went a long way in assuaging their lingering concerns about the party's leader.  That Biden repeatedly went back to the phrase ""finish the job"" roughly a dozen times during the speech ""wasn't exactly subtle,"" one of those Democrats said. Though advisers say Biden would keep to the standard of not starting daily campaigning for at least a year, just as President Barack Obama did in 2011, they're already looking for low impact ways to maximize keeping him in the public eye. To some extent it would track and build on the oft-criticized formula deployed in the lead up to the midterms, where Biden eschewed a road warrior, rally heavy strategy and tailored and targeted events -- and smaller crowds -- instead.  ""Funny that we didn't hear much from the critics about that strategy after November 8,"" one adviser said sarcastically of the Democrats' precedent-busting performance on Election Day last year. Among the possible strategies are having him keep up the kind of news-making appearances he's been doing in and around Washington and preparing for what they're hoping will be the most extensive digital effort of a presidential campaign ever. Top surrogates deployed at a regular clip would include a roster populated by a younger generation of politicians, people familiar with the matter say, even as one pointed out that given Biden's age, that's to some degree an inevitability. ""Like we did in 2020, if he runs in 2024 there will be a range of surrogates that show the diversity of the party, across all ages, from Maxwell Frost to Bernie Sanders,"" a Biden adviser said, referencing the 26-year-old freshman congressman from Florida and the independent Vermont senator. To many top Democratic operatives and officials looking ahead, Biden's age is the top issue of his reelection campaign -- in essence, what he's running against, at least until a Republican nominee emerges, according to CNN's conversations with three dozen White House aides, elected officials, leading Democratic operatives and others beginning to prepare for the race ahead.  ""It's part of who he is -- as much a part as his record of legislative accomplishments in the last two years, as much a part as his empathy and his connection with people,"" said a senior Biden adviser.  The adviser went on to spell out a theory of the case Biden's team believes will outweigh any concerns, no matter how persistent they appear in public polling.  ""At the end of the day, people are going to say, 'Who's on my side?'"" the adviser said. ""'Who's fighting for me? Who's getting things done and making a material difference in my life?'"" That's how Mitch Landrieu, the White House infrastructure coordinator, made the case to the antsy Democratic mayors he joined for a political meeting in January at a hotel a few blocks from the White House. ""People want to focus on one number -- the president's age, 80,"" he said, and let the words linger for just a moment.  The mayors looked around uncomfortably, according to two people in the room. They'd been thinking about Biden's age themselves, constantly hearing doubts he could or would run constantly from back home. They were startled to hear it said out loud by a White House official. ""But,"" Landrieu said, as he started to tick through stats around Covid-19 shots, jobs created, unemployment rates, ""there are a whole lot more important numbers out there."" Still, voters bring Biden's age up constantly in focus groups. Many veer toward assuming he must be ineffective or being puppeteered: ""'brain dead,' 'mush' -- 'dementia' is a word that comes up all the time,"" said one person who observed multiple focus group sessions during campaigns last year.  More than a dozen Democratic operatives and officials told CNN they're worried that Donald Trump -- himself a septuagenarian who is facing calls for new leadership from younger politicians in his party -- or another much younger Republican who may emerge as the nominee could make a show of seeming more energetic just by keeping a pace of two or three events each day. A number of prominent figures in the Democratic Party are privately questioning the president's ability to keep up an active travel schedule. A handful of ambitious Democrats have already quietly prepared rudimentary contingency plans in case Biden has a change of heart and decides against running for reelection, people familiar with the efforts told CNN. Those plans span everything from thinking through top donors to eyeing potential core campaign staff, should Biden reassess his ability to serve another four years or has an unexpected health problem, sparking a short fuse primary.  And while top White House aides bristle at any suggestion that the president's age is a liability, others in the building quietly worry that this may be actively underplaying the concerns that they're hearing from their own friends and family members. Other Democratic operatives preparing for a campaign worry about letting suspicions fester, comparing them to the conspiracies about hidden conditions that trailed Hillary Clinton throughout 2016.  ""They're going to be talking about it,"" said one top Democrat working on planning ahead for the reelection campaign. ""So, we've got to talk about it."" The president's opponents are talking about it. Right-wing media coverage of the classified documents found in Biden's former office and garage made him out to be either senile -- to explain why he hadn't remembered what happened to the documents -- or at the center of a conspiracy theory about a controversy manufactured by Democrats to ease him into retirement.  Texas Sen. Ted Cruz told CNN with a sorrowful tone in an interview last month, ""He's plainly diminished, far below the threshold needed to be a functioning and effective president."" Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders' Republican response to Biden's State of the Union used the line, ""At 80, he's the oldest president in American history.""  ""They attacked him over age before he beat them in 2020. They attacked him over age as he built the best legislative record in modern history,"" said Bates. ""They did the same before he beat them 2022. I'm not sure what they think they're accomplishing. The trend is not good for them. Maybe they forgot?"" It's not just them. Voters young and old often say they can't really believe he's going to run. Mocking him as ancient or asleep has become an easy joke for late night comedians. Many prominent Democrats privately say some panicky version of what Robert Reich, the 76-year-old former secretary of labor, wrote recently: Biden's age is ""deeply worrying, given what we know about the natural decline of the human brain and body.""  Biden advisers argue that most of the people making those kinds of comments are partisan Republicans, and that this is just another instance of a hyperpolarization in politics. They point to Biden's previous physicals and assessments by outside experts who say that he has no physical or mental competence issues at all.  Sure, there has been a noticeably increased stiffness to his walk since he's been in office, aides say, so much so that the White House physician, brought in a team to assess Biden's gait during his last physical in 2021. They concluded it was the result of normal ""wear and tear"" of his spine.  They acknowledge there are days where his energy levels at public events can appear less vigorous. But they are unequivocal about their view that Biden wouldn't green light another run if he didn't think he could do it -- and they wouldn't support one either. And they say these doubts are just the latest way of underestimating the president, pointing out that age concerns also dogged his 2020 campaign -- even though some of those same advisers confided to others at the time that they believed his age was his biggest liability when he was four years younger.    Asked what the argument will be for a 2024 campaign, the Biden senior adviser snapped: ""I've got two words for you: Wisdom and experience."" Those words, and an overall emphasis on Biden as an embodiment of reassuring routine and normalcy, pop up repeatedly among aides who are starting to look ahead.  They are also quietly reframing a key moment at the end of the 2020 primary campaign, when Biden was endorsed in March 2020 by the much younger Harris, Booker and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and described himself ""as a bridge"" to the next generation.  Many at the time took that to mean a four-year bridge, an implicit one-term promise that acknowledged his age. Advisers point out he'd previously rejected a one-term pledge. But people around Biden suggest, what he was talking about was not just getting Donald Trump out of the White House but getting past Trump and Trumpism. Advisers say that is what the logic around a 2024 run boils down to: Making the case that the only thing worse than an 82-year-old president is a Republican one.

Trump's former national security adviser Robert O'Brien appears before federal grand jury,2023-02-16,"Former national security adviser Robert O'Brien is appearing Thursday before a grand jury in the federal courthouse in Washington, DC, where several Trump-related investigations are being conducted.   O'Brien had been subpoenaed by special counsel Jack Smith as part of investigations both into classified documents found at former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence and the probe related to efforts to overturn the 2020 election, CNN previously reported.   CNN spotted two grand juries meeting at the DC federal courthouse on Thursday -- one of which has heard testimony related to the documents probe, while the other has been handling the investigation into efforts by Trump and his allies to undermine the election results.   It is not clear which grand jury O'Brien is appearing in front of, or whether he is scheduled to testify before both grand juries. O'Brien identified himself to a CNN reporter but did not disclose any other details about his testimony.   O'Brien could have knowledge of how classified documents were stored at Mar-a-Lago because the National Security Council should be involved in handling those documents at the end of a presidency.   According to CNN reporting, O'Brien considered resigning over Trump's response to the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol but ultimately decided not to.

Biden appeals court nominee faces questions for role in school sexual assault case,2023-02-16,"The confirmation of President Joe Biden's nominee for a prestigious federal appeals court seat could be in jeopardy after he was grilled over his role representing an elite boarding school in a sexual assault case and a key Senate Democrat withheld his immediate support.  Former New Hampshire Attorney General Michael Delaney, who has been nominated for the 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals, faced tough questions about the case from Senate Judiciary Committee members during a hearing Wednesday.   ""It was a pretty rough hearing, no question,"" Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin told CNN after the hearing. ""We're going to take a closer look at his record.""  Delaney represented the New Hampshire boarding school St. Paul's in a civil lawsuit brought against the school by the family of a student who had been sexually assaulted by another student. The school ultimately settled the lawsuit, and Delaney defended his approach to the case before the Senate panel on Wednesday. But he was scrutinized by senators for a motion he filed on behalf of the school arguing that the victim, who was a minor, should only be allowed to proceed with the case anonymously if certain conditions were met.  Durbin, who asked Delaney about the case, was one of only two Democratic members of the committees who showed up to question Delaney at the hearing. The other, Hawaii Sen. Mazie Hirono, told CNN she was inclined to support him; however, Durbin indicated after the hearing he was still undecided.  Another Democratic senator told CNN that the nominee ""has real problems"" and believes that neither Delaney nor the White House fully thought through this nomination. The senator was uncertain whether to vote for the nominee.  The White House is standing behind the nomination. Biden and Senate Democrats are hoping to keep up with what was a notable judicial confirmation effort in the first two years of the Biden administration, when a 50-50 Senate confirmed 97 Biden judicial nominees. Biden achieved that record, in part, because Democrats remained publicly united behind nominees that moved forward in the Senate.   Delaney was nominated in January for a New Hampshire seat on the 1st Circuit that has been open since March 2022.  His supporters, who include both Democratic senators from New Hampshire, point to the endorsements he's received from advocates for sexual assault victims, including the Obama-era head of the Justice Department's Office on Violence Against Women. They also note the work he's done on behalf of victims, particularly while he was in the New Hampshire Attorney General's office.  ""As a homicide prosecutor, I went into court all the time with victims of horrific violence -- often times, sexual violence -- and I know from those experiences, just how important the interaction between the judge on the bench and the victim of the crimes is,"" Delaney said at Wednesday's Senate hearing, He stressed that St. Paul's wasn't opposed to the victim's request for anonymity and said it was his ""expectation"" that the school would have acceded to the request, even if the conditions St. Paul's sought weren't granted.  ""I did my job in that case as an advocate, and I recognize if confirmed as a judge I would be playing a very different role,"" Delaney said.  The parents of the victim who sued St. Paul's attended Wednesday's Senate hearing and afterward pushed back on how he characterized his work on the case. The victim, Chessy Prout, decided to identify herself publicly after St. Paul's filed its response to her request for anonymity.  ""My head was spinning trying to understand his answers,"" Alexander Prout, the victim's father, told reporters after the hearing. ""Chessy clearly understood the intent of the motion. She read it, she came to my wife and I and said, 'They're trying to silence me. They're trying to intimidate me into silence. If they think they're going to do that, they have another thing coming.'""  The White House told CNN on Wednesday after the hearing that Delaney continues to have its support.  ""Former New Hampshire Attorney General Delaney has a strong track record of upholding the rule of law, including taking action to protect vulnerable victims,"" White House spokesperson Seth Schuster said in a statement, while pointing to the plaudits Delaney received for his work with sexual violence victims as the state attorney general. ""The White House has the utmost respect for sexual assault and domestic violence survivors, and expects Senators to take Mr. Delaney's full record into account when considering his nomination -- as the White House did before nominating Mr. Delaney to the First Circuit.""  Response to victim's request for anonymity under scrutiny  Delaney represented St. Paul's as part of his work at the law firm McLane Middleton, where he was a member of the firm's educational law practice.  The school was sued by the Prouts in 2016. Chessy Prout was sexually assaulted by an older student in 2014 and in a separate criminal case, her assailant was convicted of the use of an online service to seduce, solicit or entice a child under 16 in order to commit sexual assault but was acquitted on other more serious sexual assault charges.  In the civil lawsuit, the Prouts accused the school of ""fostering, permitting and condoning a tradition of ritualized statutory rape,"" arguing that the school was aware or should have been aware of a tradition known as ""senior salute"" in which seniors sought to ""score"" with as many underclass girls as possible. (The school denied many of the Prouts' allegations in the lawsuit, but reached a confidential settlement -- the specific details of which Delaney said Wednesday he was not allowed to discuss.)  Before the settlement, St. Paul's -- in a court document signed by Delaney -- issued partial objections to the request by the Prout family, who had filed the lawsuit as Jane and John Doe, that the victim's family be allowed to continue with the case under the pseudonym.  St. Paul's filing accused the victim's family of ""carefully planning and executing a national media campaign against the School designed to embarrass the School during its graduation weekend"" and said they should only be allowed to remain anonymous if they and their lawyers made no more public comments about the litigation while it was underway. Soon after the motion was filed, Chessy Prout came forward publicly as the victim, and the request for anonymity was withdrawn.  Tennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn said at Wednesday's hearing that the position the school took under Delaney's counsel was ""disqualifying"" and sent a ""chilling"" message to young women. Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, critiqued the legal authority that Delaney used to justify the school's posture.  Sen. Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, suggested Delaney's approach in the case went beyond ""zealous advocacy"" and into ""some really murky hinterlands.""  Other Republicans on the Judiciary Committee, however, sounded more open to Delaney's explanations, with South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham remarking on the support he had gotten from victims' advocates.  Delaney pushed back at the criticisms from the GOP senators and said that the school was asking the court in the case to take a position that had been ordered in a similar case in Washington, DC. He noted that the 1st Circuit has since adopted new precedent on the use of pseudonyms for sexual assault victims that he would follow as a judge.  ""The Prout family had a very strong interest in proceeding anonymously. There's no question about that,"" he said. ""The school was asking the court to restrict trying the case in the media, while that anonymity was being respected by the court.""  In a letter to the Senate committee about Delaney's nomination, Chessy Prout also accused Delaney of witness tampering in the criminal case against her assailant. She wrote that during the criminal case against her assailant, she witnessed Delaney speaking with several students, including some slated to testify in the trial, in a conference room at the courthouse.  Delaney on Wednesday vehemently rejected the witness tampering accusations. He told the committee that he did not meet with the students in question and had never interfered with witness testimony in his 30 years as a lawyer.  ""It would be fundamentally inconsistent with my duty as an officer of the court. It would violate both state and criminal laws, and it did not happen,"" he said.  Support from the home-state Democrats  As Democrats have pressed to counter the impact that former President Donald Trump has put on the judiciary, the stamp Biden can put on circuit courts is particularly consequential, as Trump ultimately put 54 of his nominees on the appellate bench.  Trump was boosted by Senate Republicans' tactics of removing the leverage home-state senators have -- known as a blue slip -- to veto appellate nominees for seats in their home states, after using that same tool to keep vacant court seats that opened up under President Barack Obama until a Republican took over the White House.  Even though Democrats have not restored the blue slip for appeals court vacancies under Biden, the White House has worked with home-state senators on selecting nominees for those seats.  New Hampshire Democratic Sens. Maggie Hassan and Jeannie Shaheen both spoke in Delaney's favor at Wednesday's hearing, with Shaheen referencing the support Delaney has received from former Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte, who was New Hampshire state attorney general when he was the deputy attorney general. Alexander Prout said his family had raised their concerns about Delaney to the New Hampshire Democrats and to the administration during the vetting process last year.  ""I think we're just extremely disappointed that we've reached this point,"" Prout said.

Democratic Rep. Barbara Lee files bid for open Senate seat in California,2023-02-16,"Democratic Rep. Barbara Lee filed paperwork Wednesday with the Federal Election Commission to run for US Senate in California, setting up her entrance into a primary that's shaping up to be competitive and crowded.   Lee hasn't made an official announcement yet, and a spokeswoman told The Associated Press that Lee ""is filing preparatory paperwork and her announcement will come before the end of the month."" Her filing comes one day after longtime Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein announced that she would not be seeking reelection next year. When she does formally join the race, Lee will face off with two other prominent Democratic contenders who announced Senate bids earlier this year, Reps. Adam Schiff and Katie Porter. Under California's primary system, all candidates run on the same ballot, with the top two vote-getters, regardless of party, advancing to the general election. According to her most recent FEC filing, Lee had just $52,000 in cash on hand entering 2023, putting her at a disadvantage compared with her well-funded rivals. Schiff -- who's also been endorsed by former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- had more than $20 million stockpiled at the end of the year, while Porter had more than $7.4 million.  Lee spoke of her plan to run for Senate with colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus in January, around the time that Porter formally kicked off her bid for the seat Feinstein has held since 1992.   Porter's campaign launch was followed weeks later by Schiff's announcement that he would also run for Senate. Both entered the race before Feinstein had announced her reelection decision, under the presumption that the 89-year-old would retire at the end of her current term. Even Pelosi's endorsement of Schiff was conditional -- saying she would support him ""if [Feinstein] decides not to run.""  A contest between Lee, Porter and Schiff would feature a contrast of resumes and identities. Lee, who represents an Oakland-area district, is currently serving her 13th full term in Congress, which she first entered after a 1998 special election. Her high-profile, lone vote against the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force, which authorized the war in Afghanistan and multiple subsequent overseas conflicts, earned her fierce criticism at the time.  If elected, Lee would also be just the third Black woman to serve in the US Senate, with none serving at present.   Porter was first elected to her Southern California seat in the 2018 midterms and has earned prominence and praise from progressives for her focused questioning of witnesses in House oversight hearings. She's also been endorsed by her former law school professor, Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.   Schiff, a Los Angeles-area congressman, was first elected in 2000 and gained national attention during the Trump administration, serving in high-profile roles on the House Intelligence Committee and in both Trump impeachment proceedings.  Additional contenders could join the open Senate race in the nation's largest state. Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna has publicly expressed interest in running. Other potential candidates include Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra -- a former California attorney general -- and San Francisco Mayor London Breed.

The West's hardest task in Ukraine: Convincing Putin he's losing,2023-02-16,"Ending the war in Ukraine on terms acceptable to its President Volodymyr Zelensky will require the West to convince Russian leader Vladimir Putin he's losing. Good luck with that. Ahead of next week's anniversary of the Russian invasion, US and Western leaders are gearing up for a show of unity and strength designed to establish once and for all that NATO is in the conflict for the long haul and until Moscow's defeat. ""Russia has lost -- they've lost strategically, operationally, and tactically,"" the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley said on Tuesday. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned Wednesday that ""Putin must realize that he cannot win"" as he explained the rationale for rushing arms and ammunition to Ukrainian forces. And Julianne Smith, the US ambassador to NATO, told CNN's Becky Anderson that Washington was doing all it could to ""continue to apply pressure on Moscow to affect (Putin's) strategic calculus.""  And in an opinion article by CNN's Peter Bergen, retired US General and former CIA Chief David Petraeus said the conflict would end in a ""negotiated resolution"" when Putin realizes the war is unsustainable on the battlefield and on the home front. The Western rhetorical and diplomatic offensive will ratchet up further as Vice President Kamala Harris heads to the Munich Security Conference this week. President Joe Biden will meanwhile visit Poland and a frontline NATO and ex-Warsaw pact state next week, bolstering his legacy of offering the most effective leadership of the Western alliance since the end of the Cold War. Viewing the war through Putin's eyes By most objective standards Putin already seems to be losing. His war aims of crushing Ukrainian sovereignty, capturing Kyiv, toppling an elected government, proving Russian might and severing Ukraine's relationship with the West have backfired terribly. Russia is a pariah state and its economy is in ruins because of international sanctions. Putin is being branded a war criminal. And far from being cut off from the West, Ukraine is now in the extraordinary position of being effectively a NATO client state propped up by the US and Europe, whose survival, even if there's an eventual ceasefire deal, will probably require decades of Western support. Yet Western logic about what is happening in the war may only disguise insight into Putin's mindset. The Russian leader long saw the world through a different strategic and historic lens. Many foreign observers, though not in the US government, convinced themselves after all that it was not in Russia's interest to invade Ukraine -- but Putin went ahead anyway. He's showing no sign of being deterred by a year of defeats and a stunning influx of sophisticated NATO weapons and ammunition into Ukraine. He's sending Russian convict recruits to their deaths in futile World War I-style advances even though Russian forces have already suffered massive losses. This war is also not some mere territorial dispute he's likely to give up lightly. It's born from his belief that Ukraine is not a country and must be folded into Russia. His survival in power could also depend on not being seen to have lost. And while the West says it's in for the long haul, Putin has already been at war in Ukraine since 2014 after the annexation of Crimea. A frozen conflict that lasts for many more years and prevents Ukraine becoming whole may be a sustainable position for him. He's already shown he's indifferent to massive human losses. And judging by his rhetoric he believes he's locked into a titanic geopolitical struggle with NATO vital for Russia's prestige. The question is whether the West has a similar appetite for the long haul. A crucial stage of the war All of this explains why western strategists see the next phase of the war as critical, as Russian forces prepare for an apparent spring offensive and Ukraine awaits the arrival of recently pledged western tanks that it hopes will turn the tide. NATO's unity and staying power has confounded skeptics, largely due to Biden's leadership. But political conditions in Washington and allied nations are not static and could shape Putin's thinking. In the US House for instance, some members of the new Republican majority are skittish. Florida GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz last week demanded an end to aid to Ukraine and for the US to demand all combatants ""reach a peace agreement immediately."" A bipartisan majority for saving Ukraine still exists in the House and the Senate. But it's not certain Biden can guarantee massive multi-billion dollar aid packages for Ukraine in perpetuity. And US aid might be in serious doubt if ex-President Donald Trump or another Republican wins the 2024 election. So while Ukraine's backers hope for breakthroughs on the battlefield, months more bloody fighting seem likely. CNN's Jim Sciutto reported this week that the US and its allies believed that Russia's coming offensive was unlikely to result in major battlefield gains. ""It's likely more aspirational than realistic,"" said a senior US military official. There are also doubts whether Ukrainian forces have the capacity to sever entrenched Russian defenses in the east and southern areas in a way that could threaten Putin's land bridges to Crimea. And Stoltenberg said Wednesday at a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels that the conflict was becoming a ""grinding war of attrition"" as he called on the allies to rush ammunition to Ukraine. Putin doesn't think he's losing The outside world knows Putin is not contemplating defeat or an exit from the war because of the complete lack of any diplomatic framework for ceasefire talks. Stoltenberg said on Wednesday that there's no prospect of this situation changing any time soon. ""President Putin shows no sign that he is preparing for peace. On the contrary, he is launching new offensives and targeting civilians, cities and critical infrastructure,"" Stoltenberg said in Brussels. Fiona Hill, a leading expert on Russia and Putin, who worked in Trump's White House, said at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Wednesday that there were few signs Putin's determination is waning. ""I think this is a pretty grim picture, in part because Putin didn't feel deterred in the first place,"" Hill said. ""The other thing is that Putin also feels that he has a lot of support from the rest of the world, including from China ... it may very well take countries like China, pushing Russia, for there to be any break in Putin's resolve."" The prospect of China leaning on Putin for an end to the war was remote even before the lurch in US-China relations caused by the flight of a Chinese spy balloon across the US this month. And even if Beijing might be embarrassed at Putin's performance in Ukraine after the two sides declared a ""no limits"" partnership last year, it may see an advantage in seeing the US preoccupied with a proxy war against Russia as it escalates its challenge to American power in Asia. US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman however warned Beijing on Wednesday that a long-term bet on Putin would only deliver disappointment. ""You're going to end up with an albatross around your neck,"" Sherman said at an event at the Brookings Institution, though admitted the US was concerned about tightening ties between China and Russia at a time when it is locked in simultaneous showdowns with each power. ""The Ukrainians are going to deliver a strategic failure for Putin. And that's going to create a lot of problems for those who are supporting this unholy invasion going forward,"" she said. The problem however is that there's no sign yet that Putin agrees.","{'neg': 0.195, 'neu': 0.602, 'pos': 0.203, 'compound': 0.0258}",54,147.0,0.081,0.8005,0.1185,0.3141,0.164,0.763,0.073,-0.9991,16.9614,56.55397500000004,142.0,0.398267429577465

Toxic train wreck Residents in the Ohio village of East Palestine are concerned about their health after a train carrying hazardous materials derailed there two weeks ago, sparking a massive dayslong blaze. The derailment on February 3 prompted crews to manage detonations to release vinyl chloride -- a chemical that can kill quickly at high levels and increase cancer risk. Although evacuation orders were lifted last week, some residents are staying elsewhere amid fears the lingering chemical exposure could be in the water, air, soil and on surfaces in the area. In a document sent to the EPA and recently made public by the agency, a company contracted for cleanup efforts did not list soil removal among completed activities. ""The people want answers. I want answers,"" said East Palestine mayor Trent Conaway, calling on  EPA officials to provide a more comprehensive update on the current situation. 2. Mall shooting One person was killed and three others injured in a shooting Wednesday night at a mall in El Paso, Texas, police said, sending patrons running or sheltering in a chaotic scene. The gunfire took place inside the Cielo Vista Mall, which sits next to a Walmart where a shooting in 2019 killed 23 and left nearly two dozen more injured. Two people, both male, were taken into custody. Police have not commented on possible motives. The incident on Wednesday is yet another example of shootings shattering the sense of security many Americans once felt in public spaces, like shopping centers, grocery stores and schools. So far this year, there have been more than 70 mass shootings across the US, according to the Gun Violence Archive.  3. Classified documents The FBI has conducted two searches at the University of Delaware in connection with the investigation into President Joe Biden's handling of classified documents, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN. FBI agents have also searched Biden's two homes in Delaware as well as the Washington office of the Penn Biden Center. The FBI found classified documents in one of Biden's homes and also took some materials from his time in the Senate from that location, CNN has reported, as well as at the Penn Biden Center office. Meanwhile, CNN has learned a third attorney for former President Donald Trump was recently brought before a federal grand jury investigating the mishandling of classified documents from his time in the White House. The DC-based grand jury is investigating obstruction in addition to criminal violations of government records laws. 4. Immigration Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis on Wednesday signed a bill expanding a controversial state program to transport migrants. The measure allows the DeSantis administration to pick up where the governor left off last year when he sent two planes of migrants from San Antonio, Texas, to Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. The action sparked multiple lawsuits and questions as to whether his administration violated state law by rounding up migrants in Texas. The budget law that created the program specified that the money was set aside to relocate ""unauthorized aliens from this state."" Additionally, since DeSantis has declared a state of emergency related to immigration, the program will allow the administration to award millions of dollars in no-bid contracts to companies to facilitate the transportation of migrants with little public disclosure. 5. Debt ceiling The federal government will be unable to fully pay its obligations sometime between July and September if Congress doesn't address the debt limit before then, the Congressional Budget Office said Wednesday. In other words, that's when the agency expects the Treasury Department will exhaust its ability to borrow additional funds using extraordinary measures. The CBO expects to revisit its projection in May after the current tax filing season closes and it has a clearer picture of how much federal tax revenue will come in this year. In the meantime, pressure is building for House Republicans and Biden to resolve their differences on dealing with the budget cap. GOP lawmakers are demanding spending cuts in exchange for raising the debt ceiling, while Biden is calling on Republicans to negotiate on reducing spending without holding the debt ceiling hostage.

Special counsel is locked in at least 8 secret court battles in Trump investigations,2023-02-16,"Special counsel Jack Smith is locked in at least eight secret court battles that aim to unearth some of the most closely held details about Donald Trump's actions after the 2020 election and handling of classified material, according to sources and court records reviewed by CNN.  The outcome of these disputes could have far-reaching implications, as they revolve around a 2024 presidential candidate and could lead courts to shape the law around the presidency, separation of powers and attorney-client confidentiality in ways they've never done before.  Yet almost all of the proceedings are sealed, and filings and decisions aren't public.  The sheer number of grand jury challenges from potential witnesses is both a reflection of the scope of the special counsel's investigation and a hallmark of Trump's ultra-combative style in the face of investigations.  By comparison, Robert Mueller's grand jury investigation into Trump had a smattering of sealed proceedings where investigators used the court to pry for more answers, and independent counsel Kenneth Starr's Whitewater investigation ultimately totaled seven similar sealed cases.  A key sealed case revealed Wednesday is an attempt to force more answers about direct conversations between Trump and his defense attorney Evan Corcoran, where the Justice Department is arguing the investigation found evidence the conversations may be part of furthering or covering up a crime related to the Mar-a-Lago document boxes.  A spokesman for Smith's office declined to comment.  About half a dozen cases are still ongoing in court, either before Chief Judge Beryl Howell or in the appeals court above her, the DC Circuit. Most appear to follow the typical arc of miscellaneous cases that arise during grand jury investigations, where prosecutors sometimes use the court to enforce their subpoenas.  More challenges from subpoenaed witnesses -- including former Vice President Mike Pence -- are expected to be filed in the coming days, likely under seal as well. Pence may raise novel questions about the protections around the vice presidency.   Investigations that implicate government officials often beget sealed court proceedings, because confidential grand jury witnesses become more likely to assert privileges that prompt prosecutors to ask judges to compel more answers, criminal law experts say.   ""I think we are in extraordinary times. Part of it is I think President Trump continues to assert these theories long after they've been batted away by the court,"" Neil Eggleston, a former White House counsel who argued for executive privilege during the Clinton administration and the Whitewater investigation.  In Whitewater, after the court in DC ruled that privilege claims wouldn't hold up when a federal grand jury needed information, other witnesses shied away from trying to refuse to testify, Eggleston recalled. But in the Trump investigations, witnesses aligned continue to test whether he still may have special confidentiality protections.  Still, the number of cases is out of the ordinary.  The other known cases are:  The Justice Department's long-running effort to enforce a May 2022 subpoena for all classified records in Trump's possession. After a sealed December hearing, Howell gave Smith's investigators an avenue to ask more questions of two people hired to search Trump's properties in December and found more documents with classified markings. Those two people testified to the grand jury late last month. Sixteen national media outlets, including CNN, have asked Howell to make public transcripts of hearings and other records in the case.  An appeal over whether former Pence chief counsel Greg Jacob and chief of staff Marc Short should have been forced to answer questions about Trump interactions around January 6. Both went to the grand jury in DC on the same Friday last July and refused to give some answers because of Trump's attempted claims of confidentiality around the presidency. Court orders prompted them to testify a second time, seeking out more testimony from them in October last year, CNN previously confirmed. They both appeared a second time at the grand jury. The Trump team still has filed an appeal of Howell's decisions.  An appeal over whether former Trump White House counsel Pat Cipollone and deputy White House counsel Patrick Philbin could decline to answer questions about direct conversations with Trump from the end of his presidency. Both men cited various privileges when they testified to the grand jury in September, but were forced to appear a second time and give more answers after court rulings in November and December, CNN previously confirmed. Though they have already testified twice, Trump's team filed an appeal.  Following the seizure of Pennsylvania GOP Rep. Scott Perry's cell phone in August in the January 6 investigation, lawyers for the congressman challenged the Justice Department's ability to access data taken from the phone, citing protection around Congress under the Constitution's Speech or Debate Clause. Howell refused to keep the records from investigators, but an appeals court panel has blocked the DOJ from seeing the records so far, according to indications in the court record. The case is set for oral arguments on February 23 at the appeals court in Washington. The circuit court also has a request from the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press to unseal documents in the case.  Both Republican and Democratic leadership in the US House have wanted a part in the case because of the implications for Congress, CNN has confirmed.   Howell has released redacted versions of two attorney confidentiality decisions she made last year giving prosecutors access to emails between Perry and three lawyers -- John Eastman, Jeffrey Clark and Ken Klukowski -- before January 6, 2021.   Howell separately denied Clark's attempt to keep from investigators a draft of his autobiography that discussed his efforts at the Justice Department on behalf of Trump before January 6. Clark had tried to mark the draft outline about his life as an attorney work product.  The Justice Department secured a court order for Trump adviser Kash Patel to answer questions under oath in the Mar-a-Lago investigation. Patel initially declined to answer questions before the grand jury in October, citing his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination. Then prosecutors fought for more answers by immunizing his testimony from prosecution, CNN previously reported.  Transparency is lacking  The suite of special counsel's office grand jury cases raises questions how transparent the courts will be regarding these cases, and how soon documents filed in court could become available.  The New York Times and Politico are trying to convince Howell to release redacted versions of any sealed court fights related to the grand jury where Trump or others in his administration have tried to limit the investigation with claims of executive privilege, according to court filings.  The media organizations argue there's a ""profound national interest"" in those legal papers.  But the Justice Department is against making disclosures related to the grand jury investigations -- and won't even admit the proceedings are taking place.   On Monday, they argued to Howell that with the intense public interest around the cases, there should be even more secrecy than when the court releases other records.   ""To advance the policy goals underlying grand jury secrecy, it may well be necessary for a court to more frequently decline to release judicial opinions ancillary to grand jury investigations that are the subject of intense press attention as opposed to matters that have attracted little public attention,"" lawyers from the DOJ's civil division wrote.  Howell is still deciding what to do.

What to know about the release of parts of a Georgia grand jury report on Trump and the 2020 election,2023-02-16,"Portions of a highly anticipated report by the Atlanta-area special grand jury that investigated Donald Trump's actions in Georgia after the 2020 election will be released Thursday, giving the public its clearest look yet into the two-year probe into Trump and his associates' efforts to reverse his election defeat.  Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney ordered the limited release earlier this week, writing in his order that the report's introduction and conclusion, as well as concerns the panel had about witnesses lying under oath, will made be public on Thursday.   Here's what to know about the report's release.  Will it shed light on possible Trump crimes? The big question is whether the portions will include any bits of information that shed new light on what Trump himself did two years ago and whether the special grand jury concluded that the former president committed any crimes.  Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis' sweeping investigation has sought to determine not only whether Trump committed crimes but also whether there was a broader criminal conspiracy playing out in the efforts to overturn Georgia's election results.  Trump lost to Joe Biden in Georgia by nearly 12,000 votes in 2020. The former president has insisted that there was nothing problematic about his activities contesting the election. In document preservation requests to Georgia officials in February 2021, Willis said she was investigating potential crimes, including solicitation of election fraud, making false statements to government bodies, conspiracy, racketeering, violation of oath of office and violence or threats related to election administration. ""I think that it is certainly possible that what is released ... will indicate that the special grand jury has found that there was criminal conduct involved in the activities of the Trump Campaign in Georgia after the election,"" said Clark Cunningham, the W. Lee Burge Chair in Law and Ethics at Georgia State University College of Law. Cunningham added to CNN that ""there is no doubt that whatever (the report is) referring to is either conduct that was done directly by Donald Trump or done on his behalf.""  ""That would tell us that this cross section of citizens, having spent nine months working hard at this, has concluded that at least some of what was done on behalf of the former president to overturn the election results was a crime,"" he said. ""I think that's terrifically significant.""  What investigators are looking at The Georgia probe was set off nearly two years ago by an hourlong January 2021 phone call from Trump to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger asking him to ""find"" the votes necessary for Trump to win the Peach State. Trump has referred to it as a ""perfect"" phone call. Over time, the investigation expanded well beyond the Trump phone call to include false claims of election fraud to state lawmakers, the fake elector scheme, efforts by unauthorized individuals to access voting machines in one Georgia county as well as threats and harassment against election workers. Willis also investigated the sudden departure of BJay Pak, the US attorney for the Northern District of Georgia.  Willis designated a number of people as targets of her probe last year, including 16 Georgia Republicans who served as pro-Trump electors in 2020 and Rudy Giuliani, who was working as a lawyer for Trump.    What will and will not be in the release The special grand jury, barred from issuing indictments, penned their final report as a culmination of its seven months of work, which included interviewing 75 witnesses, from Giuliani to Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham. On Thursday, the report's introduction and conclusion, as well as concerns the panel had about witnesses lying under oath, will be made public. McBurney noted that some information in those sections might be redacted. Other findings by the special grand jury won't be public yet -- particularly the parts where the report makes recommendations about potential charges. That's because some of the people named in those recommendations may not have appeared in grand jury proceedings so far. Its final report is likely to include some summary of the panel's investigative work, as well as any recommendations for indictments and the alleged conduct that led the panel to its conclusions.  No one has been charged in the case yet, and another grand jury in Fulton County would make those decisions now that the special grand jury has presented its findings to Willis.  During a hearing last month on whether to publicly release the report, Willis, a Democrat, suggested the special grand jury has recommended multiple indictments and said that her decision on whether to bring charges is ""imminent.""","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.857, 'pos': 0.143, 'compound': 0.4588}",26,150.0,0.06845454545454545,0.859,0.07263636363636362,0.04484444444444442,0.097,0.798,0.105,-0.1879,1.165955555555555,71.3619955555556,197.0,0.36224363226170353
Pence says he's willing to take fight against DOJ subpoena in Trump probe to Supreme Court,2023-02-15,"Former Vice President Mike Pence said Wednesday that he is willing to take his fight against a subpoena for his testimony in the Justice Department's 2020 election subversion investigation all the way to the Supreme Court. ""I am going to fight the Biden DOJ subpoena for me to appear before the grand jury because I believe it's unconstitutional and unprecedented,"" Pence told reporters after making a speech in Iowa.  He said he expects former President Donald Trump to bring his own challenge to the subpoena that will raise executive privilege claims. Pence, however, intends to fight the subpoena under the Constitution's Speech or Debate Clause, which shields legislators from certain law enforcement actions targeting conduct related to their legislative duties. While other witnesses have raised Speech or Debate Clause argument in efforts to resist subpoenas in the DOJ probe and in the other investigations into January 6, 2021, Pence plans to invoke the clause in relation to his role as president of the Senate -- which is believed to be untrod legal ground. In that role, he presided over Congress' certification of the 2020 election results on January 6, 2021. ""On the day of January 6, I was acting as President of the Senate, presiding over a Joint Session, described in the Constitution itself,"" Pence said. ""And so, I believe that that Speech and Debate Clause of the Constitution actually prohibits the executive branch from compelling me to appear in a court, as the Constitution says, or in any other place. And we'll stand on that principle and we'll take that case as far as it needs to go, if need be to the Supreme Court of the United States, because to me, it's -- it's an issue of the separation of powers."" He said that over the last ""several months,"" his team had made it clear to the Justice Department that he believed the Speech or Debate Clause precluded a subpoena for his testimony.  CNN previously reported on Pence's plans to raise claims under the Speech or Debate Clause. Pence also noted that he has written and spoken publicly about the events leading up to the January 6 certification vote. But, he said, ""if we were to accede to accept a subpoena for appearance before a grand jury or a trial, I believe that would diminish the privileges enjoyed by any future vice president, either Democrat or Republican. I simply will not do that."" Pence first spoke publicly about his plans to fight the subpoena at an event in Minneapolis earlier Wednesday, saying that his fight was about "" separation of powers"" and ""defending the prerogatives that I had as president of the Senate."" ""My fight is on the separation of powers. My fight against the DOJ subpoena very simply is on defending the prerogatives that I had as president of the Senate to preside over the Joint Session of Congress on January 6,"" Pence told reporters in Minneapolis. ""For me this is a moment where you have to decide where you stand and I stand on the Constitution of the United States,"" he added. Pence is one of several former members of Trump's inner circle whose testimony federal investigators have sought, as they scrutinize the events leading up to and during the January 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. That probe, as well as the federal investigation into Trump's handling of documents from his White House that were found at Mar-a-Lago, have taken a more aggressive tack since special counsel Jack Smith took over both investigations.

Exclusive: Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows subpoenaed by special counsel in Jan. 6 investigation,2023-02-16,"Donald Trump's former chief of staff Mark Meadows has been subpoenaed by the special counsel investigating the former president and his role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.  Special counsel Jack Smith's office is seeking documents and testimony related to January 6, and Meadows received the subpoena sometime in January, the source said. An attorney for Meadows declined to comment.  The Justice Department did not respond to CNN's request for comment on the subpoena. The move to subpoena one of Trump's most senior aides -- in addition to the recent subpoena of former Vice President Mike Pence, as CNN reported last week -- marks the latest significant step in the special counsel's investigation into Trump's role in seeking to overturn the outcome of the 2020 election.  Smith also is simultaneously investigating Trump's handling of classified documents after leaving office. While the subpoena is related to January 6, Meadows also may be of interest in the documents investigation. He was one of Trump's designees to the National Archives and played a role in discussions around returning government records in his possession. The special counsel's subpoena could set up a clash with the Justice Department and Meadows over executive privilege. The former White House chief of staff, citing executive privilege, previously fought a subpoena from a special grand jury in Georgia that was investigating efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. A judge later ordered Meadows to testify, finding him ""material and necessary to the investigation."" Meadows was involved in the infamous phone call between Trump and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and in a December 2020 White House meeting about election fraud claims. Meadows also visited a site where an audit of Georgia's election was underway and sent emails to Justice Department officials about unsubstantiated fraud allegations. On January 6, Meadows was in and out of the Oval Office and witness to Trump's actions as rioters overtook the US Capitol that day. The recent subpoena for Meadows also underscores the aggressive nature of the special counsel's probe. CNN has reported that Smith also has subpoenaed former Trump national security adviser Robert O'Brien in both of the Trump-related probes, and Justice Department lawyers interviewed Trump's former acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf in recent weeks as part of the probe into 2020 election interference.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.741, 'pos': 0.259, 'compound': 0.4939}",16,152.0,0.01757142857142857,0.9191428571428572,0.06328571428571428,0.30398000000000003,0.027,0.853,0.12,0.9876,4.8636800000000004,46.89807555555559,159.0,0.2949564500349408
House Judiciary chairman subpoenas big tech executives for company communications with executive branch,2023-02-15,"House Judiciary Republicans have subpoenaed the chief executive officers of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft for information about their companies' communications with the executive branch over how their content is moderated. The move by committee Chairman Jim Jordan is a notable escalation as part of the House GOP's effort to prove that big tech companies have colluded with the federal government to suppress conservative voices. The House Oversight Committee last week, in a hearing with three former Twitter executives, did not produce conclusive evidence that Twitter temporarily suppressed a New York Post story at the request of government agencies, and the former executives said the government played no role in the decision. The subpoena letters Jordan sent Wednesday, which are an escalation from the voluntary requests Jordan made in December when House Republicans were in the minority, ask for all requested documents and communications to be handed over by March 23, 2023.   ""To develop effective legislation, such as the possible enactment of new statutory limits on the Executive Branch's ability to work with Big Tech to restrict the circulation of content and deplatform users, the Committee on the Judiciary must first understand how and to what extent the Executive Branch coerced and colluded with companies and other intermediaries to censor speech,"" Jordan writes. In his December letter, Jordan alleged, ""Big Tech is out to get conservatives, and is increasingly willing to undermine First Amendment values by complying with the Biden Administration's directives that suppress freedom of speech online."" Jordan on Wednesday wrote to the big tech executives that he is not sending a subpoena to Twitter because it ""recently set a benchmark for how transparent Big Tech companies can be about interactions with government over censorship"" through its release of the internal communications dubbed the Twitter Files.  A Microsoft spokesman told CNN in a statement that the company is producing documents, is ""engaged with the Committee, and committed to working in good faith."" Meta spokesperson Andy Stone said the company has ""already begun producing documents in response to the committee's requests and will continue to do so moving forward."" CNN has also reached out to Amazon, Apple and Alphabet for comment on the subpoenas.  In an effort to rebut the House Oversight Republican criticisms of alleged collusion between Twitter and the federal government, House Oversight Democrats showed that the Trump White House had made requests to Twitter to take down tweets. One of the former Twitter employees testified last week, Anika Collier Navaroli, told the committee that she had heard the White House in 2019 flagged an expletive-laden tweet critical of then-President Donald Trump from model and TV personality Chrissy Teigen for removal.

6 key things to know after the toxic train derailment in Ohio,2023-02-15,"Weeks after a major train derailment and controlled explosion of chemicals in East Palestine, Ohio, residents have been encouraged to return home. But many questions remain about how the train derailed and what the lingering chemical exposure could be in residents' air and water.  Toxic train derailments don't happen very often, but they can have serious consequences for human and environmental health when they do. Here are some common questions, answered.   Why are hazardous materials transported by train?    America's railroads move a lot of chemicals. Freight trains moved 2.2 million carloads of chemicals in 2021, according to the Association of American Railroads.  This is in large part because railroads are considered the safest mode of transportation to carry large amounts of hazardous materials, including chemicals, for long distances across the country, according to the Federal Railroad Administration.  The agency's website says railroad accidents that resulted in hazardous materials being released caused just 14 deaths from 1994 to 2005, while 116 deaths resulted from hazardous materials spilling after highway accidents in the same time period.  Still, because trains are crossing state lines, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said he was concerned about the lack of information individual states have about what the rail cars are carrying.  During a Tuesday news conference, DeWine said the Norfolk Southern train that derailed was not categorized as a high hazardous material train, meaning the railroad was not required to notify state officials about what chemicals the rail cars contained.   ""If this is true -- and I'm told it's true -- this is absurd,"" DeWine said. ""We should know when we have trains carrying hazardous material that are going through the state of Ohio.""  DeWine urged Congress to consider updating hazard codes for trains so that states have more information.  How often does this kind of incident happen?  Rail has long been the default method of hauling bulk hazardous material.  ""It's the mode of transportation that's capable of moving bulk quantities,"" Federal Rail Administration spokesperson Warren Flatau told CNN. ""These commodities cannot be moved by pipeline; the alternative is moving them by truck over the highways, which is not looked upon favorably.""  Even though federal and industry statistics show that rail is a safer way to carry hazardous materials than truck or plane, spills and leaks still happen.   USA Today analyzed 10 years of federal rail incident reports and found over 5,000 incidents of hazardous materials spilling or leaking from trains that were either in transit or sitting in rail yards. In 2022, rail companies reported over 330 spills or leaks of hazardous materials -- of which only six caused an injury.  However, the USA Today analysis found that other forms of transportation are much more leak-prone: ""for every rail leak reported last year, there were two involving planes and 67 on highways.""  Federal Rail Administration data provided to CNN showed 149 incidents where hazardous materials were released from moving trains over the past decade.   It's important to note the federal data is being self-reported by train companies, making it tough to verify all the information is accurate.  Larger spills happen when trains derail. In 2018, a Norfolk Southern train derailed in Pittsburgh, spilling a load of mouthwash and releasing ""a strong odor,"" according to a city news release. Concern also heightened after the Trump administration allowed rail to transport highly explosive liquid natural gas -- a rule the Biden administration halted last year.   ""The real issue is the risk of derailment and explosion,"" Kimberly Garrett, a researcher and PFAS expert at Northeastern University, told CNN. ""If natural gas were to have a derailment like the vinyl chloride, it would be devastating.""  How do officials measure the damage and impact?  Ohio Environmental Protection Agency officials have been conducting air, soil and water tests since the controlled explosion of the chemicals inside the rail cars.   As of Tuesday, the EPA reported it had screened indoor air at 396 homes in the area, with 100 homes remaining. The agency has also screened the air of local schools and a library. It has also tested local waterways several times after a plume of contamination was released into them.   The EPA said Tuesday that there were chemicals spilled into the local waterways that lead to the Ohio River, but that much of it was contained. An initial plume of chemicals that was spilled into the waterway had made it to the Ohio River, but officials said they exist in very low concentration, and they are working with water facilities on enhanced filtration so they are not passed onto water customers.  That said, EPA and Ohio state officials urged residents in East Palestine to continue to drink bottled water for now. While most of the Tuesday news conference focused on volatile organic compounds -- chemicals found in common household products -- there are other kinds of chemicals that were released in the spill that don't diffuse as easily, according to Purdue University professor Andrew Whelton, an expert on disasters, environmental chemistry and water quality.  Whelton told CNN the EPA should also continue to monitor semi-volatile organic compounds, which are more persistent and detected in local waterways after the derailment.  ""Because of their size, they don't go in the air as easily,"" Whelton said. ""They like to stick to soils and other materials. The question is, how contaminated is the creek and what will they do to remediate that?""  If animals are dying, what does that mean for humans?  The chemical spill took a severe toll on local aquatic life: About 3,500 fish ranging across 12 species died from the water contamination washing down streams and rivers.  Anecdotal reports of pets and chickens dying have not yet been confirmed by officials. Mary Mertz, the director of Ohio's Department of Natural Resources, said Tuesday that there's no evidence that non-aquatic species have been affected by the spill.   The volatile organic compounds released by the controlled explosion can cause symptoms including headache, sore throat, and nose and eye irritation -- which some East Palestine residents have complained of. However, Ohio's state health director Dr. Bruce Vanderhoff said air quality doesn't appear to be behind the reported animal deaths near the derailment.   ""Anecdotes are challenging because they're anecdotes,"" Vanderhoff said. ""Everything that we've gathered thus far is really pointing toward very low measurements, if at all.""  Vanderhoff repeatedly told residents in East Palestine to use bottled water until testing on their water source is completed. He said it's especially important to use bottled water for people who are pregnant, breastfeeding or making infant formula.  What goes into cleaning up?  Ohio EPA and state officials have done several different things to try to contain pollution from the chemical spill. Crews have put oil containment booms in waterways and aerated contaminated soil and water.   Crews have excavated and removed nearly 500 cubic yards of ""vinyl chloride-impacted material"" including soil, according to Kurt Kollar, the on-scene coordinator for the Ohio EPA's Office of Emergency Response. The EPA is also blocking off ditches around the contaminated dirt so that it doesn't contaminate more water.  The EPA also said it has collected and stored nearly one million gallons of water in containers. Officials said the plume of initial contamination did flow to the Ohio River, but since that river is very large, ""it's a water body that's able to dilute the pollutants pretty quickly,"" said Tiffani Kavalec, Chief of the Division of Surface Water at the Ohio EPA.  As for drinking water, Kavalec said water treatment facilities should be able to remove the remaining low levels of volatile organic compounds in the water, and that the water will eventually be safe to drink.   What are the possible longterm impacts?   In addition to the chemicals officials say should break down with aeration and water treatment, environmental officials also need to test for PFAS -- a long-lasting and potentially more worrying class of chemicals used to put out chemical fires.  PFAS is typically found on non-stick pans and in some firefighting foams. EPA officials said Tuesday they had not yet tested the water for PFAS but would start working on it.   Whereas other chemicals can break down with exposure to sunlight, air and water, ""PFAS don't break down naturally,"" Garrett told CNN. The chemicals have also been linked to higher levels of some cancers.  ""PFAS migrating downstream would be my biggest concern,"" Garrett said.

Biden ramps up the pressure on GOP's economic agenda during Maryland speech,2023-02-15,"President Joe Biden traveled to Maryland on Wednesday trying to keep the focus on Republicans' legislative agenda after capitalizing on a viral moment over the future of Social Security and Medicare at last week's State of the Union address. Biden used his speech to further lean into his efforts to contrast his plans with Republicans' agenda, focusing particularly on the debt ceiling impasse as well as GOP-endorsed legislation that the administration argues would constitute ""a massive giveaway to the super-rich, big corporations, and Big Pharma.""  During the speech, the president told attendees at the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local Union 26 in Lanham that ""because of you, my economy is working."" ""It's a stark contrast to our Republican friends, who are doubling down on the same failed politics of the past. Top-down, trickle-down economics is not much trickle down ... in most kitchen tables in America,"" he continued.  Biden asserted that his upcoming budget proposal will cut the deficit by $2 trillion over 10 years and Americans making less than $400,000 a year ""will not see a single penny increase in taxes."" By contrast, he claimed that ""if you add up all the proposals that my Republican friends have offered just so far ... they would add another $3 trillion to the debt over 10 years.""  Republican members were heard calling the president a liar when he claimed during the State of the Union that some members of the GOP want cuts to Social Security and Medicare. And Biden questioned Wednesday whether they'll stick to their claims.  ""Where are they going to cut?"" the president asked of Republicans' proposed budget, which -- like Biden's -- has yet to be unveiled. ""Are they going to cut Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act? Are they going to cut Social Security or Medicare, veterans' benefits, aid to farmers? At the State of the Union they seemed to say that they're not going to cut Social Security and Medicare. OK, great. I hope that's true. But how are they going to make these numbers add up?""  The US has already begun to use extraordinary measures after the country hit the debt ceiling last month. The Congressional Budget Office said Wednesday that the federal government will be unable to fully pay its obligations sometime between July and September if Congress doesn't address the debt limit before then. In a fact sheet shared with CNN Tuesday, a senior administration official pointed to a series of efforts from of the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, which they said could lead to increasing the debt as a share of the economy ""by almost 10 percentage points."" Those bills include H.R. 23, the Family and Small Business Taxpayer Protection Act -- which the White House called the ""Tax Cheats Protection Act"" -- that the administration estimates would increase the deficit by $114 billion; legislation to repeal Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, which the White House notes would rise Medicare costs for seniors; and a bill to extend Trump-era tax cuts on the wealthy, which the White House says would add $2.7 trillion to the federal deficit over ten years. In the last several months, the president has repeatedly pointed to Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott's plan, which would sunset all federal legislation -- including Social Security and Medicare -- every five years and require Congress to pass them again. But Scott's plan didn't make it far. And Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell quickly dismissed it.  The president on Wednesday responded to Scott's debunked claim that the Inflation Reduction Act -- a Biden-backed law passed last year -- ""cut $280 billion out of Medicare.""  ""(Scott) says that because I'm cutting prescription drug costs I'm cutting Medicare. Where's he been? I think he's a little confused. We're saving Medicare hundreds of billions of dollars over time. We're strengthening Medicare because they'll no longer have to pay exorbitant prices to Big Pharma. We're saving millions of dollars in out of pocket expenses for seniors for drugs they need to stay healthy,"" Biden said.  The president's efforts to showcase his plans, which he says will ease the strain on American pocketbooks in a myriad of ways, comes amid what's been widely seen as a soft launch of the platform of his potential 2024 reelection bid.  He's used speeches over the last month to highlight his administration's legislative priorities -- particularly issues he often says are discussed at the kitchen table -- and how he wants to finish the job by implementing their rollout.  He discussed infrastructure in Maryland, Pennsylvania and New York. He stopped in Wisconsin to highlight job creation under his presidency and in Florida to slam some Republicans' proposed cuts to Medicare and Social Security. And, much like Wednesday's upcoming speech, he traveled to a nearby union hall in Virginia last month to hammer GOP economic proposals he has said would plunge the country into economic chaos.  The president also used a significant portion of his State of the Union speech earlier this month to share his plans to lower Americans' out-of-pocket costs, including efforts to lower junk fees, lower the cost of prescription drugs and maintain entitlement programs.  Biden has signaled his willingness to continue working with Republicans on negotiating cuts to spending, so long as they agreed not to use the nation's debt limit as a bargaining tool. But during Wednesday's speech, the president reasserted that he would not let the US default, adding, ""Sadly, what I'm hearing from the new leader of the House of Representatives and Republicans ... they're suggesting this cooperation has come to an end. Well, that'd be a big mistake for America."" ""Some of our Republican friends in the House are talking about taking the economy hostage over the full faith and credit of the United States,"" he continued. ""They say, unless I accept their economic plans -- which is totally irresponsible -- they're not going to pay the national debt, which took 200 years to accumulate.""  Behind the scenes, McCarthy is beginning to chart out a new strategy to ensure the House GOP can muster 218 votes to raise the national debt ceiling and tie that to an array of cuts to federal spending, as the standoff with the White House shows no signs of easing.","{'neg': 0.167, 'neu': 0.833, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.296}",44,155.0,0.121,0.803,0.076,-0.5994,0.099,0.81,0.092,-0.8278,-26.373600000000003,5.68503000000003,163.0,0.03487748466257687
Nikki Haley kicked off 2024 presidential campaign with calls for a new generation of leadership,2023-02-15,"Former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley argued Wednesday the nation was ready to move past the ""division and distractions"" that she said marked today's politics and called for a new generation of leadership as she kicked off her 2024 presidential campaign in Charleston.  The former twice-elected governor of South Carolina, who turned 51 last month, launched her 2024 campaign Tuesday in a video and will travel to the early-voting states of New Hampshire and Iowa in the following days. Her announcement could provide a jolt to what has so far been a slow-moving Republican primary campaign season, with many potential candidates hesitant to be the first to follow former President Donald Trump into the race. Trump launched his third bid for the White House in November. Haley on Wednesday touted her record in government and leaned heavily into her foreign policy experience as she sought to portray herself as the kind of leader who could strengthen a nation that she argued was ""on a path of doubt, division, and self destruction"" and ""a path of fading patriotism and weakening power."" ""I stand before you as the daughter of immigrants, as a proud wife of a combat veteran and as the mom of two amazing children. I've served as governor of the great state of South Carolina and as America's ambassador to the United Nations. And above all else, I'm a grateful American citizen who knows our best days are yet to come, if we unite and fight to save our country. I have devoted my life to this fight. And I'm just getting started. For a strong America, for a proud America, I am running for President of the United States of America,"" Haley said. If successful in the primary, Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants, would be the first woman and the first Asian American nominated by the Republican Party for president. Haley was born Nimrata Nikki Randhawa in Bamberg, South Carolina. A former president of the National Association of Women Business Owners, she was first elected to the South Carolina House in 2004. Six years later, she became the first woman elected as governor of the state and was the youngest governor in the nation when she took office in 2011. She resigned in the middle of her second term to become Trump's ambassador to the United Nations -- a role she served in until the end of 2018. ""I have always had a deep belief in America. But I know America is better than all of the division and distractions that we have today. And I'm confident that the American people agree. We're ready. Ready to move past the stale ideas and faded names of the past. And we are more than ready for a new generation to lead us into the future,"" Haley said on Wednesday.  Haley raised Trump in her speech Wednesday in the context of having worked with him during the Trump administration, but she did not criticize the former president who is her only announced rival for the Republican nomination so far. She instead focused her criticism on President Joe Biden over his handling of the chaotic withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, his foreign policy toward China, Russia and North Korea and his economic policies. She said it was ""unthinkable that Americans would look at the sky and see a Chinese spy balloon looking back at us,"" in reference to the Chinese surveillance balloon the US recently shot out of the sky.  Though she stayed away from overt criticisms of Trump, Haley did call for a ""mandatory mental competency tests for politicians over 75 years old,"" which would include both Biden, 80, and Trump, 76.  Haley called for term limits for members of Congress, strengthening border security, increasing domestic oil and gas production, condemned bailouts for big businesses and said under her leadership, ""Communist China will end up on the ash heap of history."" ""It will require doing some things we've never done -- like sending a tough as nails woman to the White House,"" Haley said. She later added, ""May the best woman win."" ""My purpose is to save our country from the downward spiral of socialism and defeatism. I aim to move America upward, toward freedom and strength,"" Haley said as she pitched her vision of America's future.  ""Strong and proud, not weak and woke, that's the America I see,"" Haley said. GOP Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina, who has been an ally of Trump, endorsed Haley for president in 2024 on Wednesday and said Republicans were looking for ""new leadership with a new vision at the top of the ticket.""  Norman praised Trump in the past, arguing in 2016 Trump was ""exactly who the Republican Party needed"" and that the country was ""better off now for what President Trump accomplished."" But Norman, who served in the South Carolina statehouse with Haley, argued it was time for a new chapter in the GOP. ""We're at a pivotal point, and most of the Republicans I know are now looking for new leadership with a new vision at the top of the ticket. There's also no question Nikki Haley has the right leadership qualities and vision to move our country forward,"" Norman said.  Cindy Warmbier, whose son Otto died days after he was released from North Korean prison in 2017, spoke in support of Haley at her campaign launch. ""I came here to tell you how Nikki Haley changed my life. To tell you that Nikki was a glimmer of light in the darkest period of my life. To tell you why America would be lucky to have Nikki Haley in the White House,"" Warmbier said Several people who have known Haley for decades describe her as ambitious, disciplined, extremely competitive and not afraid of making enemies. They point to her swift decision as governor to call for the removal of the Confederate battle flag from the grounds of the Statehouse in 2015 after nine people were fatally shot at a historically Black church in Charleston as an example of her bold leadership style and ability to take decisive action.  ""She's a hard charger,"" said state Rep. Nathan Ballentine, a longtime friend and ally who started out in the state legislature with Haley nearly 20 years ago. ""She's a pit bull when she gets something on her mind.""  Supporters hope Haley will gain traction among Republican voters who like Trump's conservative policies but are disenchanted with what they see as his erratic behavior and political bomb-throwing. Haley is more polished and focused, her backers argue, which could make her a more effective champion for conservative priorities.  ""Her strength is that she can lay claim to being associated with the policies that people like about the Trump administration, but she's not Donald Trump,"" said Chip Felkel, a Republican strategist in South Carolina.  Haley will likely face stiff competition in this lane from other potential GOP candidates such as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former Vice President Mike Pence and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who are all said to be weighing 2024 runs and could also appeal to conservative Republicans looking to turn the page from Trump. Some Republican strategists say a big Republican primary field would be advantageous to Trump, who still enjoys significant support among the party base, and could splinter the vote, allowing the former president to walk away with the nomination. In South Carolina, many of those base supporters of the former president, including June Avinger, the head of the Horry County Republican Women's Club, remain firmly in his corner and unlikely to switch to Haley.  ""If Trump wasn't running, maybe I would support her. But not against Trump,"" said Avinger, who wore a shirt with ""ULTRA MAGA"" stamped on it in glittery red and blue letters to attend a Trump campaign event in South Carolina last month. Trump won the South Carolina primary by 10 points in 2016, which helped propel him to the nomination amid a crowded Republican field.   In the Trump administration, Haley seemed to carry out a balancing act of allying herself with Trump while also distancing herself enough to appeal to his more moderate Republican critics. She left her post in the administration on good terms with Trump -- a rare feat -- but then publicly criticized him for his involvement in stoking the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. She told Politico at the time she didn't think Trump had a future in the GOP, but then months later said she wouldn't challenge Trump for the nomination if he ran for president in 2024. Haley later walked that sentiment back as she called for a new generation of leadership.  Following Haley's announcement, Trump said he told Haley ""she should follow her heart and do what she wants to do. I wish her luck!"" While Trump said publicly Tuesday that he wished Haley luck, he has privately expressed annoyance that the woman he once tapped to serve as his ambassador to the United Nations would challenge him. But Trump has remained the most anxious about another challenger: DeSantis. In recent weeks, Trump has asked multiple advisers about creating a new disparaging nickname for his potential rival, privately suggesting that he target DeSantis's weight instead of referring to him as ""Ron Desanctimonious."" Asked how Haley would likely respond to any attacks from Trump or other potential Republican rivals, Ballentine said, ""In the South, we say, 'Bless his heart' or 'Bless her heart.' That's what she'll do. She won't blast them on Twitter or be juvenile.""   Strategists say Haley is likely to continue highlighting the age gap between her and President Joe Biden, 80, and Trump, 76, particularly as many Democrats privately worry whether Biden is too old to run for reelection. Haley frequently posts on social media about her long-distance runs. Headphones in and slightly out of breath, Haley talks on Instagram about what songs she listened to on the eight- or nine-mile run she just completed. (The former governor is a big fan of legendary rocker Joan Jett.) ""I would think a critical part of her message would be that she's a daughter of immigrants, a woman, young -- all those attributes that compare positively to the old White male concept of the Republican Party,"" Felkel said. Haley opened her announcement video talking about how she felt ""different"" growing up in South Carolina. ""The railroad tracks divided the town by race. I was the proud daughter of Indian immigrants. Not Black, not White. I was different. But my mom would always say your job is not to focus on the differences but the similarities. And my parents reminded me and my siblings every day how blessed we were to live in America,"" Haley said. But others close to Haley say that while she is unmistakably proud of her heritage, she has been reluctant throughout her political career to lean into her identity and background to make political points and wants to focus her presidential message on her record as governor of South Carolina and UN ambassador.  ""I think you would see less of the governor leaning on identity politics and more on her record of re","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",76,156.0,0.045,0.8530434782608695,0.10195652173913042,0.19383500000000004,0.062,0.808,0.13,0.9993,14.731460000000002,18.275890000000032,218.0,0.08383435779816528
Syria's Assad hopes quake can help free him from global isolation,2023-02-15,"Eight days after a devastating earthquake struck Turkey and Syria, a relief plane touched down in the Syrian city of Aleppo, marking one of the biggest diplomatic feats for the country's isolated regime in over a decade.  The plane came from Saudi Arabia, one of the staunchest opponents of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his Iran-allied regime that has been accused of brutally suppressing an uprising th-t started in 2011.  It was the first Saudi plane to land at a regime airport in more than a decade, and it was aired prominently on both countries' state-backed media.   Not long ago, such a move would have been inconceivable. In 2016, a bombardment campaign by Assad and his ally Russia battered Aleppo in an effort to take back the city from opposition forces -- who at the time were supported by Riyadh.   After years of Syrian infighting, Assad -- with Moscow's help -- regained control of most of the country, with the exception of a northern strip still controlled by a number of opposition forces, some of which are backed by Turkey or the United States. The quake impacted areas within the regime's control as well as those held by the rebels, which relief workers have had difficulty accessing.   The quake has so far killed more than 41,000 in both Syria and Turkey.   Since the quake struck, the Syrian government has mobilized its officials and diplomats to make the argument that Western sanctions against it are hindering the aid effort, but activists and sanctioning states aren't buying that.  Syrian activists have warned that the Assad government is exploiting the earthquake to rehabilitate itself by calling on international donors to direct aid through Damascus, its capital, and remove the sanctions. Assad, they say, stands to benefit from the earthquake.  ""The earthquake gave the regime an advantage to survive politically,"" said Omar Alshogre, a Washington, DC-based Syrian activist who says he was detained and tortured by Assad's regime. ""Because the Syrian regime will use the earthquake to normalize itself.""  Assad was sidelined internationally after a 2011 uprising morphed into a bloody civil war between the regime and opposition forces, backed by foreign actors, who wanted to see him go.  Saudi Arabia has been one of the last major hurdles to regional normalization with Assad, whose regime was suspended by the Arab League in November 2011. But rumors have been circulating of late that Syria is close to being re-admitted, pending a no-objection from Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which is yet to reach out to Assad.  During a meeting with European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell this week, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal Bin Farhan emphasized the need to deliver aid ""to all parts of Syria,"" adding that ""we must ensure that the huge humanitarian burden on the Syrian people is lifted.""  Riyadh isn't the only foreign actor to coordinate with Assad's regime following the quake. The president has received a number of calls and visits from foreign leaders and diplomats. The United Nations and the EU have also heeded the Syrian demand for cooperation with the regime if they wish to deliver aid to victims in the country.  Among the harshest measures against the Syrian regime is the US' 2019 Caesar Act, which imposed wide-ranging sanctions to restrict individuals, companies or governments from economic activities that assist Assad's war effort. The act rendered the entire economy untouchable.   Some Western officials and analysts deny that sanctions are affecting aid deliveries. Still, the US Treasury last week issued a 180-day sanctions waiver on transactions related to earthquake relief.  Charles Lister, senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington, DC, said that ""there is no correlation between sanctions by the US and other like-minded partners around the world and the delivery of humanitarian aid.""  ""The real obstacles are political,"" he told CNN's Boris Sanchez, adding that the regime has constrained cross-border aid by placing a great deal of pressure on the UN to coordinate with Assad.  Alshogre, the Syrian activist, bemoans the UN's decision to coordinate with Assad despite the regime's human rights record, noting that Assad has in the past withheld aid to punish rebels.    But not everyone agrees that coordination will necessarily lead to the regime's rehabilitation.   Justine Walker, global head of sanctions, compliance and risk at the Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists (ACAMS), said difficult discussions will have to be had with the regime if aid is to reach all impacted areas of Syria. ""You cannot deliver humanitarian aid in a vacuum without that,"" she told CNN.  Walker, who worked on Syrian sanctions for years, stressed the importance of seeing the complexity that comes with sanctions, especially in the context of urgent humanitarian aid.  While sanctions are not the direct cause of slowed humanitarian relief in quake-stricken northwest Syria, they have created a restricted environment that makes it harder to send money, equipment and other forms of relief compared to a non-sanctioned country, she said.   From purchasing jet fuel in the sanctioned country to the overall risk appetite sanctions instill in various international actors, sanctions will ultimately complicate international aid in a situation like that of Syria, she said.  ""It really is as complex as it gets around humanitarian response and sanctions,"" she told CNN.  The Syrian government didn't respond to CNN's request for comment.  Many are skeptical that Assad will deliver aid to his adversaries in regions he once bombed.  The regime has maintained a ""siege and starve"" strategy over its opponents throughout the country, said Lister.   ""So if that aid goes through Damascus, there is an extraordinarily slim chance of any of it ever going into opposition-held areas of the country,"" he said, adding that as recently as last year, Assad stifled the flow of humanitarian aid from regime-held to opposition-held areas.

The digest  China calls for early resolution of Iran nuclear issue  China's President Xi Jinping on Tuesday called for the early and proper resolution of the Iran nuclear issue while expressing his support for the Islamic Republic in safeguarding its rights and interests, Reuters reported, citing Chinese state media. ""No matter how the international and regional situation changes, China will unwaveringly develop friendly cooperation with Iran and promote the continuous development of the China-Iran comprehensive strategic partnership,"" Xi said.  Background: A 2015 nuclear agreement limited Iran's uranium enrichment program to make it harder for Tehran to develop nuclear arms, in return for lifting international sanctions. But in 2018 then-US President Donald Trump ditched the deal and reimposed sanctions. China has criticized Washington for withdrawing from the deal and insists that the US should make the first move in reviving the pact. 
Why it matters: China and Iran, both at odds with the West, have been growing closer of late. Last year, they began the implementation phase of a 25-year cooperation accord under which China is to invest billions of dollars in Iran's petroleum sector in exchange for the supply of oil and petrochemical products.

UAE's COP28 president-designate says world needs climate 'course correction'  The UAE climate envoy and designated president of the COP28 climate summit said Tuesday that the world needed a ""course correction"" to limit global warming and that he would lay out an inclusive and innovative roadmap, Reuters reported. ""The world is playing catch-up when it comes to holding global temperatures down to 1.5 degrees and the hard reality is that global emissions must fall 43% by 2030,"" he said, referring to the goal of capping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius.  Background: The UAE has, alongside other Gulf energy producers, called for a more realistic transition in which fossil fuels would keep a role in energy security while making commitments to decarbonization. Jaber said policies should support growth and help battle climate change at the same time with capital as key. 
Why it matters: The UAE is a major OPEC oil exporter. Jaber also heads the state oil giant ADNOC and his appointment to lead the climate summit this year fueled activists' worries that big industry was hijacking the world's response to the global warming crisis. But he said on Tuesday his presidency would bring a fresh approach to tackle climate change challenges. ""As COP28 president, I will lay out a roadmap for COP28 that is inclusive, results-oriented and far from business as usual,"" he said.    US says 'deeply troubled' by Israeli government approval of West Bank settlements   The US is ""deeply troubled by Israel's decision yesterday to advance reportedly nearly 10,000 settlement units and to begin a process to retroactively legalize nine outposts in the West Bank that were previously illegal under Israeli law,"" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Monday. ""We strongly oppose such unilateral measures, which exacerbate tensions and undermine the prospects for a negotiated two-state solution,"" Blinken said in a statement.  Background: Israel's security cabinet Sunday gave official approval to nine Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, saying the move was in response to terror attacks in Jerusalem. The settlements already exist -- some of them for decades, the government said in its announcement -- but have not previously had official approval. Israel distinguishes between settlements which are authorized by the government and those which are set up unofficially, which it calls outposts. 
Why it matters: All Israeli settlements in the West Bank are considered illegal under international law because they are on land which Israel ca","{'neg': 0.146, 'neu': 0.378, 'pos': 0.476, 'compound': 0.7269}",64,157.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.099,0.811,0.091,-0.9854,0.0,13.412210000000032,266.0,0.05042184210526328

Still, experts say various obstacles need to be cleared before vehicles without human drivers become mainstream. Amazon's driverless transportation company appears to be moving in the right direction though, as it started testing its robotaxi on public roads this week -- with employees on board, for now. Here's what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.  (You can get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Presidential bids Former South Carolina Republican Gov. Nikki Haley announced Tuesday that she will run for president in 2024, becoming the first major rival to challenge former President Donald Trump for the GOP nomination. Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants, served as US ambassador to the United Nations under Trump. Haley will likely face stiff competition from other potential GOP candidates such as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former Vice President Mike Pence and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who are all said to be weighing 2024 runs. Some strategists say a big Republican primary field would be advantageous to Trump, who still enjoys significant support among the party base, and could splinter the vote -- allowing him to walk away with the nomination. 2. Alien speculation After the US military shot down three mysterious objects over North America last weekend, many people have questioned whether the objects could have originated from a hostile state or even from outer space. In an effort to tamp down on fears, the White House made it clear this week that no, this is not an alien invasion. ""I know there have been questions and concerns about this, but there is no -- again no -- indication of aliens (or) extraterrestrial activity,"" Karine Jean-Pierre, White House press secretary, said in a briefing Monday. A top White House official also suggested on Tuesday that the objects were likely harmless, and likely just balloons being flown for benign purposes. Officials say there is also no indication that the objects were connected to China's spy balloon program, which has commanded attention after the US shot down a Chinese spy balloon earlier this month. 3. New Zealand cyclone New Zealand declared a National State of Emergency on Tuesday for the third time in its history as Cyclone Gabrielle pounded the North Island. Heavy rain and strong winds have knocked out power to tens of thousands of homes, and killed at least four people, officials said. An additional 1,400 others were unreachable as of Wednesday night due to disrupted communication lines and power outages, according to police. The cyclone is the second significant weather event to hit Auckland and the upper North Island in just a few weeks. Last month, Auckland and surrounding areas were hit by record rainfall that sparked floods and killed four people. 4. FAA review The head of the Federal Aviation Administration has ordered a sweeping review of the agency following a series of recent aviation safety incidents. ""We are experiencing the safest period in aviation history, but we cannot take this for granted,"" Billy Nolen, the acting FAA administrator, wrote in a memo. ""Recent events remind us that we must not become complacent."" His memo comes after a technological breakdown led to the first nationwide airplane departure grounding since the 9/11 attacks, and two significant events where planes nearly collided on the runways of major US airports. One focus of the safety review team will be determining ""whether there are other incidents that resemble ones we have seen in recent weeks."" Nolen is set to appear before Congress today to address the computer outage that halted flight departures nationwide last month. 5. Ukraine A new report says the Russian government is operating a network of camps where it has held thousands of Ukrainian children since the start of the war. The report contains disturbing new details about the extent of Moscow's efforts to relocate, re-educate, and sometimes militarily train or forcibly adopt out Ukrainian children -- actions that constitute war crimes and could provide evidence that Russia's actions amount to genocide. The report, completed by the US State Department-backed Conflict Observatory, found that more than 6,000 children -- ranging in age from mere months old to 17 -- have been in Russian custody at some point during the course of the nearly year-long war. Russia's embassy in Washington dismissed the report as ""absurd.""

Otto Warmbier's mother to introduce Nikki Haley at Charleston campaign launch event,2023-02-15,"When Nikki Haley opens her presidential campaign on Wednesday she will be joined by Cindy Warmbier, whose son died days after he was released from North Korean prison in 2017. While many American voters wait to see how the Republican primary shakes out before picking a candidate, Warmbier is already all in.  Warmbier credits Haley with giving her the strength to continue fighting against the North Korean regime after the death of her 22-year-old son, Otto. She will tell her story on stage in Charleston, South Carolina, just minutes before Haley launches her presidential campaign. ""I said, 'It's impossible to fight North Korea,'"" Warmbier said of her conversation with the then-US ambassador to the United Nations when they met in 2018.  ""Well, you have to,"" Warmbier recalls Haley telling her. ""She says, 'You have to stand up to these bullies, these bad guys, because if you don't they view it as a sign of weakness.'"" Warmbier had admired Haley's determination when it came to North Korea sanctions and asked for the meeting when she was in Washington, DC, for then-President Donald Trump's State of the Union address.  ""It took someone like Nikki Haley to light the fire under me,"" Warmbier said in an exclusive interview with CNN. ""She took me out of that survival mode and put me in a fighter mode."" The anecdote underscores Haley's fierce approach to authoritarians, which is a part of the former US diplomat's identity that she wants to highlight as she introduces herself as a presidential candidate.  ""China and Russia are on the march. They all think we can be bullied, kicked around. You should know this about me: I don't put up with bullies and when you kick back it hurts them more if you're wearing heels,"" Haley said in a video announcing her 2024 White House bid on Tuesday.  'I'm speaking for her' Otto Warmbier visited North Korea in January 2016 with a travel group made up of other college students, but was stopped in security as he tried to depart from Pyongyang's airport. According to the North Korean government, he was detained because he had stolen a political poster. For his alleged crime, Otto Warmbier was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor. In the end, he spent 17 months in North Korea before being released as part of a deal brokered by the Trump administration.  When Warmbier returned to the US, he was in a comatose state and died in a hospital in his home state of Ohio. Following her son's death, Cindy Warmbier received advice from some who urged her to just take care of herself. But it was Haley's spirit of dogged determination that inspired her.   ""I don't want to be viewed as the victim. You know, I've survived. And because of Nikki Haley, I'm thriving. I'm here. I'm speaking for her. And I really believe in her campaign,"" Warmbier said. Haley and Warmbier have developed a close personal relationship, trading texts and emails over the years. Haley wrote about the Warmbiers in her book ""With all Due Respect,"" in which she also touts her efforts on North Korea sanctions.  ""We passed three separate and strong packages of sanctions on North Korea for its nuclear program. That meant doing what has never been done before, bringing China along,"" Haley wrote. ""By the end of my term as ambassador, we had sanctioned North Korea more harshly than any country in a generation."" While Trump was critical of North Korea leader Kim Jong Un in the immediate aftermath of Otto Warmbier's death, he said he did not hold the North Korean dictator responsible during their second meeting.  ""He tells me that he didn't know about it, and I will take him at his word,"" Trump said at the time. ""I don't believe that he would have allowed that to happen, it just wasn't to his advantage to allow that to happen."" Those comments prompted Warmbier's parents to clearly state that Kim and his ""evil regime"" were responsible for the death of their son.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",35,159.0,0.03925,0.9045,0.05625,0.0595,0.1,0.825,0.075,-0.9661,2.0825,13.753693333333366,269.0,0.051128971499380546
Justice Department tells court there's evidence of a crime in bid to force more answers from Trump attorney,2023-02-15,"Federal prosecutors investigating former President Donald Trump's handling of classified documents are asking a court to force his attorney Evan Corcoran to provide additional testimony, two sources familiar with the Justice Department's motion told CNN.   To overcome the shield of attorney-client privilege, prosecutors alleged in writing to the judge that the former president used his attorney in furtherance of a crime or fraud, according to one source.  The move represents the most aggressive yet by special counsel Jack Smith, who is leading the investigation. The case and filing remain under seal. Corcoran recently appeared before the grand jury for roughly four hours and is the third attorney to testify before the grand jury. He has not yet appeared a second time, and it remains to be seen if he ultimately does.  The New York Times first reported on the effort to compel Corcoran. It was unclear on Tuesday whether the Justice Department has developed new evidence to argue there was criminal planning, or whether prosecutors are resting on the same arguments made when prosecutors sought a search warrant for Mar-a-Lago last year. At that time, they had cause to believe federal records were moved or concealed within the beach club, and they have been investigating both mishandling of national security records and obstruction of justice. A spokesman for the special counsel's office declined to comment to CNN. A Trump spokesperson said the move was ""nothing more than a targeted, politically motivated witch hunt against President Trump, concocted to try and prevent the American people from returning him to the White House."" CNN previously reported that Corcoran first testified to the grand jury last month when he was asked about what happened in the lead-up to the August search of Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence, a person familiar with the situation said. Corcoran declined to answer some questions before the grand jury that would have divulged his advice to Trump and their conversations, citing attorney-client privilege, the source added. Corcoran had drafted a statement in June that attested Trump's team had done a ""diligent search"" and there were no more classified documents at Trump's Florida residence.  After that, the FBI searched Mar-a-Lago and found hundreds of government records, including classified material. The Trump team found even more classified material in subsequent searches they conducted and turned what they found over to the Justice Department. This story has been updated with additional details.","{'neg': 0.16, 'neu': 0.685, 'pos': 0.155, 'compound': -0.0258}",17,160.0,0.02566666666666667,0.8744999999999999,0.09983333333333333,0.3399666666666666,0.056,0.845,0.098,0.9525,5.779433333333332,45.9067266666667,242.0,0.18969721763085412
Here are the Republicans considering 2024 presidential runs,2023-02-14,"Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and United States ambassador to the United Nations, launched her bid for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination Tuesday.  But the primary is still in its early stages, and it could take months before the field fully rounds into form and candidates make more than occasional visits to states like Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina that will kick off the GOP's nominating process. Haley could stand alone for weeks or even months as the party's only official rival to former President Donald Trump.  Here's a look at who's in and who is considering a 2024 run for the Republican nomination:  Donald Trump: The former president officially launched his campaign in November, days after the midterm elections. And he never really stopped running after 2020, continuing to hold campaign-style rallies with supporters.  Nikki Haley: Haley launched her presidential campaign Tuesday. It was a shift from her previous insistence she would not run against Trump. ""It's time for a new generation of leadership to rediscover fiscal responsibility, secure our border and strengthen our country, our pride and our purpose,"" she said in a video announcing her bid. Ron DeSantis: The Florida governor emerged as the top alternative to Trump in many conservatives' eyes after his dominant reelection victory. A DeSantis announcement is likely months away, with Florida currently in the middle of its legislative session. But his memoir, accompanied by a media blitz, will drop at the end of February, and top advisers are building a political infrastructure.  Mike Pence: The former vice president's split with Trump over the events of January 6, 2021, kicked off a consistent return to political travel. He has made clear that he believes the GOP will move on from Trump. ""I think we're going to have new leadership in this party and in this country,"" Pence told CBS in January.  Tim Scott: The South Carolina senator would make a second Palmetto State Republican in the 2024 field if, as expected, he enters the race in the near future. Scott is building a political infrastructure, including hiring for a super PAC, and is set to visit Iowa for an event his team billed as focused on ""faith in America.""  Ted Cruz: The Texas senator and 2016 GOP contender has not ruled out another presidential bid. But he is also seeking reelection in 2024. ""I think there will be plenty of time to discuss the 2024 presidential race. I'm running for reelection to the Senate,"" he told the CBS affiliate in Dallas in February.  Glenn Youngkin: The Virginia governor's 2021 victory offered Republicans a new playbook focused on parental power in education. His political travel, including stops for a series of Republican gubernatorial candidates last year, makes clear Youngkin has ambitions beyond Virginia. He faced a setback to his push for a 15-week abortion ban when Democrats won a state senate special election earlier this year, expanding their narrow majority. Chris Sununu: The New Hampshire governor's timeline isn't clear, but he recently established a political action committee that borrowed his state's motto: ""Live Free or Die."" He has positioned himself as a strong Trump opponent and alternative within the GOP. He would also start with the advantage of being universally known in an early-voting state. ""I think America as a whole is looking for results-driven leadership that calls the balls and strikes like they see them and is super transparent,"" Sununu told Axios this week.  Kristi Noem: The South Dakota governor who won reelection in November has certainly cultivated a national profile, becoming a regular at conservative gatherings and donor confabs. But she hasn't committed to a presidential run. ""I'm not convinced that I need to run for president,"" she told CBS in January.  Greg Abbott: The Texas governor who cruised past a 2020 presidential contender, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, to win his third term in November is unlikely to make any official 2024 moves until his state's legislative session wraps up at the end of May. He told Fox News in January that a 2024 run ""is it's not something I'm ruling in right now. I'm focused on Texas, period."" Larry Hogan: The former Maryland governor is another Trump opponent. He told Fox News he is giving a 2024 run ""very serious consideration.""  Chris Christie: The former New Jersey governor is one of several 2024 GOP prospects headed to Texas for a private donor gathering in late February, along with Pence, Haley, Scott, Sununu and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp. Christie said on ABC earlier this year he doesn't believe Trump could beat President Joe Biden in 2024.  Asa Hutchinson: The former Arkansas governor is a rare Republican from a deep-red state who has been willing to criticize Trump. Now weeks removed from office, he also doesn't have the at-home responsibilities facing other governors. He told CBS that he'll decide on a 2024 by ""probably April."" He said he believes voters are ""looking for someone that is not going to be creating chaos, but also has got the record of being a governor, of lowering taxes."" Mike Pompeo: Trump's secretary of state and the former Kansas congressman said during a tour for his new book, ""Never Give an Inch: Fighting for the America I Love,"" that he would decide on a presidential run in the coming months. He's been among the Republicans most openly considering a run, traveling to early-voting states for more than a year.  Liz Cheney: The former Wyoming congresswoman who emerged as the foremost GOP critic of Trump's lies about widespread election fraud lost her House seat to a Trump-backed primary challenger. She launched a political action committee last year and made clear she intends to try to purge the GOP of Trump's influence. But what that means in the context of a potential 2024 bid is not yet clear. Will Hurd: The former Texas congressman who represented a border district recently traveled to New Hampshire, an early-voting state, though it's not clear whether or when he would enter the race. ""I always have an open mind about how to serve my country,"" he told Fox News.  Others to keep an eye on: Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, who fended off a Trump-backed primary challenge on the way to reelection last year, has added political staffers and is sometimes mentioned as a vice presidential prospect. Florida Sen. Rick Scott and Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley have both said they will not run for president in 2024 -- but things can change, and both had also taken steps to build their national profiles. Trump's former national security adviser John Bolton has teased a run as a Trump foil.

Stocks sink after inflation rose more than expected in January,2023-02-13,"US stocks rebounded from their worst levels of the day Tuesday following a stronger-than-anticipated increase in consumer prices.  The inflation figures fueled more fears that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates for longer than the market had hoped. Several Fed members made speeches Tuesday in which they talked about how the fight against inflation is not yet done.  Rising prices may have not put a dent in consumer spending, though. Retail sales figures for January are due out Wednesday morning, and economists are predicting a solid increase in sales following two months of declines.  In corporate news, shares of Tesla (TSLA) rallied 7.5% despite reports that workers of the electric car company in a Buffalo, NY solar panel plant are attempting to form a union.  More earnings are still coming, with investors results from Kraft Heinz (KHC) Wednesday morning and Dow component Cisco (CSCO) after the closing bell tomorrow. The Dow ended the day down more than 155 points, or 0.6%. The S&P 500 was flat. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.6%. As stocks settle after the trading day, levels might still change slightly. Wall Street bulls battled back against the bears Tuesday. Or is it a case of monetary policy doves fighting off inflation hawks? No matter who your investing animal spirit is, one thing is certain: Stocks enjoyed a solid rebound in the late afternoon after a mostly blah morning and midday trading session. The Dow was down only 60 points, or 0.2%, after falling around 400 points earlier.  The S&P 500 gained 0.2%.  The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.5%. Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were down nearly 1% at their worst levels of the day.  There was no obvious catalyst for the market turnaround. The morning's consumer price figures were higher than expected and several Fed members gave speeches today suggesting that the central bank is committed to fighting inflation. But the fact that the pace of consumer price increases continue to slow may be enough to keep the rally going. If your heart goes pitter patter when central bankers discuss inflation (you know who you are on Twitter!), then this may be the best Valentine's Day ever. Four members of the Federal Reserve (although not Fed Chair Jerome Powell) spoke on the economy today. First up was Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin, who is not a voting member on the interest-rate setting Federal Open Market Committee this year. Barkin said in an interview with Bloomberg TV Tuesday morning that there is ""more persistence to inflation than maybe we'd all want,"" adding that ""inflation is normalizing, but it is coming down slowly.""  Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan, who does have a vote on the FOMC this year, said in a speech later Tuesday that ""we shouldn't lock in on a peak interest rate or a precise path of rates."" But Logan did say the Fed will likely ""need to continue gradually raising the fed funds rate until we see convincing evidence that inflation is on track to return to our 2% target.""  The problem is trying to predict future economic data. ""When inflation repeatedly comes in higher than the forecasts...or when the jobs report comes in with hundreds of thousands more jobs than anyone expected...it is hard to have confidence in any outlook,"" she said. Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker sounded a little more dovish (i.e. less concerned about inflation) than Logan. He also is an FOMC voting member this year. Harker said in a speech Tuesday that ""we are not done yet"" with rate hikes but added that ""we are likely close."" Harker noted that ""at some point this year, I expect that the policy rate will be restrictive enough that we will hold rates in place."" Last up was New York Fed President John Williams, another FOMC member and also someone whose name has been mentioned as a possible successor to Lael Brainard as Fed vice chair now that President Biden is expected to name Brainard as his new top economic adviser. Williams said in a speech that inflation remains his top concern and that ""the inflation rate remains far too high."" That means more rate hikes are likely coming...even if they slow the economy.  Along those lines, Williams said that there will likely be ""a period of subdued growth and some softening of labor market conditions."" He said he expected real GDP growth of just 1% this year and that the unemployment rate will ""edge up over the next year"" to between 4% and 4.5%. The jobless rate is currently 3.4%. To find a silver lining in a 0.5% monthly headline inflation jump, look no further than the largest contributing factor to that increase. Shelter inflation, which set a new record of annualized growth at 8%, accounted for nearly half of January's monthly bump, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Tuesday. However, it lags market conditions by about 12 months.  New rental leases have cooled a little from their mid-2022 peaks, so there's a possibility that shelter costs could come down in the months ahead, said Christopher Rupkey of FwdBonds in a note Tuesday. ""CPI inflation reared its ugly head today, but for how long is the question, as it is only a matter of time until the turn in the housing market brings inflation down later on this year,"" he wrote.   Investors really did not like Tuesday's CPI report. Stocks tumbled in midday trading, as investors worried about persistent inflation leading to more interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve.  The Dow was off by about 350 points, or 1%.  The S&P 500 lost 0.8%.  The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.7%. Chevron (CVX) and Boeing (BA) were the only two Dow components that were higher...and not by much. Big Data giant Palantir (PLTR) was one of the few top companies bucking the downward trend. The stock soared after the company reported its first ever quarterly profit. Hopes that the Federal Reserve will hit the ⏸️ button anytime soon on interest rate hikes have seemingly been dashed after Tuesday's Consumer Price Index report. The pace of inflation probably isn't abating enough to convince the Fed to stop raising rates just yet.  With that in mind, futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange were pricing in a nearly 94% chance of another quarter-point hike at the conclusion of the Fed's next meeting on March 22 as of late Wednesday morning. That would lift rates to a range of 4.75% to 5%. The remaining 6% odds are for a half-point hike.  Looking further out, it is growing increasingly clear that the market is getting used to the idea that rates are going to have to keep heading higher. Fed funds futures are showing a 78% probability of another quarter-point hike in May, to a new range of 5% to 5.25%. That's up from a mere 33% likelihood for a May rate increase that was priced in a month ago. ""Inflation is still very elevated compared to normal levels. The Fed will need to remain hawkish and raise rates most likely at least two (possibly three) more times,"" said Eric Sterner, chief investment officer at Apollon Wealth Management, in an email.  ""We will most likely be under restrictive rate levels for all of 2023 until inflation is brought down to normal levels,"" Sterner added. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Tuesday morning renewed warnings that Congress must lift the debt ceiling to avoid “economic and financial catastrophe.”   The failure to raise debt limits, Yellen said at a conference for county officials in Washington DC, is a ""pressing issue that could threaten progress we’ve made over last two years,""  She warned officials that their own residents could lose jobs and that household payments on mortgages, auto loans and credit cards would rise. American businesses would see credit markets deteriorate, she added. ""On top of that,"" said Yellen, ""it is unlikely that the federal government would be able to issue payments to millions of Americans, including our military families and seniors who rely on Social Security."" Egg prices are still going up — way up — in the grocery store.  In January, egg prices rose 8.5% compared to the month before, according to inflation data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics Tuesday. In the year through January, egg prices soared 70.1%.  A highly contagious, deadly avian flu has wreaked havoc in the egg market, constraining the national egg supply. That, plus higher feed and transportation costs for producers, has raised prices. And some producers are also raising their own profits amidst the turmoil, causing some to demand a federal investigation into possible price gouging.  In the wholesale market, egg prices hit a record in December and have been steadily falling since then. But so far, those declines haven't reached consumers, as seen in January's numbers.  Plenty of other foods got more expensive this year as well. Some dairy product prices increased sharply: Butter spiked 26.3% and margarine rose a startling 44.7%.  Many other staples got way more expensive over the past year. Flour jumped 20.4%, bread got 14.9% pricier, sugar went up 13.5% and milk rose 11%. Chicken prices went up 10.5% and, together, fruit and vegetable prices increased 7.2%. Hot dogs got 11.4% more expensive. Breakfast sausages went up 10.1%. But there were some items that got less expensive. Bacon prices dropped 3.9%, and uncooked beef steaks fell 3%.  Overall, groceries got 11.3% pricier over the course of the year, while menu prices grew 8.2%. Together, food prices went up 10.1% for the year, eclipsing overall inflation of 6.4%. Ham prices jumped 3%, citrus fruit jumped 2.8% and packaged cookies got 2.5% more expensive. Bananas ticked up 1.5%, and rice went up 1.4%. Fresh fruit rose 0.8%.  But it's not all bad news. There were plenty of items that got cheaper last month.  Pork chops and hot dogs each fell by 3.5%, and fresh vegetable prices went down 2.3%. Tomatoes in particular saw a sharp decline, dropping 7.7%. Butter fell 1.7%, and milk 0.4%. President Joe Biden called the January Consumer Price Index report “good news for families and businesses across the country,” shortly after the report was released on Tuesday – despite the report showing inflation surged by the most in three months.  “Today’s data confirm that annual inflation has fallen for seven straight months,” the president wrote in a statement. “Inflation for food at the grocery store came down again last month. Gas prices are down about $1.60 from their peak last year. And real wages for working Americans are up over the last seven months, delivering welcome breathing room for American families.”  But he admitted there was “still more work to do as we make this transition to more steady, stable growth, and there could be setbacks along the way. As CNN reported earlier Tuesday, inflation rose in January, according to the CPI. Despite the monthly increase of 0.5%, inflation continued to slow on a year-over-year basis to 6.4%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's down from December's 6.5% but higher than economists' expectations of 6.2%. Palantir Technologies, the often secretive data analytics firm co-founded by tech investor Peter Thiel (who is also one of the co-founders of PayPal), posted its first profit ever after the closing bell Monday. Investors were pleased. Shares of Palantir (PLTR) surged more than 15% in early trading Tuesday.  The company, which generates a majority of its revenue from contracts with the US government and other government agencies around the globe, also suggested that the fourth-quarter profit of $31 million will not be a one-off. After years of racking up losses as the company prioritized revenue growth, Palantir now expects to generate actual earnings on a consistent basis.  ""A threshold has been crossed, and this is the start of our next chapter,"" said Alex Karp, Palantir CEO and another co-founder, in a letter to shareholders.  Palantir has been a controversial company, in part due to financial backing from the CIA in its startup days, as well as Thiel's ties to former President Donald Trump. Despite Tuesday's surge, the stock is still trading for just under $9 a share. That's about 75% below its peak price from January 2021, just a few months after the company went public via a direct listing of its shares. But Palantir was enjoying a strong 2023 even before its earnings report. The stock is now up more than 35% year-to-date. The company's growth is being driven by demand for its artificial intelligence tech. Several smaller AI stocks have also soared this year due to hype about the new ChatGPT bot.  US stocks opened lower on Tuesday morning following the release of January’s Consumer Price Index inflation report.  Investors fear the report underscores the Federal Reserve’s message that more work is needed to tackle inflation and that more painful rate hikes are ahead.  The futures market struggled for direction Tuesday ahead of the open as Wall Street tried to ascertain whether the modest climb in inflation is a change in trend for inflation or just a bump on the road to disinflation. In corporate news, investors will watch for fourth-quarter earnings from Restaurant Brands International and Airbnb after the market closes. Shares of Coca-Cola, meanwhile, fell by 0.9% though the company beat Wall Street expectations on Tuesday morning. The Dow was down 125 points, or 0.4%, on Tuesday morning.  The S&P 500 fell by 0.5%.  The Nasdaq Composite was 1% lower. The January CPI report showed that monthly prices were largely pushed up by shelter costs, which accounted for nearly half of the increase, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. Higher costs for food, gasoline and natural gas also contributed. On an annual basis, food prices remain well above overall inflation rates: Food-at-home prices are up 11.3%, with egg prices up 70% year on year, according to BLS data. The report also showed that the services excluding housing index — a closely watched measure by the Fed because of its connection to the labor market — increased 0.6% in January and is up 7.2% over the year. Inflation is clearly still a big economic problem. So what will the Federal Reserve do about it? The Fed is expected to raise interest rates again by another quarter of a point after its next meeting wraps up on March 22. That would bring the Fed's key short-term rate to a level of 4.75% to 5%.  Many investors have been hoping that the Fed would pause once it reaches 5%. But the central bank may no longer have that luxury. Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, rose at a faster-than-expected pace of 5.6% annually. That is particularly troubling. One strategist at Goldman Sachs said more rate hikes may be needed, especially if consumer spending is robust. “The strength of core inflation suggests that the Fed has a lot more work to do to bring inflation back to 2%. If retail sales also show strength tomorrow, the Fed may have to increase their funds rate target to 5.5% in order to tame inflation,” said Maria Vassalou, co-chief investment officer of multi-asset solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, in a report. The Commerce Department will report retail sales figures for January on Wednesday morning. Economists expect an increase of 1.8% from December following two straight month-over-month declines. A consumer rebound could put the Fed on its toes since it would be a sign that its previous eight rate hikes have yet to significantly slow down the economy and inflation. Stock futures were all over the place after the US government reported that consumer prices rose at a 6.4% clip over the past 12 months through January, higher than expected. Dow and S&P 500 futures were flat while Nasdaq futures were down about 0.3%. Stocks were indicating a higher open before the numbers came out.  Even though the Consumer Price Index report showed that inflation pressures aren't falling as fast as investors would like, the numbers are still heading in the right direction. That should mean the Federal Reserve will be able to continue raising interest rates by just a quarter of a point at its next few meetings. But the slowdown in inflation may not be quick enough to justify a pause by the Fed anytime soon. Inflation surged in January by the most in three months, according to the latest Consumer Price Index, released Tuesday. Despite the monthly increase of 0.5%, inflation continued to slow on a year-over-year basis to 6.4%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's down from December's 6.5% and higher than economists' expectations of 6.2%. Read more Stocks: US stock futures were higher ahead of another key inflation report. Dow futures were up 30 points, or 0.1%. S&P 500 futures rose 0.1%. Nasdaq Composite futures were 0.2% higher.  Fear & Greed Index: 71 = Greed  Oil & gas: US oil prices fell 1.5% below $79 barrel. Average US gas prices fell to $3.41 a gallon.  Newly revised inflation data showed Friday that December consumer prices rose from the month before and did not fall as previously thought. That's according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which said prices rose 0.1% on a seasonally adjusted basis in December from November versus a previously estimated decline of 0.1%. Every year, the BLS recalculates seasonal adjustment factors for the Consumer Price Index going back five years.  The latest annual adjustments show slight shifts in the month-on-month inflation trend for 2022 — with November and October revised up by 0.1 percentage points. Core CPI, which excludes the more volatile categories of food and energy, saw upward revisions of 0.1 percentage points in December and November to 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively. The latest BLS tweaks show the importance of not reading into any one data point but instead reviewing a variety of different metrics over a longer-term period, he said, a point that has been repeatedly stressed by officials such as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen as they measure the path of inflation.

Consumers are expecting inflation to remain high and their incomes to take a hit during the next 12 months, according to survey results released Monday by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The New York Fed's January 2023 Survey of Consumer Expectations showed that median inflation expectations for the year ahead held steady at 5%. Looking three years and five years out, Americans expect inflation to be 2.7% (a decrease of 0.3 percentage points) and 2.5% (an increase of 0.1 percentage points), respectively.  Consumers' expectations about inflation are being watched closely by the Fed as it engages in a long battle to bring down high prices. Higher inflation expectations could lead to an increase in workers bargaining for higher wages which, in turn, could drive pricing upward. The January survey showed that consumers don't expect their take-home pay to change much during the next year: Median one-year-ahead expected earnings held at 3%. It's been within the 2.8% to 3% range since September 2021.  The biggest shift seen among survey respondents was about their household finances. The median expected growth in household income registered at 3.3% last month, a 1.3 percentage point decline from December, when those expectations hit a record high.  While it's the largest month-on-month drop in the nearly 10 years the New York Fed has conducted the survey, the median income expectations are just below the 12-month running average of 3.5% and remain above pre-pandemic levels. Additionally, respondents indicated they planned to slightly curtail spending — spending growth expectations fell to 5.7% from 5.9% — and also anticipated a greater chance of missing a minimum debt payment during the next three months (increased to 12.1% from 11.4%). If ""transitory"" was the buzzword for inflation watchers in 2021, this year it's ""supercore."" Federal Reserve officials and economists were taken to task for dismissing inflation as temporary earlier in the pandemic, so now they're slicing and dicing inflation data in different ways. The new favorite: supercore inflation.  Supercore inflation refers to prices that rise when workers get paid more for their services. Think haircuts, electrical work and gardening. Those prices are typically less volatile than food and energy and can better indicate the direction of prices in the US economy.  Core services that exclude housing ""may be the most important category for understanding the future evolution of core inflation,"" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said recently. That's a problem: Supercore prices have remained stubbornly high in recent years. ""Supercore inflation was a strong 6.4% on a year-over-year basis through December 2022, but it is moderating,"" said Mark Zandi, Moody's chief economist. For the three months through December, supercore inflation is up only 2.4% annualized, and just 0.9% annualized in the month of December.   But supercore isn't a perfect gauge.

Opinion: Nikki Haley is a poor 2024 GOP candidate,2023-02-15,"I first met Nikki Haley during her initial run for governor of South Carolina in 2010 at a luncheon at Magnolia's, a Myrtle Beach buffet-style restaurant popular with the locals. Though she had served in the state's House of Representatives for several years, I didn't know her well -- and neither did most people in the state.    The luncheon was being hosted in the aftermath of the scandal plaguing South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, who had snuck out of the country to see his mistress but told his staff he was hiking on the Appalachian Trail. After listening to Haley give a fairly routine stump speech, I asked Haley, if she won, would she resign as governor if she made as big a misstep as Sanford had.    ""I won't mess up like him,"" she said without hesitation.   As governor of South Carolina, she never messed up like Sanford, who also had strong presidential prospects before his escapades. But she messed up when she decided to embrace Donald Trump -- rather than keeping him at arm's length -- providing further proof that even the most talented Republicans were willing to bend the knee to the former president.   Though she released a video on Tuesday announcing her intention to run against Trump for president in 2024, Haley has lost the moral high ground she once had over him.   To be clear, Haley never really had the moral high ground; she just created the illusion of having it. She is as politically ambitious as any man or woman who has considered themselves qualified enough to lead the world's most powerful nation. However, her principles have often seemed an afterthought or conditional on circumstance.    And despite Haley's ambitions, former President Donald Trump is still the top contender for the nomination. His most loyal supporters, which still number in the millions, won't abandon him just because of a loss in 2020 -- which many of them falsely believe was stolen from him -- and a bad 2022 midterm cycle for Trump-backed candidates.    But if, for some reason, he stumbles or gets embroiled in too many legal battles, Haley should be considered a serious contender. After all, you don't get elected twice as governor of Deep South, Bible Belt South Carolina as a woman with dark skin and a Sikh background by happenstance.   And though Haley's embrace of Trumpism was undoubtedly a mistake, there were early indications from her time as governor that her priority was not always the people of South Carolina, but her own political aspirations.    In 2013, then-Gov. Haley and a Republican-dominated General Assembly denied the expansion of Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act to hundreds of thousands of low-income South Carolinians. She even opposed creating a statewide health care exchange under that law.    Health officials in her administration told me at the time that there were simply better options, but it was clear to close observers in the state it was primarily about political expedience -- especially when Haley declared that she would not expand Medicaid on President Barack Obama's watch.    About 40% of the state's uninsured adults would have received health coverage under an expansion, as well as low-wage workers in retail and hospitality who are concentrated in Horry County, home to resort destination Myrtle Beach, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.   A White House study said expansion could have saved about 200 lives in the state every year through early detection and treatment. And a University of South Carolina study estimated the state could have seen an additional 44,000 jobs added by 2020 with the multibillion dollar federal investment from a Medicaid expansion.   Indeed, Haley, a self-avowed ""pro-life"" advocate, stood in the way of life-saving Obamacare -- exposing her hypocrisy on an issue that has come to define the modern-day Republican Party.    Her stance on taxes wasn't much better. Haley adhered to the tax cuts today, tax cuts tomorrow, tax cuts forever boilerplate conservative talking point while in the governor's mansion. She wanted to cut income taxes in the state, even when fellow Republicans said the cuts would be too steep.   Haley proposed a tax swap, a lowering of the top marginal income tax rate for the wealthiest South Carolinians in exchange for an increase in the gas fee that everyone pays. And she kept pushing for tax cuts even in her final budget proposal. She did not get her way often.   Of course, many of her supporters point to her handling of the Confederate flag as a sign of her sincere commitment to the people of South Carolina, and particularly the Black community.    But even that is questionable at best. The blood of Black South Carolinians had to be spilled before that flag would be removed.   After White supremacist Dylann Roof massacred innocent Black churchgoers at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston in 2015, Haley took the lead on the decision to take the Confederate battle flag off the South Carolina State House.    But for years prior to the mass shooting, Haley had dodged the issue, claiming -- falsely -- that there was no push in South Carolina for the flag to come down.   ""What I can tell you is over the last three and a half years, I spent a lot of my days on the phones with CEOs and recruiting jobs to this state,"" she said during a debate as she ran for re-election in 2014 against Democratic challenger Vincent Sheheen. ""I can honestly say I have not had one conversation with a single CEO about the Confederate flag.""   Haley had not taken any steps to get the flag lowered, or even hinted that she would try, before that ugly night in Charleston. And just a few years ago, she claimed Roof had ""hijacked"" the meaning of the flag that some South Carolinians embraced as part of a proud heritage.    Still, by making the decision to remove the flag at the time she did, Haley successfully sold the idea that she cared. That decision, paired with her actions on key GOP priorities -- from health care to taxes -- positioned her well within the party. Haley was even tasked with giving the response to President Barack Obama's State of the Union in 2016, a sign of the party's faith in her abilities and ambitions.   But when Trump first declared, Haley was an early critic. In February 2016, she said she would not endorse Trump, explaining that he is ""everything a governor doesn't want in a president."" She continued to criticize him as she campaigned with Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, whom she had endorsed for president.   Then Haley reversed course when Trump became the nominee, and she landed the type of position in his administration that would provide her with the foreign policy experience she'd need for a presidential run: US ambassador to the United Nations. She could plausibly claim to have taken the position to serve her country -- not Trump.    Her approach seemed to work. She had good standing among staunch Trump supporters but had not alienated those who considered themselves moderates and Never Trumpers when she left her position at the UN. As a South Carolina voter who had sworn off the Republican Party, I was even intrigued by what she had pulled off.   All of these strategic decisions make her a contender worth watching in the primary season. But they are also an important reminder of where so many of the leaders of the Republican Party are today -- comfortable with embracing leaders who traffic in bigotry and racism when it's beneficial in an election cycle, but equally comfortable using race and gender to protect the GOP against barbs from Democrats and others about White supremacy and misogyny.   That's precisely how Haley defended South Carolina against accusations that the flying of the flag of traitors who tried to establish a new country built on the premise of permanent black enslavement was harming the state's image. It's a heads I win-tails you lose version of identity politics.   ""But we really kind of fixed all that when you elected the first Indian-American female governor,"" Haley said during that 2014 debate in South Carolina. ""When we appointed the first African-American U.S. senator [Tim Scott], that sent a huge message.""   On that count, Haley is in a strong position. She embodies the party well. But her embrace of Trump made him look stronger and her weaker. She'll have to climb a mountain of her own making to win the nomination against him.","{'neg': 0.307, 'neu': 0.693, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.4767}",61,163.0,0.08581818181818181,0.811090909090909,0.10318181818181821,0.12919,0.072,0.783,0.145,0.999,7.88059,35.97158696969701,350.0,0.10277596277056288
Many Republicans may run for president. Most don't stand a chance,2023-02-14,"Former President Donald Trump's attempt to clear the field has officially failed. Nikki Haley -- a former member of his Cabinet who had served as US Ambassador to the United Nations and was previously governor of South Carolina -- officially announced she's running for the GOP presidential nomination with a video on Tuesday and a speech planned in her home state on Wednesday. In her announcement video, Haley emphasized her background as the child of immigrants from India who found success in South Carolina. She promised to stand up for what she sees as American values, but did not use some of the abrasive language about ""wokeness"" employed by people like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, another likely presidential candidate. Republicans have lost the popular vote in 7 of last 8 elections Haley called for a generational shift in the GOP and argued the party must reach across the aisle since Democrats have won the popular vote in seven of the last eight presidential elections. ""It's a call for the new way of thinking and presenting the Republican Party,"" CNN political director David Chalian said Tuesday. ""Her goal here is to carve out a space that is clearly not the space that Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis are currently occupying, which is really playing only to the base.""  Expect a crowded field Haley is not the only Republican candidate expected to challenge Trump. She's not even the only big-name Republican from South Carolina expected to challenge Trump. Sen. Tim Scott is also seriously considering a run. She's also not the only former Trump administration official who could challenge their old boss. Former Vice President Mike Pence has been courting social conservatives. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  recently released a memoir and is attacking President Joe Biden's foreign policy in interviews this week. Can a single-digit candidate win? Haley, Pompeo, Pence and Scott will face an uphill climb since none of them are currently particularly strong in surveys of Republican primary voters -- which suggest the majority of those voters currently either support Trump or DeSantis. CNN's Harry Enten recently wrote about how while top candidates can frequently flame out and there is precedent for a candidate with little name recognition to win the primary (and the White House!), those are the exceptions. ""While Trump or DeSantis are the odds-on favorites for the nomination, there is enough history of low-polling candidates later gaining traction to at least be open to the idea that a Haley, Pence or somebody else could, if nothing else, make things interesting come voting time,"" Enten wrote this month. Successful candidates usually have more support when they announce a campaign I asked CNN's polling editor Ariel Edwards-Levy if these candidates who jump into a presidential race at single digits in polls have any real chance of winning. She looked at pre- and post-announcement polling for each of the major party candidates since George H.W. Bush announced his candidacy in October 1987.  What she found is not good news for relative unknowns. Most winning candidates have a solid double-digit base of support among primary voters when they officially become candidates: Biden's support was nearly 40% when he announced his primary run in April 2019 in a crowded field.
Hillary Clinton's support was at 60% or more in April 2015 in a much less crowded field.
Trump had been in the single digits before his announcement in June 2015, but got an immediate bump after his controversial announcement speech and was soon hovering at around 20%.
Mitt Romney emerged from an extremely crowded field after his announcement in June 2011, but he never fell far below 20% support among primary voters.
Barack Obama announced in February 2007 to more than 20% support, somewhat more than John McCain had in April 2007, when both men faced crowded primaries. McCain turned his campaign around from the brink later in the race.
So did John Kerry, who entered the race with less than 20% support in September 2003 and caught fire after the Iowa caucuses in January 2004. 
Al Gore had strong support when he announced in June 1999 -- over 60% in most polls -- but he faced a much smaller field. George W. Bush was similarly strong then, but in a larger field of Republican candidates.
The only relatively recent example of a low-polling candidate emerging with the party's nomination is Bill Clinton, who styled himself as the ""Comeback Kid."" And that 1992 election was a special race for a number of reasons, not the least of which is Clinton ultimately won the White House in a three-way race with only a little more than 40% of the popular vote.  ""It's hard to know precisely how much predictive value to assign to these historical precedents,"" Edwards-Levy told me. ""Obviously, it's better for a candidate to start with a broad base of support than without any backing, but every election carries its own degree of idiosyncrasy. If the past few election cycles have taught us anything, it's to be modest about assuming which past principles will hold -- or break."" Who might run?  CNN's Eric Bradner has published a list of potential Republican presidential candidates and what they've said about whether they'll run. The quotes from these potential candidates range from very interested and not hiding it, to clearly interested but still being cagey, to not admitting any interest at all. Read Bradner's report, but I've done something a little different, which is to take his list of potential candidates and note their most recent memoir (most of them have one) and what it could say about their potential campaign. I've left off Trump here, since his ""The Art of the Deal"" is now decades old. DeSantis The Florida governor's memoir -- ""The Courage to Be Free: Florida's Blueprint for America's Revival"" -- is set to be released in late February.  DeSantis frequently talks about how he's standing up for freedom, often by placing restrictions on school districts and local governments. He's not afraid of being divisive, and he wants you to know it. Haley The former UN ambassador's memoir -- ""With All Due Respect: Defending America with Grit and Grace""-- suggests Haley sees no reason to be as combative as DeSantis even if she wants to appear just as committed.  While she has at times sought distance from Trump, in her memoir, she wrote about rebuffing an effort by Trump's aides to recruit her to undermine him. Pence  The former vice president's memoir -- ""So Help Me God"" -- details Pence's fractures with Trump.  The title flicks at the optional coda public servants may add to the oath of office. Pence is both invoking the importance of God to him and his politics -- he is a committed evangelical -- and pointing out he kept his oath when he refused to turn the 2020 election for Trump. Pompeo In the former secretary of state's memoir -- ""Never Give an Inch: Fighting for the America I Love"" -- Pompeo alleges that Haley plotted with Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner to try to become vice president. And the title suggests a candidate who will be dismissive of anyone who questions him. Scott Scott is the only Black Republican in the Senate, and his memoir has an inspiring story. He shorthands his family's journey as going from ""cotton to Congress."" He tells it in the memoir -- ""America, a Redemption Story: Choosing Hope, Creating Unity"" -- which also has a theme of second chances. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem  While Noem has said she's not sure she needs to run for president, she did write a memoir: ""Not My First Rodeo: Lessons from the Heartland."" Texas Sen. Ted Cruz Cruz checked the memoir box before he ran unsuccessfully for president in 2016 with, ""A Time for Truth: Reigniting the Promise of America."" Cruz has written two books since then, including a political salvo against liberals and the law: ""Justice Corrupted: How the Left Weaponized Our Legal System.""  Texas Gov. Greg Abbott It's not at all clear that Abbott will run, but he wrote a memoir in 2016 before his second run for governor: ""Broken But Unbowed: The Fight to Fix a Broken America."" Former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan Hogan's seriously considering a campaign, and his memoir suggests a middle path -- which could be compelling in a general election, but might be more difficult as a way to convince Republican primary voters. Its title: ""Still Standing: Surviving Cancer, Riots, a Global Pandemic, and the Toxic Politics that Divide America."" Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie Christie lost to Trump in the 2016 primary and was then pushed out of Trump's administration before it began.  His memoir from the Trump years, ""Let Me Finish: Trump, the Kushners, Bannon, New Jersey, and the Power of In-Your-Face Politics,"" torches Kushner. His more forward-looking recent book is, ""Republican Rescue: Saving the Party from Truth Deniers, Conspiracy Theorists, and the Dangerous Policies of Joe Biden."" Others who are viewed as potential candidates, like New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, do not appear to have memoirs at this point -- which may or may not say something about whether they will ultimately run.","{'neg': 0.182, 'neu': 0.818, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.2509}",70,164.0,0.03833333333333333,0.8668,0.09486666666666667,0.22523076923076918,0.051,0.797,0.152,0.9995,15.766153846153843,49.655240815850846,385.0,0.12897465146974246
Third Trump attorney appears before federal grand jury investigating Mar-a-Lago documents,2023-02-14,"Alina Habba, an attorney for former President Donald Trump, appeared last month before a federal grand jury investigating the mishandling of classified documents from his time in the White House, two sources familiar with the investigation told CNN. Habba is the third Trump lawyer known to have been brought before the DC-based grand jury, which is investigating obstruction in addition to criminal violations of government records laws. While Habba has not played the prominent role that other Trump attorneys have played in responding to the documents probe, which spilled out in public view with an August FBI search of Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, she has made notable TV appearances defending Trump and criticizing the federal documents probe. Habba also has been a lead attorney in litigation related to New York Attorney General Letitia James' civil case against the Trump family and their business for alleged financial fraud. In that role, she personally searched several Trump properties -- including Trump's residence and private office at Mar-a-Lago -- weeks before the FBI search. She was tasked with recovering any Trump Organization documents that James was seeking but told a New York court she didn't find any records covered by the subpoena from the attorney general.   Habba's spokesperson declined to comment on her recent appearance in the federal documents probe. Since Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith has taken over the federal investigation, it has taken significant steps. Trump attorneys Evan Corcoran and Christina Bobb recently appeared before the grand jury as well, CNN reported last week. Corcoran was in contact with federal officials as the efforts to retrieve and scrutinize the documents in question ramped up last year. He also drafted a statement -- ultimately signed by Bobb in June -- asserting that Trump's representatives had complied with a subpoena for documents marked as classified that remained at his Mar-a-Lago resort. In the weeks after, the FBI came to believe that other classified documents were still at Mar-a-Lago and executed a search warrant in August.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.769, 'pos': 0.231, 'compound': 0.4588}",12,165.0,0.0645,0.8865000000000001,0.049,-0.18867999999999996,0.042,0.898,0.06,0.8893,-2.2641599999999995,41.61164748251752,380.0,0.10950433548030926
Adam Frisch announces 2024 campaign after losing to Rep. Lauren Boebert in one of the closest races in 2022,2023-02-14,"Adam Frisch, who narrowly lost to GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert in one of the closest races of the 2022 cycle, announced Tuesday that he will run again in 2024, potentially setting up a high-profile rematch. ""I. AM. RUNNING. You heard it here first! I am officially launching my campaign to unseat Lauren Boebert and restore dignity to #CO03 representation. We lost by a mere 546 votes in '22 -- the closest race in the country -- and know we can make that up in '24,"" the Democrat tweeted.  Boebert has represented Colorado's 3rd Congressional District since 2020. And the seat, which former President Donald Trump would've won by nearly 8 percentage points in 2020, became more Republican after redistricting. She has not announced a reelection bid. Boebert's office did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. Frisch's stronger-than-expected performance in 2022 caused the race to emerge as one of the most closely watched contests, with Frisch conceding days after the election.  Despite conceding, there was an automatic recount done by the Colorado secretary of state's office. In Colorado, any race decided by a margin that's 0.5% or less of the votes earned by the top finisher is automatically recounted.  Boebert received 50.06% of the final vote total, while Frisch received 49.89% after the recount.  Boebert, a political newcomer in 2020, upset Rep. Scott Tipton in a GOP primary that year. She found meaningful support in Colorado by positioning herself as a close ally of Trump. The Republican recently received a spot on the House Oversight Committee and helped House Speaker Kevin McCarthy win the speakership by voting ""present"" after voting against McCarthy in several ballots.

Ted Cruz to seek reelection to Senate in 2024,2023-02-14,"Sen. Ted Cruz told reporters on Tuesday that he will run for a third term in the Senate in 2024 -- an assertion that suggests the Texas Republican is not planning a presidential bid.   While Texas law allows a candidate to run for Senate and president at the same time, Cruz said this when asked if he were running for reelection or would mount another bid at the White House: ""I'm running for reelection to the Senate."" Cruz had run for president in 2016 but fell short to former President Donald Trump during a bitter primary contest. But ahead of 2024, Cruz has instead been taking to steps to build a reelection bid, telling his supporters that he expects Democrats to pour huge sums of cash to try to unseat him. But as Cruz prepares to run again for Senate, the 2024 Republican presidential field is now starting to take shape. Former South Carolina Republican Gov. Nikki Haley announced earlier in the day in a video that she will run for president in 2024, becoming the first major rival to challenge Trump for the GOP nomination.  Cruz has hinted before that he hopes to launch another White House bid at some point in the future.  ""Look, I hope to run again,"" the Texas Republican told The Christian Science Monitor in 2019. ""We came very, very close in 2016.

"Trump must pay $110,000 in sanctions to NY attorney general, court rules",2023-02-14,"A New York appeals court upheld sanctions against former President Donald Trump totaling $110,000 for failing to respond to a New York state attorney general subpoena for documents. Trump appealed an order from New York state Judge Arthur Engoron, who last year ordered Trump be sanctioned $10,000 per day for failing to comply with a December 2021 subpoena as part of the state's investigation into the Trump Organization's finances. Trump appealed the order last year.  In a brief decision Tuesday, a panel of three judges said the financial sanction ""was a proper exercise of the court's discretionary power and was not excessive or otherwise improper, under the particular circumstances."" The sanction was the first -- of what turned out to be many -- facing Trump, or his attorneys, from judges. ""Once again, the courts have ruled that Donald Trump is not above the law. For years, he tried to stall and thwart our lawful investigation into his financial dealings, but today's decision sends a clear message that there are consequences for abusing the legal system. We will not be bullied or dissuaded from pursuing justice,"" said New York Attorney General Letitia James. The Trump Organization could not immediately be reached for comment. The attorney general's office asked for sanctions after months of delay. Trump's attorney, Alina Habba, said at the time that they had searched and found no documents to provide investigators other than the 10 previously turned over by the Trump Organization.  Engoron called it a ""boilerplate"" response and said the attorney failed to address whether Trump's team had searched file cabinets, calendars and other records. In the written order, Engoron wrote that Trump ""willfully disobeyed"" his prior order to comply with the subpoena for documents, and said that the former president's failure to comply harmed the civil investigation being conducted by James. The contempt finding was later lifted after Trump signed an affidavit stating he no longer had cell phones and had authorized his attorneys to search his properties. The attorneys subsequently signed affidavits describing their searches and attempts to reach Trump's former assistants. James sued Trump, his three eldest children and the Trump Organization in September alleging they engaged in a decade long fraud and mislead lenders, insurers and others for their personal gain. The Trumps have denied any wrongdoing and said the investigation is politically motivated.","{'neg': 0.113, 'neu': 0.887, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.1027}",17,168.0,0.08815384615384615,0.8799230769230769,0.032,-0.30032000000000003,0.109,0.837,0.053,-0.9753,-5.105440000000001,15.397453846153875,125.0,0.123179630769231
Pence to fight subpoena from special counsel investigating Trump in January 6 investigation,2023-02-14,"Former Vice President Mike Pence is expected to fight a recent subpoena from the special counsel investigating former President Donald Trump's post-2020 election activities based on the grounds that he was president of the Senate at the time and therefore shielded from the order, sources familiar with the matter tell CNN.  Pence is expected to address the subpoena and his response to it during a trip to Iowa on Wednesday, according to a source familiar with his plans. His decision to fight the subpoena comes as the former vice president is mulling a 2024 presidential bid.   Pence has been subpoenaed by Jack Smith, the special counsel investigating Trump and his role in January 6, 2021, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. Smith's office is seeking documents and testimony, the source said. Investigators want the former vice president to testify about his interactions with Trump leading up to the 2020 election and the day of the attack on the US Capitol. Pence's decision to fight the subpoena is likely to drag out his legal entanglements, something that many advisers had hoped would be cleared up by the time he announced his likely bid for president.  However, the move could allow for Pence to avoid the optics of willingly participating in an investigation into his former boss at the hands of the Department of Justice, which Republicans have sought to paint as politicized. The decision could also help the former vice president avoid being pitted against Trump once again, after a lawyer for the former president confirmed Sunday that Trump intends to assert executive privilege in an effort to limit any Pence testimony, a source close to Pence noted. Pence has often worked to downplay the tension between he and the former president as he inches towards a presidential run against his former boss, including largely defending Trump and touting the administration's achievements in his new memoir.  Pence's team, according to a source, had previously indicated to the Justice Department that he'd be open to answering questions if they were limited to the matters he had previously discussed publicly, including in his book. The subpoena marks an important milestone in the Justice Department's two-year criminal investigation, now led by the special counsel, into the efforts by Trump and allies to impede the transfer of power after he lost the 2020 election. Pence is an important witness who has detailed in a memoir some of his interactions with Trump in the weeks after the election, a move that likely opens the door for the Justice Department to override at least some of Trump's claims of executive privilege. Pence's intentions to resist the subpoena were first reported by Politico. The prospect of Pence fighting the special counsel's subpoena in court comes as several other witnesses in the Justice Department's investigations encircling Trump are already in secret legal battles over DOJ's demands for information from them. Those legal battles have played out under seal, keeping out of view the details of what exactly the department is seeking from members of Trump's inner circle and what arguments are being made for withholding that information. It is unclear how much will be made publicly known about the circumstances of Pence's dispute with the special counsel over the subpoena -- beyond the response Pence is expected to issue Tuesday.  Pence is expected to make arguments raising the Constitution's Speech or Debate Clause, according to a source. The clause protects legislators from certain law enforcement actions if the conduct in question is related to their legislative duties. Lawmakers have tried to use the Speech or Debate Clause to resist participating in the House investigation into the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol. Sen. Lindsey Graham also invoked the clause to challenge a subpoena in the Fulton County, Atlanta, investigation into 2020 election meddling, but the South Carolina Republican was ultimately ordered by courts to appear for testimony in that probe. Among the sealed proceedings related to the Justice Department's investigations is a secret dispute with Rep. Scott Perry, concerning information DOJ is seeking from the Pennsylvania Republican's phone, where Perry is also raising Speech or Debate Clause claims. That case is currently before the DC Circuit US Court of Appeals.  This story has been updated with additional details.

Nikki Haley announces 2024 White House bid,2023-02-14,"Former South Carolina Republican Gov. Nikki Haley announced Tuesday in a video that she will run for president in 2024, becoming the first major rival to challenge former President Donald Trump for the GOP nomination. ""The Washington establishment has failed us over and over and over again. It's time for a new generation of leadership to rediscover fiscal responsibility, secure our border and strengthen our country, our pride and our purpose,"" Haley, who is expected to deliver remarks Wednesday in Charleston at a campaign launch event, said in the video. Haley served as US ambassador to the United Nations under Trump. The former president, who announced his bid last year, recently appeared to bless her entrance into the race, telling reporters that she had called to tell him she was considering a campaign launch and that he had said, ""You should do it."" Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants, opened the video talking about how she felt ""different"" growing up in Bamberg, South Carolina. ""The railroad tracks divided the town by race. I was the proud daughter of Indian immigrants. Not Black, not White. I was different. But my mom would always say your job is not to focus on the differences but the similarities. And my parents reminded me and my siblings every day how blessed we were to live in America,"" Haley said. If successful in the primary, Haley would be the first woman and the first Asian American nominated by the Republican Party for president.  A former president of the National Association of Women Business Owners, she was first elected to the South Carolina House in 2004. Six years later, she became the first woman elected as governor of the state in 2010 and was the youngest governor in the nation when she took office in 2011. She resigned in the middle of her second term to become Trump's ambassador to the UN -- a role she served in until the end of 2018. During her video announcement, Haley touted her record as a twice-elected governor of South Carolina and her leadership in the state after nine people were fatally shot at a historically Black church in Charleston in 2015. After the shooting, Haley called for the removal of the Confederate flag from the grounds of the Statehouse. She also leaned into her foreign policy experience in her announcement and referenced her time as UN ambassador, saying she has ""seen evil."" ""Some look at our past as evidence that America's founding principles are bad. They say the promise of freedom is just made up. Some think our ideas are not just wrong, but racist and evil. Nothing could be further from the truth,"" Haley said. ""I have seen evil. In China they commit genocide. In Iran they murder their own people for challenging the government. And when a woman tells you about watching soldiers throw her baby into a fire it puts things into perspective. Even on our worst day, we are blessed to live in America."" ""Some people look at America and see vulnerability,"" Haley said. ""The socialist left sees an opportunity to rewrite history. China and Russia are on the march. They all think we can be bullied, kicked around. You should know this about me: I don't put up with bullies and when you kick back it hurts them more if you're wearing heels."" Haley will likely face stiff competition in this lane from other potential GOP candidates such as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former Vice President Mike Pence and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who are all said to be weighing 2024 runs and could also appeal to conservative Republicans looking to turn the page from Trump. Some Republican strategists say a big Republican primary field would be advantageous to Trump, who still enjoys significant support among the party base, and could splinter the vote, allowing the former president to walk away with the nomination. Haley has often attempted to walk a fine line between allying with Trump and distancing herself enough to appeal to his more moderate critics. She left the Trump administration in 2018 on good terms with the then-president -- a marked contrast from other former Trump officials who have publicly fallen out with their onetime boss. Trump on Tuesday weighed in on Haley's announcement, saying in a statement to CNN, ""Even though Nikki Haley said, 'I would never run against my President, he was a great President, the best President in my lifetime,' I told her she should follow her heart and do what she wants to do. I wish her luck!"" Trump was inaccurately referencing a statement Haley made in April 2021 when she said she ""would not run if President Trump ran,"" a sentiment she later walked back as she called for a new generation of leadership. While Trump said publicly Tuesday that he wished Haley luck, he has privately expressed annoyance that the woman he once tapped to serve as his ambassador to the United Nations would challenge him. But Trump has remained the most anxious about another challenger: DeSantis. In recent weeks, Trump has asked multiple advisers about creating a new disparaging nickname for his potential rival, privately suggesting that he target DeSantis's weight instead of referring to him as ""Ron Desanctimonious."" As Trump has vented about Haley's run, some advisers have reminded him how it could benefit him if he faces multiple Republican challenges in the race.  South Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace, who was endorsed by Haley when Trump supported her Republican opponent, told CNN Tuesday she was also worried about the size of the primary field.   ""I have concerns if there are too many people on the ballot by the time it gets to South Carolina that it lessens the chances of anyone else coming out in this thing,"" Mace said.  Haley filed to run for president with the Federal Election Commission on Tuesday.  This story has been updated with additional details.

Trump's fate in 2024 may rest on whether he can repeat his biggest surprise from 2016,2023-02-14,"Donald Trump's fate in the 2024 GOP presidential race may pivot on whether he can retain the surprisingly broad support he secured in 2016 from an unexpected group of Republican voters. Probably the biggest surprise in Trump's march to the GOP nomination in 2016 was the large number of votes he attracted among White evangelical Christians, who many analysts expected to resist a twice-divorced New Yorker who had earlier expressed support for abortion rights.  The key to that breakthrough was Trump's success in carving a new fault line in the GOP primary electorate. Traditionally, a critical divide among Republican voters has been between those who identify as evangelical Christians and those who do not.  But Trump in 2016 split the GOP electorate more along lines of education, drawing commanding support from voters without a four-year college degree, whether or not they identified as evangelical Christians. Trump's big margins among those non-college evangelicals proved critical in allowing him to win a series of culturally conservative states, especially across the South, that Sen. Ted Cruz, Trump's principal rival on the right in 2016, had expected to propel him to the nomination. If anything, those blue-collar evangelical Christians may be even more important to Trump's prospects in 2024.  Early 2024 GOP presidential preference polls suggest Trump's position may be even weaker than in 2016 among Republicans holding a four-year college degree, including both those who identify as evangelical Christians and those who do not. Those skeptical attitudes mean that to hold off the challenge that may develop from Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, among others in a field of uncertain size, Trump likely will need to maximize his support among the non-college Republicans who have always comprised his most ardent backers. And in many Republican primaries, a substantial portion, sometimes a majority, of those non-college GOP voters identify as evangelical Christians. With some prominent evangelical figures joining other GOP leaders in openly suggesting the party should move on from Trump in 2024, the former president will find it difficult to build a winning primary coalition if he cannot replicate the elevated level of blue-collar evangelical support he achieved in his stunning race to the nomination in 2016. Evangelical White Protestants have been steadily shrinking in society overall: in results to be released later this month, the non-partisan Public Religion Research Institute will place them at just under one-seventh of the adult population, down from nearly one-fourth in 2006. But they remain a much more significant component of the GOP coalition. In PRRI's data, just under one-third of Republican partisans identify as evangelical Christians. In a recent poll conducted for The Bulwark, a conservative website, veteran GOP pollster Whit Ayres projected White evangelicals as almost two-fifths of the likely 2024 GOP primary electorate. The exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN found that White evangelical or born-again voters comprised just over half of GOP primary voters in 2016 -- with non-White evangelicals contributing another few percentage points, according to a cumulative analysis of the 2016 exit polls by CNN polling director Jennifer Agiesta. (That cumulative analysis found evangelicals to be a larger share of the GOP vote than those other sources likely for two reasons: first, because it asks voters whether they consider themselves evangelical or ""born again,"" which captures a few points of Catholics who identify as born again, and second, because the competitive primary states in which exit polls were conducted in 2016 leaned more heavily toward the South than other regions where evangelicals are less plentiful, such as the Mountain West and Pacific Coast.)  The gap between voters who identify as evangelical Christians and those who do not had proven the most important dynamic in the two contested GOP presidential primaries immediately before Trump's win in 2016.  Both the 2008 and 2012 GOP presidential primaries ultimately resolved into a contest between one candidate who relied primarily on support from evangelical Christians (Mike Huckabee in 2008 and Rick Santorum in 2012) and one who depended mostly on non-evangelicals (John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012). Each time the non-evangelical candidate won the nomination with an almost identical pattern of support: both McCain in 2008 and Romney in 2012 won about half of the non-evangelical GOP primary voters, which allowed them to prevail despite winning only about one-third of those who did identify as evangelicals, according to cumulative analyses of the exit polls in those years conducted by Gary Langer of ABC News. Education had started to emerge as an important dividing line in those earlier races: Romney, for instance, had won college-educated voters in more states than he carried non-college voters. But at the key moments in those earlier contests, whether voters were evangelicals or not remained the most important variable. In the decisive 2008 South Carolina primary, for instance, McCain won a much higher share of voters who were not evangelicals than those who were, and there were only minimal differences between those with and without college degrees in each group. In the 2012 South Carolina primary, the evangelical divide was again much more powerful than the educational divide in shaping the support for Romney, Santorum and Newt Gingrich, the three principal contenders. Trump reset that axis in 2016. He made education the most important factor among voters in the race. That educational fault line rumbled through almost all states, and almost all key constituencies, including evangelical Christians. The dynamic of education levels supplanting evangelical affiliation as the principal separation among Republican voters was ""unique to Trump,"" says Jim Guth, a political scientist at Furman University in South Carolina. ""You don't find that kind of division generally for Republican candidates."" While McCain and Romney had been very strong among voters who were not evangelicals and quite weak among evangelicals, Trump's support didn't diverge as much between those poles. Instead, through the key 2016 contests, Trump consistently ran much better among voters without a four-year college degree than among those with one, whether or not they were evangelicals.  That allowed Trump in 2016 to neutralize Cruz' expected edge among evangelicals because those without degrees voted more like other blue-collar Republicans than they did like the white-collar evangelicals. Among Republican voters, said Ayres, the GOP pollster, ""the education divide"" has been ""a better predictor of Donald Trump's strength than the evangelical/non-evangelical divide."" Most important was how that pattern played out in South Carolina -- the state that has voted for the eventual winner in every GOP primary since 1980 except once (in 2012 when Gingrich unexpectedly carried the state.) Because evangelicals are such a large share of the vote there, it was critical to Cruz' hopes of stopping Trump. But Trump won it comfortably even though the exit polls found he carried only 22% of college-educated evangelicals there; the principal reason was that he won twice as high a percentage among evangelicals without a degree (44%), an even greater share than he won among non-college voters who were not evangelicals, according to exit polls. Even after Trump's victory in South Carolina, Cruz's campaign said publicly that they expected to revive by beating the New Yorker across the upcoming slate of Southern contests where evangelical Christians typically comprise a majority of GOP primary voters. Instead, exit polls found that Trump beat Cruz among non-college White evangelicals in Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee and Virginia as well as Michigan and tied him with those voters in Arkansas and Missouri. That strength was critical to Trump capturing all of those states and ultimately winning the nomination fairly easily. Across all the contested states in 2016, Trump won only 32% of all evangelicals with a college degree, according to Agiesta's cumulative analysis of the 2016 exit polls. But Trump carried 45% of all evangelicals without a degree. That was enough to provide Trump a narrow plurality of the total White evangelical vote, ""to the surprise of almost everyone,"" as the veteran Republican evangelical strategist Ralph Reed recently observed. Combined with Trump's strong support among non-evangelicals without a degree, that was enough to power him to a convincing win, despite his consistent weakness among college-educated Republican voters (whether or not they identified as evangelicals). Early indications are that education will remain a critical fault line in the 2024 GOP race, including among evangelical voters. Ayres said that in the recent 2024 polling he conducted for The Bulwark, Trump ran about even with DeSantis among non-college evangelicals when the two were matched with a large field of potential contenders, while DeSantis led the former president fairly comfortably among both college-educated evangelicals and non-evangelicals with and without a degree. Echelon Insights, another Republican polling firm, cumulated the results for me from their 2024 GOP primary polls from November through January. That polling found Trump, when placed in a large field, still drawing nearly half of the non-college White evangelicals (and comfortably leading DeSantis with them, a better showing than Ayres found). But the firm found Trump winning only about one-fourth of the college-educated evangelicals and trailing DeSantis among them. In a two-way match up, Trump drew about three-fifths of the non-college evangelicals, while DeSantis attracted a mirror image of about three-fifths of the college educated evangelicals, according to Nolan Combs, the firm's research director. PRRI recently found that Trump's favorability rating was a striking 17 percentage points higher among the non-college White Republican evangelicals than among those with a degree.  PRRI's studies have found that nearly three-fourths of the total White evangelical Protestant population lacks a college degree; because college educated voters turn out in bigger numbers, the balance is somewhat closer in the GOP primary, with the non-college side representing around 55% of the total White evangelical vote, according to the exit poll analysis. Still, evangelicals without a degree represent a larger block of Republican primary voters than either evangelicals with a degree, or non-evangelicals with or without one, the exit poll analysis found. That means that for all of Trump's other challenges, they would provide him a formidable base -- if he can hold them. Can he?

Opinion: Trump's first challenger is the one GOP needs,2023-02-02,"Nikki R. Haley, the former United States ambassador to the United Nations and former South Carolina governor, announced her 2024 presidential bid in a video on Tuesday. Haley, whose camp has been distributing invitations to a ""special announcement"" set for February 15 in Charleston, South Carolina, is the first Republican to officially declare a challenge against former President Donald Trump for the 2024 Republican nomination.  As someone who has worked for both Haley and Trump, I believe Haley is exactly the right candidate for the Republican Party at this moment -- and fellow Republicans should think twice before underestimating her.  Haley was an unknown in 2004 when she took on and defeated the longest serving Republican in the South Carolina House of Representatives by running a grassroots campaign that positioned her as an energetic and fresh-faced underdog.  Her star rose quickly as the majority whip in the South Carolina General Assembly, and she jumped into the South Carolina gubernatorial race in 2009.  In the good ole' boys club that is South Carolina politics, Haley wasn't taken seriously as a gubernatorial candidate by many until former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee, Sarah Palin, visited the Palmetto State in May 2010 and endorsed her.  Palin, who also appeared in a campaign ad calling Haley a ""strong, pro-family, pro-life, pro-second amendment, pro-development, conservative reformer"" helped boost Haley's campaign, which went from being on life-support to frontrunner-status in a field of all White male opponents.  Haley shocked the political establishment in South Carolina when she won the Republican primary just a month later. In November 2010, Haley trounced her Democratic challenger in the general election -- earning her the distinction of becoming both the first female governor of South Carolina and the second governor in the country of Indian descent.  Under Haley's leadership, South Carolina thrived. Unemployment rates fell and South Carolina's Department of Commerce announced tens of thousands of jobs had been created under her tenure and billions in capital investment flowed into the state. She also spearheaded efforts to pass a law that added transparency to the legislative process and required South Carolina lawmakers to vote on the record more frequently. In the aftermath of the 2015 mass-shooting at Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, Haley worked tirelessly to unify our state and successfully led the efforts to remove the Confederate Flag from the South Carolina State House grounds.  Later that year, she was calm and composed leading the state when Hurricane Matthew made landfall and historic floods wreaked havoc on residents of our state. Despite these accomplishments, and a very successful reelection campaign in 2014, Trump is said to have rejected Haley as a potential secretary of state, citing a ""complexion problem,"" and noting the ""blotch marks on her cheeks"" in a conversation with then-Chief of Staff John Kelly, according to the book ""The Divider,"" by New Yorker writer Susan Glasser and New York Times' Peter Baker.  He opted instead to appoint her the US ambassador to the United Nations, where she quickly became a leader in the Republican Party for her no-nonsense and direct approach to diplomacy. From cutting more than $285 million from the UN budget to leading the charge to pull out of the disgraced UN Human Rights Council, Haley quickly built a name for herself as a successful US diplomat who got things done. When she resigned in 2018, she was one of the few Trump administration officials to stay in the good graces of the former president, with the New York Times editorial page praising Haley as ""that rarest of Trump appointees: one who can exit the administration with her dignity largely intact.""  But Haley's relationship with Trump has grown more complicated since she left the administration. She spoke out against him after the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol before changing her tune in October 2021, telling the Wall Street Journal, ""We need him in the Republican Party. I don't want us to go back to the days before Trump.""  And when the news broke that she was expected to announce a run for president, Trump took a shot at her by sharing a video of Haley from April 2021, when she said she would ""not run if President Trump ran"" in 2024. When Fox News host Bret Baier brought up those same comments last month, Haley responded by calling for generational change, citing issues like inflation and crime and saying, ""A lot has changed.""  Ultimately, a dust-up between the former president and any Republican challenger is inevitable. What matters is that Haley is a formidable candidate who brings the executive experience from her days as governor as well as the foreign policy experience from her time as ambassador. This experience, paired with her ability to bring people together, her background as a mom and a military spouse, and her track record of fighting the uphill battle of running against old white men -- is exactly why she is the right candidate, at the right moment, for Republicans to rally behind as we look to win back the White House in 2024.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.842, 'pos': 0.158, 'compound': 0.128}",24,172.0,0.039,0.888,0.073,0.2699833333333334,0.04,0.884,0.076,0.9653,6.479600000000001,39.68516119047622,162.0,0.24497013080540878

Another unidentified object was shot down over northern Canada on Saturday, marking the third time in a week that US fighter jets have taken down objects in North American airspace. On Friday, an unidentified object was shot down in Alaska airspace by a US F-22. And last weekend, a Chinese surveillance balloon was taken down by F-22s off the coast of South Carolina. That marks the beginning and the end of what we know definitively. Here's everything we still don't know, and some of the things we do.  Are the latest objects related to China's spy balloon? There's no indication at this point whether the unidentified objects have any connection to China's surveillance balloon. Canadian retired Maj. Gen. Scott Clancy, former director of operations at NORAD and former deputy commander of the Alaskan NORAD Region, said on Monday he does not believe China is behind the unidentified objects that have been shot down in recent days. He explained that it could be a ""confluence of a distinctive activity by our adversaries to test the systems."" ""It smells to me, as the guy who was directed to conduct operations to defend North America, I'd be very suspicious,"" Clancy said on ""CNN This Morning."" ""And I'd be on high alert to make sure that all of our adversaries are being countered."" Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense and Hemispheric Affairs, Melissa Dalton told reporters on Sunday they were taken down out of an ""abundance of caution."" Dalton said that high-altitude objects can be used by a range of companies, countries, and research organizations for ""purposes that are not nefarious, including legitimate research."" ""The spy balloon from the PRC was of course different in that we knew precisely what was,"" she said. ""These most recent objects do not pose a kinetic military threat, but their path in proximity to sensitive DoD sites, and the altitude that they were flying could be a hazard to civilian aviation and thus raised concerns."" Are these all balloons? It's still unclear, but we're not dealing with aliens. During a midday briefing on Monday, the White House offered one detail of certainty: the objects did not originate from outer space. ""I just wanted to make sure we address this from the White House: I know there have been questions and concerns about this but there is no -- again, no -- indication of aliens or extraterrestrial activity with these recent take-downs,"" press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. A US official told CNN there has been caution inside the Biden administration on the pilot descriptions of the unidentified objects shot down over Alaska and Canada due to the circumstances in which the objects were viewed. But at least two high-ranking officials have made reference to balloons.  Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told ABC News that he was briefed on the object by White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan and that the object shot down over Canada was likely another balloon -- as was the high-altitude object downed over Alaska on Friday. Canada's chief of defense staff, Gen. Wayne Eyre, also made mention of a ""balloon"" when describing instructions given to the team that worked to take down the object. A Pentagon memo sent to lawmakers and obtained by CNN said the object shot down over Canada appeared to be a ""small, metallic balloon with a tethered payload below it.""  The object crossed near ""US sensitive sites"" before it was shot down, the Monday memo said.  Still, deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh noted Sunday ""these objects shot down on Friday and Saturday were objects and did not closely resemble the PRC balloon. When we can recover the debris, we will have more for you."" Why are these objects being spotted now? Notably, the US intelligence community's method to track China's fleet of surveillance balloons was only discovered within the last year, six people familiar with the matter told CNN.  The findings have allowed the US to develop a consistent technical method for the first time, which they have used to track the balloons in near-real time across the globe, the sources said. The revelation that the intelligence community only within the last year developed a reliable way to track China's balloon fleet -- which officials now say has flown dozens of missions worldwide -- helps explain why Trump administration officials have stridently claimed to have had no knowledge of the three alleged flights over US territory during the former president's time in office. In other words, it's possible that it's not so much the objects that are new, but our ability to track them.  And, as CNN's Natasha Bertrand reported Sunday, NORAD command recently readjusted its filters to better spot slow-moving targets operating above a certain altitude.  ""In light of the People's Republic of China balloon that we took down last Saturday, we have been more closely scrutinizing our airspace at these altitudes, including enhancing our radar, which may at least partly explain the increase in objects that we detected over the past week,"" Dalton said. China has accused the US of ""illegally"" flying high-altitude balloons into its airspace more than 10 times since January 2022. The White House responded to those claims by saying the allegation is false. ""Any claim that the US government operates surveillance balloons over the PRC is false. It is China that has a high-altitude surveillance balloon program for intelligence collection, that it has used to violate the sovereignty of the US and over 40 countries across 5 continents,"" a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, Adrienne Watson, wrote on Twitter.  How large is the Chinese surveillance operation? It's still unclear, but it appears to be quite large. Since news broke last week about the Chinese balloon that was floating over US airspace, new details have emerged about what's now understood to be a global surveillance operation by China's military, the People's Liberation Army. On Thursday, officials revealed that they believe the spy balloons the US has discovered are part of a large fleet that is conducting surveillance operations globally. The US has traced the balloons to 40 countries across five continents. Lt. Gen. Alexus Grynkewich, the commander of US Air Forces Central, said on Monday Chinese surveillance balloons have been spotted in the Middle East over the last few years. The balloons didn't fly over Americans bases, Grynkewich said, recalling the latest instance in which a balloon ""primarily stayed out over the water.""  Was the object shot down on Sunday like the others? A US F-16 fighter jet shot down the latest airborne object over Lake Huron on Sunday afternoon at the direction of President Joe Biden, the Pentagon said. ""We did not assess it to be a kinetic military threat to anything on the ground, but assess it was a safety flight hazard and a threat due to its potential surveillance capabilities. Our team will now work to recover the object in an effort to learn more,"" Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said. The object was flying at 20,000 feet over Michigan's Upper Peninsula, a senior administration official told CNN on Sunday. It was ""octagonal"" with strings hanging off and no discernible payload, according to the official and another source briefed on the matter. CNN reported earlier that Rep. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan said she received a call from the Department of Defense saying the US military ""has an extremely close eye"" on an object above Lake Huron.  ""Just got a call from @DeptofDefense — our military has an extremely close eye on the object above Lake Huron,"" Slotkin said in a tweet on Sunday. ""We'll know more about what this was in the coming days, but for now, be assured that all parties have been laser-focused on it from the moment it traversed our waters."" Unanswered questions Lawmakers on Capitol Hill want answers. All senators will get a classified briefing Wednesday on China, according to a Senate aide.  This comes after politicians on both sides of the aisle met the news of more objects being shot down with a range of responses Sunday. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner told CNN that the Biden administration does appear ""somewhat trigger-happy, although this is certainly preferable to the permissive environment that they showed when the Chinese spy balloon was coming over some of our most sensitive sites."" ""What I think this shows, which is probably more important to our policy discussion here, is that we really have to declare that we're going to defend our airspace. And then we need to invest,"" the Ohio Republican said. ""This shows some of the problems and gaps that we have. We need to fill those as soon as possible because we certainly now ascertain there is a threat."" Turner's Democratic counterpart on the Intelligence panel, Connecticut Rep. Jim Himes, told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that he had ""real concerns about why the administration is not being more forthcoming with everything that it knows,"" before adding, ""My guess is that there's just not a lot of information out there to share."" Schumer, meanwhile, said Congress needs to investigate why it took so long for the US to catch on to the Chinese government's use of spy balloons. ""I do think (Democratic Sen. Jon) Tester is looking into why it took so long for us, our military, our intelligence, to know about these balloons. That's something I support. Congress should look at that. That's the question we have to answer,"" he said. ""I think our military, our intelligence are doing a great job, present and future. I feel a lot of confidence in what they're doing. But why, as far back as the Trump administration, did no one know about this?"" Anita Anand, the Canadian defense minister, said on ""CNN This Morning"" Monday she is ""in regular contact"" with US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin after a high-altitude object was shot down over the Yukon on Saturday. When asked if they plan to make the visuals public, Anand said they plan to be ""fully transparent,"" but did not commit specifically to release visuals. She added the investigation could take some time due to the fact that the debris hasn't been located yet and fell in a ""very remote"" part of the Yukon territory.  This story has been updated with additional details.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",77,173.0,0.1005,0.8554999999999999,0.044,0.06040000000000001,0.029,0.908,0.063,0.9955,4.6508,49.44140119047622,222.0,0.2227090143715145
The US now faces simultaneous showdowns with China and Russia,2023-02-14,"Fighting one Cold War was bad enough. Waging two at once would be impossible. Two years into Joe Biden's presidency, the United States now faces simultaneous diplomatic and national security crises with its 20th century superpower rival Moscow and its top 21st century adversary China. The war in Ukraine, about to reach a blood-soaked first anniversary, and a spy balloon drama that has provided a first tangible symbol for many Americans of an emerging challenge from Beijing, are creating a tense moment in global geopolitics. This revived era of great power rivalry -- that would have seemed a distant prospect in the previous two decades consumed by the war on terror and Middle East wars -- underscore the great burdens and responsibilities resting on a president whose worldview was framed after he came to Washington in the 1970s amid the US-Soviet chill  This dangerous period will be crystalized this weekend when Western foreign policy officials and experts gather for the annual Munich Security Conference, which is set to be dominated by the deepening war in Ukraine. But the event will also become a stage for the rivalry between the United States and China with both Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Chinese top diplomat Wang Yi in town. The State Department says no meetings are planned as details emerge about China's global balloon spying program and accusations fly back and forth across the Pacific. The double diplomatic crisis has also exposed the way that Washington's bitterly polarized politics could influence US policy overseas and the political capital every administration needs to pursue its aims. Fervent Republican criticism of Biden's failure to shoot down a Chinese surveillance balloon before it traversed the continent followed by claims that he's trigger happy in downing subsequent unknown aerial objects, show that for many in the GOP -- critical geopolitics are just another excuse for partisan score settling.  Biden may have played into this by not speaking publicly to Americans about a trio of incidents in which jets were scrambled over the weekend. But more broadly, the Republican Party's abdication of the internationalist principles that won the Cold War against the Soviet Union, its splits over funding for Ukraine and the possibility of another White House term for Donald Trump who turned US foreign policy into a mirror of his own volatile temperament raise even more questions as the 2024 election looms.  How clashes with Russia and China differ -- and are similar  Many foreign policy experts might disdain the loaded term Cold War in relation to the current showdowns with Moscow or Beijing. The US is not locked for instance in the global ideological, economic and political tussle with Russia like it was with its predecessor, the Soviet Union, from the late 1940s to the end of the 1980s. By any measure apart from nuclear weapons, the US is far more powerful than Russia. The war in Ukraine and a series of disastrous battlefield defeats have meanwhile exposed the myth of Russian super power strength -- even if that post-Soviet nuclear arsenal means President Vladimir Putin can wield the threat of Armageddon to head off a direct Western intervention. There is still time, meanwhile, to avert the growing test of strength between the United States and China from turning into the kind of conflict that could plunge the world into war. And the US and Chinese economies are entwined in a way that had no parallel with the isolated, communist Soviet Union. Americans and Chinese have a huge incentive to stop their differences spilling over because both would pay an enormous economic price for any armed military clash. Yet at the same time, there is a growing sense of the world dividing into two camps between democracies and autocracies, even if Russia's attempts to trigger a generational US fear by edging closer to China may be overblown so far. The Cold War might have ended with the defeat of the Soviet Union. But it was never over in the mind of Putin, the KGB officer left high and dry in East Germany when the Berlin Wall came down and who has devoted his more than 20 Kremlin years to challenging the West and trying to restore respect for Russian power. Putin sees the Ukraine war as an attempt to regain influence over Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, to crush its sovereignty and to frustrate its aspirations of joining the Western clubs -- the European Union and NATO. His invasion of Ukraine broke the post-Cold-War territorial settlement in Europe.  While doing everything he can to avoid setting off a direct clash with Russia, Biden is now not shying away from raising the huge stakes in the war for the Western way of life that prevailed in the Cold War. He has sent billions of dollars in American weapons into a proxy conflict he defined as ""a test for the ages. A test for America, a test of the world"" in his State of the Union address last week. ""Such a defense matters to us because it keeps the peace and prevents open season for would-be aggressors to threaten our security and prosperity,"" Biden said, in remarks that also might have been aimed at nationalistic Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Defining the US tussle with China  The US standoff with China is also increasingly one about values as well as a shadow fight between two vast militaries and two nations who wish to be the top dog in the Asia-Pacific region. When the United States talks of ensuring that China keeps to a rules-based system in terms of trade, economics, territorial claims, freedom of naval navigation and military issues, leaders in Beijing perceive an attempt to constrain what they see as their country's rightful rise to power with international laws biased towards the West.  Biden, who has framed much of his foreign policy on the assumption that the key strategic question of the current century will be the challenge from Beijing, has repeatedly stressed that he wants ""competition, not conflict"" with China. But he is also adamant that the US will challenge what it sees as China's aspirations. ""The People's Republic of China is the only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to do it,"" Biden's National Security Strategy, published last October, said. ""Beijing has ambitions to create an enhanced sphere of influence in the Indo-Pacific and to become the world's leading power."" The bitter politics stirred up by America's challenges abroad  The increasingly strained global political climate is playing into American domestic politics in two notable ways. It is fueling an effort by Republicans -- seen especially in the current Chinese balloon drama -- to portray Biden as a weak commander-in-chief who is not up to global challenges ahead of his 2024 election race. This pressure in Washington appears to be narrowing the political running room that the administration has in dealing with global threats. For example, absent some sign of contrition from the Chinese, it would be a big political risk for Blinken to reschedule a trip to Beijing, which is vitally important for putting a lid on tensions, any time soon. And the way that Biden sprang into action over the weekend to shoot down three unidentified objects in North American airspace suggests political criticism of his decision to wait until the Chinese balloon had crossed the Atlantic coast to shoot it down has conditioned his decision making. The White House denies this is the case. Republican Senate Minority leader Mitch McConnell on Monday tapped into the classic Republican criticism of Democratic presidents -- an impression that they somehow are guilty of insulting America's own power with timidity and are leaving the country disrespected abroad and vulnerable to unscrupulous foreign powers. The Kentucky Republican spoke disdainfully of how Americans watched the Chinese balloon ""tour a big chunk of the country before the administration, finally belatedly shot it down."" He added: ""How did we get into a position where the greatest nation in the world doesn't know what is traversing our own airspace?"" It's already clear that an accusation Biden is weak will be at the center of the 2024 race. In an unsubtle swipe, on Monday, Trump sent out a fundraising email warning that ""our enemies can smell weakness in the White House from across the globe."" He claimed that Biden would not stand up for America and that his actions had led to the invasion of Ukraine and that the spy balloon saga was one of the ""most humiliating moments in US history."" Former US ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, who is expected to announce a run for the GOP nomination on Wednesday, released a video drawing allusions to her hawkish Reagan-era predecessor at the UN, Jeane Kirkpatrick, and former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher that styled her as a future scourge of Xi and Putin. Biden, like every president must accept criticism of his global leadership, and the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 will blot his legacy. But the Republican assaults on Biden's supposed weakness are borne from short memories. They ignore Trump's frequent genuflecting before Putin, the way he cozied up to Xi before the Covid-19 pandemic and his own self-described love affair with North Korean tyrant Kim Jong Un. The Afghan withdrawal was based on a timetable agreed to in a deal with the Taliban established by Trump. While Biden demonstrated the most assured leadership of a revived Western alliance since at least President George H. W. Bush at the end of the Cold War, the House GOP is embroiled in an internal feud over whether Ukraine is even worth defending. And the last GOP president before Trump, George W. Bush embroiled the nation in more than a decade long quagmire in Iraq and one of the worst foreign debacles since World War II, partly out of a desire to demonstrate US toughness.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",52,174.0,0.1278,0.7882,0.08399999999999999,-0.23732000000000003,0.158,0.746,0.097,-0.9992,-12.340640000000002,33.497561190476226,250.0,0.1339902447619049
"February 13, 2023 Latest on the unidentified objects shot down over North America",2023-02-13,"The first missile launched by an F-16 fighter jet at the object near Lake Huron, Michigan, on Sunday did not hit the target, three people briefed on the matter told CNN.  The Pentagon and White House had not previously disclosed that the first missile did not strike the target. But NORTHCOM and NORAD Commander Gen. Glen VanHerck told reporters on Sunday that acquiring and targeting the object was difficult because of its small size. A radar-guided missile would have a “lower probability of success” because of the small size of the object, which also made it difficult to use the aircraft’s gun to shoot it down. “The pilots in each situation felt that that was really unachievable because of the size,” VanHerck said. The pilots opted to use short-range AIM-9X Sidewinders, which are capable of seeing the heat contrast between an object and the surrounding area. But even so, the first missile failed to hit its target, sources said. It is not clear what happened to the missile. “In each case, we have taken extreme caution to ensure that we limit potential collateral damage,” VanHerck said Sunday, though he did not acknowledge the missed shot. CNN has reached out to the Pentagon for comment Fox News was the first to report that the first missile missed. A “significant” portion of the wreckage of the Chinese spy balloon has been recovered in about 50 feet of water off the coast of South Carolina, according to a defense official.  A salvage ship equipped with a crane arrived in the area on Friday and began raising debris from the sea floor as weather permitted, including some of the structure of the payload carried under the balloon and the electronics. The payload carried by the balloon weighed approximately 2,000 pounds and was the size of three school buses. The sensitive components will be handed over to the FBI for further investigation, according to the official. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said Monday that crews have collected “a fair amount of debris” from the Chinese surveillance balloon. It was shot down last weekend on February 4. The White House declined to place a timeline on further recovery efforts, especially given the variable weather conditions that have limited the ability of Navy divers to get in the water. “It could take a long time, given the sea state and weather conditions and the degree to which when we have to protect the safety of the divers,” John Kirby, the National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications, said on Monday.  ABC was first to report on the progress of the balloon recovery efforts. Lawmakers are calling on the Biden administration to divulge more information about the downed objects, saying they have received little so far. ""I think there ought to be more transparency — and I believe it can be offered in a way that protects national security and sources and methods,"" Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Monday. Sen. Gary Peters, who chairs the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said he spoke three times with Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas over the weekend along with Pentagon officials. He said he learned nothing more than what has already been reported by the news media. ""We still have questions outstanding as to what we know,"" he said. ""We'll be asking probing questions tomorrow when they come in a classified setting,"" Peters added, noting his calls over the weekend were unclassified. Democratic Sen. Jon Tester, who chairs the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, said he doesn't believe there's a protocol for how the US handles these objects and he plans to use the appropriations process to find out ""what they knew, when they knew it and what the plan is."" Senate Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Marco Rubio, a Republican, said he thinks ""the communication disclosure has been poor"" and called for President Joe Biden to address the unidentified objects. ""I think they [the American people] need to hear from the president, maybe as simple as saying 'you know, we don't know what they are, we’re doing everything we can to sort of determine, and this is why we shot them down,'” Rubio said. Republican Sen. Mitt Romney warned against getting “too excited” about balloons and unidentified objects when there are still so many questions about what they are.  ""I think we get a little hyped up over objects that don't quite understand what they are — balloons, weather balloons — and let's find out what they are before we get too excited,"" he said. Another Republican, Sen. Todd Young, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said there's ""a lot more to learn” before assessing if the shooting down of the objects was handled properly. Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, both Democrats from Virginia, have each given their take on the unidentified objects shot down over North American air space this week. Warner, the Senate Intelligence Committee chair, said he is hopeful he will get more information in Tuesday’s classified briefing on objects. “I’m not satisfied yet, I think we’re going to get more of a brief tomorrow, I’m not sure in terms of even the collection of materials, what have we found,” Warner told reporters Monday.  Warner said he has questions about how objects are identified.  “I’m trying to get an answer about whether there is an appropriate notification system,” Warner said about the unidentified objects,"" he said.  When asked if President Joe Biden should address the public on the unidentified objects, Warner said, “let’s get through tomorrow.” Kaine, who sits on the armed services and foreign relations committees, said he doesn’t think Americans should be worried in the wake of the Chinese spy balloon and unknown flying objects. ""People shouldn't be lying awake in bed worried at night,"" he said Monday.  Asked how concerned should Americans be in terms of the threat level, Kaine said, ""these are not posing dangers to civilians. Now they would have posed dangers to civilian aircraft, and that's why they were taken down ... We got to get answers, but I mean, I'm not frightened for America."" Kaine said he is supportive, so far, of the Biden administration's response: ""They've been doing a good job so far, but I do have a lot of questions."" The unidentified flying object shot down in Canadian airspace on Saturday appeared to be a ""small, metallic balloon with a tethered payload below it,"" according to a Pentagon memo sent to lawmakers on Monday and obtained by CNN.   The memo offers the first official details of one of the three objects shot down in recent days that was previously described as a ""cylindrical object."" The object crossed near ""US sensitive sites"" before it was shot down, the memo said.  Defense officials also wrote that the object shot down over Lake Huron in Michigan on Sunday, ""subsequently slowly descended"" into the water after impact.   The new details in the memo come as lawmakers on Capitol Hill are pressing to gain a better understanding of why the Biden administration shot down three unidentified objects in three days following the takedown of the Chinese spy balloon that traversed the US the previous weekend.  A US official told CNN this past weekend there has been caution inside the administration on the pilot descriptions of the unidentified objects due to the circumstances in which the objects were viewed.   ""These objects did not closely resemble and were much smaller than the PRC (People's Republic of China) balloon and we will not definitively characterize them until we can recover the debris, which we are working on,"" a National Security Council spokesperson said.  The memo said the object shot down over Alaska on Friday was the ""size of a small car"" and not similar to the Chinese balloon shot off the coast of South Carolina.  ""We have no further details about the object at this time, including the full scope of its capabilities, its purpose, or its origin,"" the Pentagon memo said. ""It should not be assumed that the events of the past few days are connected.""  John Bolton, who served as former President Donald Trump's national security adviser, will be briefed by the Biden administration about Chinese surveillance balloons on Wednesday, CNN is told. The briefing is expected to be conducted by the office of the director of national intelligence.   Former Trump Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe and Trump's other former national security adviser Robert O'Brien were also offered to be briefed Wednesday, but it remains to be seen if they will accept, according to a source. Former Pentagon chief Mark Esper was also offered a briefing that day but is working on scheduling one for a different date.  This comes after Biden officials said that they would contact some former Trump officials about briefings after the US downed a Chinese surveillance balloon and had learned that China had also sent spy balloons into US airspace while they were in office.  Some context: On Monday, National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby said the asset was part of the People's Republic of China high-altitude balloon program for intelligence gathering. Kirby said the Chinese balloon program was operating during the Trump administration, but the objects were not detected then. Senators “only have preliminary details"" about the unidentified objects shot down over North American airspace over the weekend, according to Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, but more information is expected to be shared with lawmakers at a briefing Tuesday.  Schumer, in remarks on the Senate floor Monday, commended President Joe Biden and the service members “who acted quickly to shoot these objects down before they dangered American aircraft or civilians.” “Unlike the balloon shot down last week, these objects demanded a swift response to ensure they didn't get in the way of commercial jets or pose any other risk on the ground,” he said. “The American people can rest assured that our defense and intelligence agencies are focused like a laser to determine where these objects came from, and what their capabilities were.” The New York Democrat added that Congress plans to conduct a ""bipartisan examination"" into the objects, including the Chinese spy balloon that was shot down last week. He also said he hopes to also figure out why the US didn't detect these assets sooner. The Tuesday briefing is in addition to the scheduled full-Senate classified briefing on China on Wednesday, Schumer said. House Intelligence Chairman Mike Turner called the lack of an administration briefing on the unidentified objects shot down last week over North American airspace “absolutely frustrating.”  “We’re the committee that is supposed to be receiving the intelligence that’s being generated, the notifications from the administration to Congress that are official about these types of threats, and we’re not hearing anything,” Turner said in an interview on Fox News.  There was a classified briefing for all House members last week on the Chinese spy balloon that was shot down over US waters the previous weekend.  Since then, an unidentified object was shot down in Alaska airspace on Friday. Another object was shot down over northern Canada on Saturday, and a third over Lake Huron on Sunday afternoon, the Pentagon said.  Turner said he feels that the ""administration is not being forthcoming with Congress,"" claiming that members on both sides of the aisle feel that way. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Monday that the US is still working to recover debris from three unidentified objects shot down in North American airspace over the weekend.  “We’re going to confirm what they are once we’ve collected the debris,” Austin said. “But to answer your question, we’ve not recovered any debris from the three most recent shootdowns.”  The US military shot down three unidentified objects in as many days over the weekend — two in US airspace, and one in Canadian airspace.  Recovery efforts so far: Austin said Monday that crews have collected “a fair amount of debris” from a Chinese surveillance balloon shot down on Feb. 4, but weather has impacted the search for one object’s debris in Alaska.  Near Lake Huron, Austin said, US Northern Command, the US Coast Guard, and the FBI are ”beginning operations to locate debris in close partnership with the Canadians.” Austin emphasized that the three objects shot down over the weekend “are very different” from what the US saw traverse the country last week.  “I want to be clear the three objects taken down this weekend are very different from what we were talking about last week,” he said. “We knew exactly what that was — a (People's Republic of China) PRC surveillance balloon.”  Defending Canada’s territorial integrity and sovereignty “has rarely been as important as it is now,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Monday, speaking about the aerial objects appearing in North American airspace over the last week. ""This is a very serious situation that we are taking incredibly seriously,” Trudeau said. “The actions we're taking to protect North American airspace, the actions we're taking to recover and analyze these objects, the importance of defending our territorial integrity, our sovereignty, has rarely been as important as it is now.” An unidentified object was shot down over northern Canada on Saturday, marking the third time in a week that US fighter jets have taken down objects. ""I think obviously there is some sort of pattern in there,” Trudeau added. “The fact that we are seeing this in a significant degree over the past week is a cause for interest and close attention, which is exactly what we're doing” The prime minister said Canada has sent resources to help recover the object and is working with other countries to get more information and solutions.  US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman denied claims from Beijing that the United States has flown surveillance balloons over China. “There are no US government balloons over the People’s Republic of China. None. Zero. Period,” she said at a news conference at the State Department Monday. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Monday that the US has ""illegally” flown high-altitude balloons into China’s sovereign airspace without Beijing’s consent “more than ten times” since Jan. 2022. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and China’s top diplomat Wang Yi are both expected to attend the Munich Security Conference this weekend, presenting the opportunity for the two to meet for the first time since the US downed a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon that entered American airspace. US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said Monday she was aware of a report of a potential meeting in Munich, Germany, “but I have nothing to announce today.” “As Secretary Blinken has said consistently, and as he has said to Wang Yi, as we have all said to the PRC, we are open to dialogue when it is in our interest to do so, and when we believe the conditions are right,” she said. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said Monday that there are no current plans for Blinken to meet with any Chinese officials in Munich, but he did not explicitly rule out the possibility and said the US is ""always assessing options for diplomacy."" US secretaries of state typically attend the annual meeting, Price did not explicitly confirm that Blinken will travel to the annual summit, saying, “We'll have an opportunity to speak to Secretary Blinken’s potential travel” at a later date. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin confirmed Wang’s attendance at the conference but did not mention any potential meeting with Blinken. US-China tensions: Blinken called off a planned trip to Beijing at the beginning of February due to the presence of the surveillance balloon in US airspace.   Blinken said he spoke to Wang the day the trip was postponed — and the day before the balloon was shot down — to inform him of the trip’s postponement and tell him that the presence of the balloon was “a clear violation of US sovereignty and international law,” “an irresponsible act, and that the PRC’s decision to take this action on the eve of my planned visit is detrimental to the substantive discussions that we were prepared to have.” There have been some conversations between US and Chinese officials since the surveillance balloon was shot down. The Chinese Foreign Ministry and Chinese Embassy in Washington both lodged “stern representations” with US officials, which US National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson described as Beijing “scrambling to do damage control, rather than credibly address their intrusion into our airspace.” The White House on Monday denied that President Joe Biden’s recent swift actions to take down high-altitude objects hovering over the American and North American airspace were the result of political pressure, following earlier critiques that he waited too long to make the call to shoot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon.  “These were decisions based purely and simply on what was in the best interest of the American people,” John Kirby, National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications, said during the White House press briefing Monday. He was responding to a question on whether there’s been a change to the threshold for the use of American fighter jets to take down flying objects. The US, Kirby argued, is “using established protocols to engage… aircraft in the air that can be legitimately brought down.”  While other options were considered to take down the objects, including gunfire, the use of air-to-air missiles was determined to be “the safest, most effective"" way. Kirby, however, did not rule out changes to the threshold for escalation in the future, saying that is something officials are still evaluating as they learn more about the objects.  President Joe Biden has tapped National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan to lead “an interagency team to study the broader policy implications for detection, analysis, and disposition of unidentified aerial objects that pose either safety or security risks,” national security spokesperson John Kirby said Monday. The group — which includes Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines — is tasked with engaging “their relevant counterparts to share information and to try to gain their perspectives as well,” while the administration will brief members of Congress and local officials in the meantime, Kirby said. Kirby, who is the White House national security coordinator for strategic communications, also said none of the three most recent objects shot down posed a threat to people on the ground, were not sending communications signals, showed no signs of “maneuvering or had any propulsion capabilities,” and were not manned. All three missions to shoot them down were completed “successfully and safely” and recovery efforts are underway, though the administration acknowledged all three objects were shot down “in pretty remote terrain — ice and wilderness,” which have complicated reconnaissance efforts. United States officials are revealing new details about the objects that were shot down in the last few days.   The US military shot down a high-altitude object over Lake Huron on Sunday afternoon, the Pentagon said. Another unidentified object was shot down over northern Canada on Saturday, and on Friday, an unidentified object was shot down in Alaska airspace. All three objects looked different, according to two US officials. One official said they were approximately the same size.  Multiple officials said the objects shot down in Alaska and over Canada were believed to have had payloads, meaning that something is being carried by the object. Two officials said none of the three objects were believed to have had propulsion, though the wreckage still needs to be examined to be sure.  “I'm not able to categorize how they stay aloft. It could be a gaseous type of balloon inside a structure or it could be some type of propulsion system. But clearly, they're able to stay aloft,"" NORAD Commander Gen. Glen VanHerck said Sunday. Here's what we now know about the objects: Off the coast of northern Alaska: It was described as a metallic object that broke into several pieces when it impacted the sea ice, according to multiple US officials. That suggests it may have had some sort of structure to it, but officials won't know for sure until the object is recovered. 
Over Lake Huron: CNN reported on Sunday that the most recent object shot down over Lake Huron was “octagonal” in shape with strings hanging off and no discernible payload, according to a senior administration official. It was traveling at 20,000 feet when it was shot down, the Pentagon said Sunday.
Over northern Canada: The object shot down over the Yukon territory in Canada appeared to be a balloon with a metal payload hanging underneath, according to the officials. The object was also traveling at 40,000 feet, Canadian Defense Minister Anita Anand said on Saturday. She went on to describe the object as a “cylindrical object” smaller than the Chinese surveillance balloon that was downed off the coast of South Carolina one week earlier. The preliminary descriptions of the objects' appearances underscore the difficulty for administration officials in identifying their purpose or origin. Officials have been at a loss to say what the objects could be, and the preliminary descriptions have not lent any more clarity. Officials have taken pains to distinguish the three objects shot down over the last three days and the Chinese balloon shot down over the Atlantic Ocean. The three later objects were all smaller in size and flying at a much lower altitude. ##Catch Up## The White House said Monday that recent ""enhanced radar capabilities"" may partially explain why more objects have been detected in the US airspace. John Kirby, National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications, explained during a White House press briefing that since the Chinese balloon program's ""recent incursion into our airspace the United States and Canada — through (North American Aerospace Command) NORAD — have been more closely scrutinizing that airspace, including enhancing our radar capabilities."" The White House official said that it's difficult for radar to pick up small objects, including one the size of the Chinese balloon on radar and that there are also non-military objects that are used in US airspace for scientific purposes.  On the objects that were shot down over the weekend Kirby added, ""Because we have not been able to definitively assess what these most recent objects are, we acted out of an abundance of caution to protect the security, our security, our interests, and flight safety.""  White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre kicked off Monday’s press briefing by clarifying that the US is not concerned about alien or extraterrestrial life as it pertains to the takedown of multiple airborne objects in recent days.   “I just wanted to make sure we address this from the White House: I know there have been questions and concerns about this but there is no again no indication of aliens or extraterrestrial activity with these recent takedowns,” Jean-Pierre said. She added, “I wanted to make sure that the American people knew that all of you knew that. And it was important for us to say that from here because we've been hearing a lot about it,” prompting laughter from reporters in the briefing room.  She joked that she “loved ET, the movie,” before handing the podium to National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby.  The US is still working to determine the nature and purpose of flying objects that have recently been downed. National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby said the suspected Chinese spy balloon that was shot down over United States airspace last week provided ""limited"" intelligence to China. He said the craft was part of the People's Republic of China high-altitude balloon program for intelligence gathering. ""We assessed that at this time, these balloons have provided limited additive capabilities to the PRC's other intelligence platforms used over the United States,"" he said at a White House press briefing Monday. ""But in the future, if the PRC continues to advance this technology, it certainly could become more valuable to them,"" he added.  Kirby said the Chinese balloon program was operating during the Trump administration, but the objects were not detected then. Moving forward, the US is working to better understand and track these intelligence assets. Kirby said efforts are underway to recover debris from the trio of smaller, lower high-altitude objects shot down off the coast of Alaska, over Canada, and over Lake Huron over the weekend, which, in contrast with last weekend’s Chinese surveillance balloon, were flying low enough to pose a threat to civilian air traffic. “We are laser focused on confirming their nature and purpose, including through intensive efforts to collect debris in the remote locations where they have fallen,” Kirby said.  “In each instance, we have followed the same basic course — we assessed whether they posed any kinetic threat to people on the ground-- they did not. We assessed whether they were sending any communication signals — we detected none. We looked to see whether they were maneuvering or had any propulsion capabilities —we saw no signs of that. And we made sure to determine whether or not they were manned or not.” All three missions were completed “successfully and safely,” and recovery efforts are underway, though the administration acknowledged all three objects were shot down “in pretty remote terrain—ice and wilderness,” which have complicated reconnaissance efforts. CNN's DJ Judd contributed reporting to this post.  White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre is holding a press briefing alongside John Kirby, National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications. Kirby's appearance during the briefing comes a day after the Pentagon said a US F-16 fighter jet shot down another airborne object over Lake Huron at the direction of President Joe Biden, marking the third time in a week that US fighter jets have taken down objects in North American airspace. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill have urged the Biden administration to provide more details about the objects. All senators will get a classified briefing Wednesday on China, according to a Senate aide. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Monday that intelligence agencies are “getting new evidence every hour” on the suspected Chinese spy balloon as they examine pieces of it that were collected.  In an interview on ""The View"" on Monday morning, he added that senators will learn a lot more information at their all-Senate briefing on Wednesday. Schumer said the US military and intelligence agencies are “focused like a laser"" on figuring out what happened and coming up with a plan to deal with this particular balloon and any other assets in the future. Schumer reiterated he’s supportive of a bipartisan Senate investigation into “why we didn’t know” about the balloons sooner.  A high-altitude object was shot down near Lake Huron on Sunday afternoon, marking the fourth time in just over a week that the US military has taken down objects in North American airspace. Here's a timeline of all the objects that we know about: Last weekend: A suspected Chinese surveillance balloon was taken down by F-22s off the coast of South Carolina. Friday: An unidentified object was shot down in Alaska airspace by a US F-22. Saturday: Another unidentified object was shot down by US fighter jets over northern Canada on Saturday. Sunday: The US military shot down another high altitude object over Lake Huron on Sunday afternoon, the Pentagon said. Here's a look at where the objects were shot down: The US intelligence community’s method to track China’s fleet of surveillance balloons was only discovered within the last year, six people familiar with the matter told CNN. The findings have allowed the US to develop a consistent technical method for the first time, which they have used to track the balloons in near-real time across the globe, the sources said. The revelation that the intelligence community only within the last year developed a reliable way to track China’s balloon fleet – which officials now say has flown dozens of missions worldwide – helps explain why Trump administration officials have stridently claimed to have had no knowledge of the three alleged flights over US territory during the former president’s time in office. In other words, it’s possible that it’s not so much the objects that are new, but our ability to track them. And, as CNN’s Natasha Bertrand reported Sunday, NORAD command recently readjusted its filters to better spot slow-moving targets operating above a certain altitude. “In light of the People’s Republic of China balloon that we took down last Saturday, we have been more closely scrutinizing our airspace at these altitudes, including enhancing our radar, which may at least partly explain the increase in objects that we detected over the past week,” Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense and Hemispheric Affairs, Melissa Dalton said. China has accused the US of “illegally” flying high-altitude balloons into its airspace more than 10 times since January 2022. The White House responded to those claims by saying the allegation is false. “Any claim that the US government operates surveillance balloons over the PRC is false. It is China that has a high-altitude surveillance balloon program for intelligence collection, that it has used to violate the sovereignty of the US and over 40 countries across 5 continents,” a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, Adrienne Watson, wrote on Twitter. A US F-16 fighter jet shot down another airborne object over Lake Huron on Sunday afternoon at the direction of President Joe Biden, the Pentagon said. Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said the object was not assessed to be a military threat, but it was a flight hazard. “We did not assess it to be a kinetic military threat to anything on the ground, but assess it was a safety flight hazard and a threat due to its potential surveillance capabilities. Our team will now work to recover the object in an effort to learn more,” Ryder said. Melissa Dalton, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense and Hemispheric Affairs, echoed that sentiment Sunday night, telling reporters the objects were taken down out of an “abundance of caution.” She added that high-altitude objects can be used by a range of companies, countries, and research organizations for “purposes that are not nefarious, including legitimate research.” The operation marks the third day in a row that an unidentified object was shot down over North American airspace. An unidentified object was shot down over northern Canada on Saturday. On Friday, an unidentified object was shot down in Alaska airspace by a US F-22. Ryder said the object shot down Sunday was the same one that radar detected on Saturday over Montana that caused airspace to briefly close in the evening. The object was flying at 20,000 feet over Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, a senior administration official told CNN on Sunday. It was “octagonal” with strings hanging off and no discernible payload, according to the official and another source briefed on the matter. The path of the object and its altitude raised concerns that it could pose a threat to civilian aircraft, but it did not pose a military threat to anyone on the ground, the official said. Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan said Sunday that the operation to down the object over Lake Huron was carried out by pilots from the US Air Force and the National Guard. CNN’s Hannah Sarisohn, Aaron Pellish and Jack Forrest contributed to this report. All senators will get a classified briefed this Wednesday on China, according to a Senate aide. Senators were also briefed last week on China. The briefings come as many questions remain about a string of unidentified objects that were shot down over North American airspace this weekend after a Chinese surveillance balloon was taken down by F-22s off the coast of South Carolina earlier this month.  Chinese surveillance balloons have been spotted in the Middle East over the last few years, the commander of US Air Forces Central said on Monday. “We have seen surveillance balloons in the AOR … they did not go anywhere near our sensitive sites but we have seen them in the past transiting through the region,” Lt. Gen. Alexus Grynkewich told reporters at an event at the Center for New American Security (CNAS), adding that the ones he knew of were Chinese balloons. “I’m actually interested in getting some of those very high-altitude balloons for surveillance purposes to get a more persistent stare on some of the places where we don’t see as well as we can,” he added. “They haven’t been a threat to us but we’ve certainly observed them.”  Grynkewich’s comments come after an eventful weekend as the US shot down three unidentified objects in North American airspace in as many days, following the takedown of a Chinese surveillance balloon the week prior. Officials were cautious to not characterize the objects as balloons, saying they were waiting to learn more after the debris was recovered. The balloons spotted in the Middle East never hung out over Americans bases, Grynkewich said, recalling the latest instance in which a balloon “primarily stayed out over the water.” There’s “no regular pattern to it,” he said, adding that there was roughly three instances he could recall over the last few years. He declined to go into detail about the latest event, which he said happened in the fall of 2022. “[W]e’re not sure if it was a weather balloon or some sort of a surveillance balloon, we never got up close, it was never a threat. We never had to go inspect it and get a visual and identification of it,” he said.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",192,175.0,0.005833333333333334,0.9363333333333332,0.05783333333333333,0.5378,0.043,0.877,0.08,0.9997,103.2576,128.10562785714288,396.0,0.3234990602453103
Ron DeSantis can now make his agenda a reality ahead of a possible 2024 announcement,2023-02-14,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis will soon have new authority over Disney's iconic Florida theme parks, leeway to transport migrants from anywhere in the country and fewer hurdles to put people behind bars for voting errors -- all top priorities that have animated conservatives who may decide the next Republican nominee for president.  And he amassed this power in less than a week. DeSantis possesses a unique asset as he lays the groundwork for a potential presidential campaign: A subservient state party that is eager to hand victories to the Republican leader. The special session in Florida that ended Friday -- during which his priorities sailed through the GOP-legislature in a matter of days and with minimal resistance -- was a public demonstration of his total control over an ostensibly separate branch of government.  It's a tool he is expected to wield often in the coming months as he eschews an early entrance into the race in favor of building up a record of decisive actions that could be appealing to future primary voters. DeSantis has already laid out several legislative targets when lawmakers meet again next month, including fewer restrictions on firearms, more restrictions on abortion, weaker legal protections for the media industry and more public funding to attend private schools. With Republicans holding a super majority in both the state House and Senate, there is little expectation that DeSantis will not get his way.  DeSantis isn't expected to jump into the race for president until after lawmakers conclude their legislative business in May -- a sign of how important that agenda is to his platform for president and the narrative around his candidacy. ""Everyone is just waiting to take their cues from the governor,"" one longtime Florida lobbyist said. ""He is setting the agenda and it's all red meat for 2024 voters."" So far DeSantis isn't missing out on a crowded nomination battle. Former President Donald Trump remains the only declared candidate, but more appear not far behind. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is expected to announce her campaign on Wednesday. New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu formed a new political organization as he inches toward a decision. Others, like former Vice President Mike Pence, former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie have openly acknowledged their interest in the office.  Behind-the-scenes, DeSantis is also readying a political operation for a presidential campaign, with an eye toward making a campaign announcement in late May or early June, two people close to the governor said.  His top advisers are in the early stages of launching an organization that could become a super PAC to support his 2024 bid. His memoir ""The Courage to be Free"" will drop at the end of February, leading into a national book tour and media blitz. The decision for DeSantis to invite top Republican fundraisers to a retreat and policy conference later this month in Palm Beach -- the former president's backyard -- is the latest sign of how the governor is ramping up his operation in hopes of sending a signal to donors that he is serious about jumping into the race and he won't be deterred by Trump.  But DeSantis has otherwise dismissed speculation around his political ambitions. Even as he becomes the focus of attacks from the prospective field -- most notably by Trump, but also Sununu and Hogan -- DeSantis has avoided counterattacks that might distract from his focus on stacking legislative wins and culture war victories that his political advisers believe will give him a platform to take to voters, especially in a field full of candidates who are no longer in office. ""It's awkward for many of us who genuinely like President Trump, but believe Governor DeSantis should be our party's nominee,"" said a major donor who talks often with DeSantis. ""Trump can't beat Biden. We've seen that already."" While no president in American history has come from Florida, the prospect of the state having two 2024 GOP candidates -- DeSantis and Trump -- has added another layer of intrigue and questions of loyalty among many Republican donors, strategists and officials. For weeks, Trump has steadily intensified his criticism of DeSantis. For his part, DeSantis has largely ignored the attacks and responded by either declining to attack fellow Republicans or pointing to his 19-point victory in the midterm elections last fall. As the Republican field begins taking shape, DeSantis is sending clear signals to donors and prospective campaign staff that he intends to run. But he feels no urgency or pressure to accelerate his timeline. ""I spend my time delivering results for the people of Florida and fighting against Joe Biden,"" DeSantis said when asked about recent Trump attacks on social media. ""That's how I spend my time. I don't spend my time trying to smear other Republicans."" DeSantis has pushed the limits of his executive authority to hold the spotlight and amass a record tailor-made for a primary battle against Trump. He recently stacked the board of New College, a small liberal arts school, with political allies and like-minded conservatives who have already shaken up the progressive university. Under his watch, transgender children can no longer access certain treatments, and he used his veto powers to eliminate funding for LGBTQ mental health programs. He ousted a twice-elected local prosecutor for simply promising not to use office resources to go after abortion providers.  But it's through the legislature that DeSantis has built the bulk of his political resume, and where he has demonstrated his command of his party. On Monday, DeSantis launched his latest salvo against the financial industry, announcing a proposal to block banks from lending or investing based on environmental, social and governance factors. ""Why is it always someone has to try to jam their agenda down our throats?"" DeSantis said at a news conference to unveil his plan to take on so-called ""woke"" banks. The special session last week was the sixth time lawmakers were called back to Tallahassee in two and a half years to take on DeSantis' priorities outside of their regularly scheduled meeting. This time they assembled largely to clean up existing measures taken by DeSantis that earned the governor considerable praise in conservative media but also legal headaches for the state.  Lawmakers during the five-day special session voted to give the statewide prosecutor jurisdiction to go after Floridians for violating election and voting crimes. The measure comes after DeSantis initiated a crackdown on voter fraud that resulted in the arrest of 20 individuals accused of voting illegally in 2020. However, the move hit a legal snag in some cases, including in Miami-Dade County, where a judge dismissed a case against a Miami defendant on the grounds that the state prosecutor had acted beyond its authority. Similarly, the Republican controlled-legislature gave DeSantis the power to transport migrants from anywhere in the country after a legal challenge arose when the governor last year sent two planes of migrants from San Antonio, Texas, to Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, despite a state law that the state's authority was limited to relocating ""unauthorized aliens from this state."" The move last week to give DeSantis the power to pick the board members for Disney's special taxing district was also a step to avoid a potential financial catastrophe after DeSantis last year demanded lawmakers vote to dissolve the Reedy Creek Improvement District without a plan for its existing debt and contracts. Republican lawmakers, though, were happy to oblige.  ""As the governor says, there's a new sheriff in town,"" state House Speaker Paul Renner said as lawmakers prepared to hand control of Disney's special taxing district over to DeSantis.  Democrats in Florida, powerless to stop DeSantis and his allies, have mostly used the bully pulpit to criticize their GOP colleagues for ceding so much control to the executive branch.  ""I don't understand why we just give away this ultimate power to one individual who should live up to the consequences of breaking the law,"" said state Rep. Anna Eskamani, an Orlando Democrat. ""The reality is that we have a governor who's setting up a presidential bid. And this is basically his attempt to get earned media time on Fox News.""","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",57,176.0,0.09333333333333332,0.8602222222222221,0.04655555555555555,-0.13475714285714285,0.082,0.824,0.095,0.8071,-7.681157142857143,94.36620285714288,402.0,0.23474179815209673
"Opinion: The GOP can't ignore the blockbuster report on Trump, Kushner and Saudi funds",2023-02-14,"James Comer, chairman of the House Oversight and Accountability Committee, has kicked off his committee's investigation into whether President Joe Biden's son Hunter, Biden's brother James and others in the Biden orbit somehow profited financially from their connection to the President.  Comer, a Kentucky Republican, alleged in a letter last week to Hunter Biden that he and his associates ""peddled influence to generate millions of dollars for the Biden family."" He declared in his committee's press release touting the investigation, ""The American people deserve transparency and accountability about the Biden family's influence peddling.""  If Comer is sincere about transparency and accountability when it comes to influence peddling in politics, then he should be readying similar letters to Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump. All three may have personally profited from their time in the White House. When it comes to Kushner, Trump's son-in-law who was his senior White House adviser, and the former President, we need look no further for evidence demanding an investigation than this weekend's blockbuster Washington Post article titled ""After helping prince's rise, Trump and Kushner benefit from Saudi funds.""  Asked whether his committee would investigate the Post's reporting, Comer told ABC's ""This Week,"" ""I think everything's on the table,"" before he quickly turned to the current probe of the Biden family.  If Comer reads this article, he will see red flag after red flag of how Kushner and Trump potentially pocketed money from recent business deals with the Saudi government after helping Saudi Arabia and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, widely known as MBS, while in the White House. (Representatives for the Trump Organization and Kushner did not respond to CNN's request for comment about the Post report. The former President and his son-in-law also declined to comment to the newspaper.) Don Fox, former acting director of the Office of Government Ethics, told the Post that there was no requirement for Trump, a former commander in chief, or Kushner, a former senior White House official, to disclose financial ties to foreign governments. ""He said their work has exposed a glaring shortfall in ethics laws that needs to be fixed by Congress,"" the paper reported. As the Post details, Kushner and Trump both were facing ""unprecedented business challenges"" when they left the White House. Trump had seen revenue from his properties dramatically decline, plus the controversy surrounding the January 6, 2021, attack made him toxic, according to the Post. Kushner was facing his own challenges, with his family business needing a $1.2 billion bailout, the newspaper reported.  Then came Saudi Arabia and MBS to the rescue. In Kushner's case, a fund controlled by MBS invested $2 billion in Kushner's newly formed private equity firm, Affinity Partners, six months after he left the White House, The New York Times reported last year.  A panel that screens investments for the Saudis had raised concerns over this investment on a range of issues, including ""the inexperience of the Affinity Fund management,"" according to the Times. But the board headed by MBS overruled the panel and awarded the massive investment that will result in a payday to Kushner's company of $25 million a year — not including profits earned from investments, the Times reported.  This deal raises concerns about Kushner's repeated lobbying in favor of MBS and Saudi Arabia while in the Trump White House. The relationship between the two men may have yielded benefits for MBS after a US intelligence report on the October 2018 murder of Jamal Khashoggi determined that the crown prince had approved the operation to capture or kill the Saudi journalist. ""Kushner became the prince's most important defender inside the White House,"" the Times reported in 2018 after the killing. (MBS has denied involvement in the murder.) Beyond the Khashoggi controversy, Kushner used his influence in ""persuading Trump to prioritize Saudi Arabia over the objections of top advisers,"" the Post noted this weekend, citing Kushner's own written account. The Post also laid out how Trump appears to be benefiting from his defense of MBS and Saudi Arabia while in the White House. After a CIA report concluded MBS had authorized Khashoggi's killing, Trump publicly undermined the report's conclusions and opposed releasing the report, according to the Post. He also vetoed a congressional attempt to block arms sales to Saudi Arabia.   Trump wasn't shy about what he did for MBS, stating in a recorded interview with Bob Woodward about the Saudi crown prince: ""I saved his ass.""   Now we see Trump hosting Saudi-backed LIV Golf tournaments at his golf courses — which typically pay the course owner in the case of PGA events $2 million to $3 million, as the Post reported. However, Trump has not revealed how much he's pocketing from the Saudis — which is especially alarming given he is running for President in 2024.   The Trump Organization also has recently secured an agreement with a Saudi real estate company that plans to build a Trump-branded hotel, villas and golf course in Oman as part of a $4 billion project, according to The New York Times. Then there's Trump's daughter Ivanka, who was also a White House adviser. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a watchdog group, urged the Justice Department to investigate her four years ago over potentially violating conflict of interest laws by participating in the implementation of a program giving tax breaks for investors in so-called opportunity zones. (A spokesperson for Trump's ethics attorney called the claim ""politically motivated and meritless."") CREW also had raised concerns over Ivanka Trump's business receiving ""registration"" approval for trademarks from the Chinese government in 2018 around the time that her father lifted sanctions on Chinese telecommunications company ZTE — whose controlling shareholder is a Chinese state-owned corporation. Later in 2018, Ivanka Trump's business received approval for 16 new trademarks from the Chinese government on a range of goods — from shoes and jewelry to voting machines. These approvals occurred while her father was negotiating a trade deal with China.  In defense of the applications for trademark, Abigail Klem, then the president of the Ivanka Trump brand, said in 2017, ""We have recently seen a surge in trademark filings by unrelated third parties trying to capitalize on the name and it is our responsibility to diligently protect our trademark."" Ivanka Trump's lawyer at the time, Jamie Gorelick, said, ""Ivanka has had no involvement with trademark applications submitted by the business"" because she resigned from her position with the company. ""The federal ethics rules do not require you to recuse from any matter concerning a foreign country just because a business that you have an ownership interest in has a trademark application pending there."" Comer is correct that the ""American people deserve transparency and accountability"" when it comes to anyone profiting off political connections — especially when the people officially served in our government. If Comer is sincere, we should be seeing letters demanding the same information from Kushner, Trump and daughter Ivanka as he sent to Hunter Biden.  If not, then we know the congressman is doing nothing more than using our tax dollars to try to hurt the President and help the GOP.","{'neg': 0.182, 'neu': 0.695, 'pos': 0.122, 'compound': -0.2584}",42,177.0,0.038380952380952384,0.8921904761904762,0.06942857142857144,0.1841578947368421,0.059,0.853,0.088,0.9862,7.7346315789473685,95.62123443609025,420.0,0.22766960580021486
Biden fires Architect of the Capitol after calls for his resignation,2023-02-13,"President Joe Biden fired Architect of the Capitol J. Brett Blanton on Monday following allegations that he misused government resources and was not physically present on the Capitol grounds during the January 6, 2021, insurrection, a White House official said. Biden ""terminated"" Blanton amid bipartisan calls for his firing or resignation, including from House Speaker Kevin McCarthy earlier Monday, the official said. ""After doing our due diligence, the Architect of Capitol was terminated at the President's direction,"" the White House official said. In the fall, an inspector general report accused Blanton of abuse of government property and wasting taxpayer dollars by allowing his family to drive a government-owned vehicle and taking the vehicle on out-of-town trips to South Carolina and Florida, according to the report. The federal watchdog also accused Blanton, who was appointed by former President Donald Trump, of ethics violations over an offer to provide tours to ""patriots"" weeks before the November 2020 election. Blanton, was grilled last week by members of the House Committee on Administration during a hearing to review a federal watchdog report. The report accused Blanton of ethics violations, abuse of government funds and wasting taxpayer money. In Thursday's hearing, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle jumped on learning that Blanton was not physically present on Capitol grounds on the day of the insurrection, January 6, 2021.  CNN has reached out to the office of the Architect of the Capitol for response to McCarthy's call for Blanton's resignation.  In Thursday's hearing, Blanton unequivocally denied that he did anything unethical. ""I wholeheartedly reject any assertion that I have engaged in unethical behavior during my service to this country while serving in this particular role, I have taken my commitment to transform the agency's culture to promote positive workplace for every AOC employee,"" Blanton said. ""Moreover, I have fully invested to ensure that I meet the responsibilities and the expectations of this role."" In an exchange with the committee chairman, Republican Rep. Bryan Steil of Wisconsin, Blanton defended not being at the Capitol during the insurrection because he claimed he was unable to drive there since there were so many people on the grounds. Blanton also stated that on January 6 he was using his official vehicle as the Architect of the Capitol's mobile command post.  Steil also called for Blanton to resign Monday. Other members, including the ranking Democrat, Rep. Joe Morelle of New York, jumped on the admission by Blanton to question why he remained in the ""mobile command center."" ""If you need to be tethered, and if you needed a vehicle to be here, why did you make the decision not to come here and could you not have without the vehicle and all the emergency equipment that's attached to it? Could you not have fulfilled the same function at home using a cell phone?,"" Morelle asked Blanton. Blanton responded that he did not have police radios and sufficient equipment in his house.  Blanton is one of three voting members of the United States Capitol Police Board, which oversees the USCP. His responsibilities include overseeing the Capitol's property management and operations. After recounting her experience of being stranded on a balcony during the insurrection, Democratic Rep. Norma Torres of California grew visibly frustrated. ""I am outraged that you would be in a comfortable place while the rest of us were thinking about dying that day and how we were going to come out alive that day, outrageous that you were not here,"" she said.

"More than half of Twitter's top 1,000 advertisers stopped spending on platform, data show",2023-02-10,"More than half of Twitter's top 1,000 advertisers in September were no longer spending on the platform in the first weeks of January, according to data provided to CNN by digital marketing analysis firm Pathmatics by Sensor Tower, in a striking sign of how far reaching the advertiser exodus has been following Elon Musk's acquisition of the company.  Some 625 of the top 1,000 Twitter advertisers, including major brands such as Coca-Cola, Unilever, Jeep, Wells Fargo and Merck, had pulled their ad dollars as of January, according to estimates from Pathmatics, based on data running through January 25.  Wells Fargo said it ""paused our paid advertising on Twitter"" but continues to use it as a social channel to engage with customers. The other brands did not immediately respond to a request for comment. As a result of the pullback, monthly revenue from Twitter's top 1,000 advertisers plummeted by more than 60% from October through January 25, from around $127 million to just over $48 million, according to the data. The data demonstrate the sharp decline of what was once a $4.5 billion advertising business for Twitter. After Musk completed his takeover of the company in late October, advertisers began to worry about the safety and stability of the platform given his plans to cut staff and relax content moderation policies. In early November, Musk said Twitter had seen a ""massive revenue drop."" Although Twitter's ad business was always much smaller than that of competitors Facebook and Google, it was still responsible for the vast majority of the company's revenue. Musk must now fill in that gap as he stares down interest payments for the debt he took on to buy Twitter for $44 billion.   Twitter, which eliminated much of its media relations team during last year's layoffs, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. After initially clashing with advertisers, Musk now appears to be trying to woo them back to the platform. The company reportedly offered a Super Bowl ""fire sale"" deal for advertisers in an attempt to win them back for one of Twitter's biggest audience days of the year. Twitter has also partnered with a third-party ""brand safety"" firm that says it can show advertisers if their ads appear alongside inappropriate or unsafe content on Twitter.   But the pushback continues. A coalition of civil society and civil rights groups renewed calls on Thursday for companies to join what they say is more than 500 advertisers who have stopped advertising on Twitter. The latest effort came after a research report from the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a member of the coalition, raised concerns about ads ""appearing next to toxic content"" from previously banned accounts.  In his first months in charge, Musk rolled back bans on users who had previously violated Twitter's rules, including former President Donald Trump. He also dissolved a third-party content oversight group and halted enforcement of its Covid-19 misinformation policy.  Some advertisers also complained that the Twitter employees they previously worked with had been terminated by Musk, causing confusion. In November, Musk complained that Twitter had seen a ""massive drop in revenue.""  But Musk has stood by those policy changes, and has since been scrambling to reduce costs and find new revenue streams for the company. Those efforts include dramatically cutting staff, revamping its paid subscription service and, more recently, announcing the controversial move to charge researchers and developers reliant on Twitter's API, which allows third parties to tap into Twitter's systems. For now, however, Twitter remains reliant on advertising revenue as it reportedly struggles to grow its paid subscriber base.  Even among the top advertisers that remain, many have dramatically reduced their ad spending on the platform, according to Pathmatics data. HBO, for example, was Twitter's top advertiser in September, spending nearly $12 million on ads that month, but for the month of January (as of January 25), it spent just over $54,000. (HBO, which is owned by CNN parent company Warner Bros. Discovery, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.) A small number of Twitter's top advertisers spent more on the platform in January than they did the month prior to Musk's takeover, including ESPN, Salesforce and Apple, the latter of which Musk briefly and publicly feuded with for allegedly threatening to block Twitter from its app store. ESPN, Salesforce and Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Musk said in a tweet earlier this month that the previous three months had been ""extremely tough, as had to save Twitter from bankruptcy,"" but that the company ""is now trending to breakeven if we keep at it.""

Parts of Georgia grand jury report on Trump and 2020 election aftermath to be made public,2023-02-13,"A judge in Fulton County, Georgia, will make public some parts of a report from a special grand jury that investigated Donald Trump's actions after the 2020 election in the state, but not specific charging recommendations. In his order on Monday, Judge Robert C.I. McBurney said that the special grand jury's introduction and conclusion as well as concerns the panel had about witnesses lying under oath will be made public on Thursday. Some of the information in those sections still may be redacted, the judge noted.  Prosecutors in Georgia have aggressively investigated whether Trump or any of his associates broke the law while trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat in the closely contested state. The special grand jury, barred from issuing indictments, penned the highly anticipated final report as a culmination of its seven months of work, which included interviewing 75 witnesses from Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp to former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani and South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham.  No one has been charged in the case yet, and another grand jury would make those decisions now that the special grand jury has presented its findings. Other findings by the special grand jury won't be public yet -- particularly the parts where the report makes recommendations about potential charges. That's because some of the people named in those recommendations may not have appeared in grand jury proceedings so far. ""Here, however, for anyone named in the special purpose grand jury's final report who was not afforded the opportunity to appear before the grand jury, none of those due process rights has been satisfied,"" McBurney wrote in the eight-page order on Monday. ""And for those who did appear -- willingly or not -- only the right to be heard (although without counsel or rebuttal) was protected,"" McBurney added. A media coalition, which includes CNN, is seeking for the full report to be made public. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis suggested last month that the special grand jury has recommended multiple indictments and said her decision on whether to bring charges is ""imminent.""  At a January court hearing in Atlanta on whether to publicly release the special grand jury report, Willis, a Democrat, said she opposes making it public at the moment, citing her ongoing deliberations of the charges.  ""We want to make sure that everyone is treated fairly, and we think for future defendants to be treated fairly it's not appropriate at this time to have this report released,"" Willis said last month.      On Monday, Willis praised McBurney's order. ""I believe Judge McBurney's order is legally sound and consistent with my request. I have no plans to appeal today's order,"" the DA said in a statement.  Willis' sweeping investigation has sought to determine not only whether Trump committed crimes but also whether there was a broader criminal conspiracy playing out in the efforts to overturn Georgia's election results. In document preservation requests to Georgia officials in February 2021, Willis said she was investigating potential crimes including solicitation of election fraud, making false statements to government bodies, conspiracy, racketeering, violation of oath of office and violence or threats related to election administration. The Georgia probe was set off by an hour-long January 2021 phone call from Trump to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger asking him to ""find"" the votes necessary for Trump to win the Peach State.  Over time, the investigation expanded well beyond the Trump phone call to include false claims of election fraud to state lawmakers, the fake elector scheme, efforts by unauthorized individuals to access voting machines in one Georgia county and threats and harassment against election workers. Willis also investigated the sudden departure of Byung ""BJay"" Pak, the US attorney for the Northern District of Georgia.  Along the way, Willis designated a number of people as targets of her probe, including 16 Georgia Republicans who served as pro-Trump electors in 2020 and Giuliani, who was working as a lawyer for Trump.    While a special grand jury does not issue indictments, it possesses broader investigative powers than a typical grand jury in the state as well as the power to issue subpoenas for witness testimony, phone, email and other records. But how much of that makes it into the final report was up to the special grand jurors. If the special grand jury recommends any indictments, Willis could then seek them from the other grand juries regularly empaneled in Fulton County. Willis has previously said she could pursue Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) charges in this case, which would allow prosecutors to bring charges against multiple defendants and make the case that Trump and his allies were part of a criminal enterprise, and brought in John Floyd, a lawyer with deep expertise in racketeering cases, to assist her office.

The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2024,2023-02-13,"The 2024 Senate map presents a daunting challenge for Democrats. Time will tell if it proves to be insurmountable. The party, which currently holds a narrow 51-49 majority, must defend 23 of the 34 seats up for grabs this cycle. That means Republicans need a net gain of just one or two seats to retake the Senate, depending on which party wins the White House in 2024. The most favorable political terrain for Republicans runs through three states that former President Donald Trump carried by at least 8 points in 2020 -- West Virginia, Montana and Ohio. In all three, Democrats have incumbents with unique political brands who could again have crossover appeal with voters in a reelection race. And Republicans could face messy primary fights in all three states, leaving the eventual nominees weakened heading into the general election.  Beyond that, Democrats are defending Senate seats in a handful of pivotal presidential battlegrounds -- Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. All are expected to be fiercely contested, with Arizona offering the potential for an unpredictable three-way race if Democrat-turned-independent Kyrsten Sinema seeks reelection. Given the overlay of the presidential race, these contests are most likely to see outsize attention with high-profile campaign visits, making them more connected to the national crosscurrents.  If Democrats are searching for targets to offset potential losses, their options are limited. Florida and Texas -- both red-leaning states -- offer the best opportunities. While Florida Sen. Rick Scott has a history of razor-thin elections, he's won them all. The Sunshine State has also been trending toward Republicans in recent years, especially in the era of Trump and Ron DeSantis. In Texas, Sen. Ted Cruz withstood a tough challenge from Beto O'Rourke in 2018, a Democratic-friendly year. Defeating Cruz in a presidential year could pose an even greater test.  As the cycle gets underway, how these Senate races play out could depend on several factors. While all signs point to President Joe Biden seeking reelection, he has yet to formally announce his intentions. The 2024 GOP presidential field is only just starting to take shape, with Trump a clear front-runner for now. Aside from the eventual nominees, the overall environment and mood of the country will also help shape contests up and down the ballot as well as the central campaign issues. The state of the US economy is a constant priority for voters. There are signs that culture issues, including parental rights, are poised to drive the debate within GOP primaries and could emerge as general election flashpoints.  Senate Republicans were unable to capitalize on what appeared to be a favorable midterm environment for them in 2022, in part because of flawed candidates, several of whom were elevated by Trump. Already this year, National Republican Senatorial Committee chair Steve Daines and other GOP leaders have sent signals that the committee could get involved in primaries if it means avoiding nominees who could cost the party in the general election. There are still more than 20 months to go until Election Day 2024, with many twists and turns ahead. But based on CNN's reporting, fundraising figures and historical data about how states and candidates have performed, here is where the Senate map stands at the start of the cycle. 1. West Virginia  Incumbent: Democrat Joe Manchin   West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin has spent much of the past two years at the center of the action in the Democratic-controlled Senate, blocking some of Biden's more ambitious agenda items. He's also leaving Democrats in suspense when it comes to his 2024 plans, so far not saying whether he will seek a third full term.  If he runs, Manchin would start the cycle as the most endangered Democratic incumbent, representing a state that backed Trump by 39 points in 2020 -- down slightly from his 42-point winning margin four years earlier. While Manchin was able to win reelection by 3 points in 2018, his ability to convince Republicans to split their tickets would be put to the test next year. The last time Manchin was on the ballot in a presidential year, he won by 24 points while Republican Mitt Romney was carrying West Virginia by more than 26 points. But that was in 2012, and political polarization has only intensified since then.  Manchin enters the cycle with a sizable $9.5 million war chest, though that's unlikely to dissuade Republicans eager to challenge him. GOP Rep. Alex Mooney launched his Senate bid in November. Other Republicans eyeing the race include Gov. Jim Justice, who is term-limited, and state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, who lost to Manchin in 2018. 2. Montana Incumbent: Democrat Jon Tester   Montana Sen. Jon Tester has been a top target of Republicans ever since he was first elected in 2006, when he narrowly defeated GOP Sen. Conrad Burns in a favorable Democratic midterm environment. A self-described ""seven-fingered dirt farmer"" with a distinctive flat top haircut, Tester cuts a unique profile for a Democrat -- one that has proved difficult for Republicans to pierce in previous elections.  But the GOP is eager to take another shot at unseating the three-term incumbent in a state that Trump carried by more than 16 points in 2020. Much of the talk about potential GOP challengers has focused on the state's two House members, Matt Rosendale and Ryan Zinke. Tester beat Rosendale by more than 3 points in 2018, when the Democrat hammered his GOP rival over his Maryland roots. Zinke, a former Interior secretary under Trump, won a newly created House seat in November by 3 points, underperforming Trump's 7-point spread in a district Montana gained in reapportionment following the 2020 census.  While he hasn't yet announced whether he will seek reelection, Tester enters the cycle sitting on nearly $3 million in cash on hand. 3. Ohio Incumbent: Democrat Sherrod Brown   Unlike Manchin and Tester, three-term Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown has already announced he will run for reelection in 2024. Brown is the only Democrat to win a nonjudicial statewide race in Ohio over the past decade, demonstrating a measure of political resiliency in a GOP-trending state. Trump carried Ohio by 8 points in both 2020 and 2016. Yet Brown still managed to notch a nearly 7-point win in 2018, albeit against a relatively weak GOP challenger in then-Rep. Jim Renacci.  Just as they did in the 2022 race for the state's other Senate seat, Republicans could face a crowded field of candidates. State Sen. Matt Dolan, whose family owns the Cleveland Guardians baseball team, is running again after placing third in the GOP Senate primary last year. Other potential hopefuls include Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, state Attorney General Dave Yost, Rep. Warren Davidson and businessman Bernie Moreno, who dropped out of the 2022 Senate primary.  Brown enters the cycle with $3.4 million in his campaign coffers as he gears up for what could be a bruising and expensive battle in the Buckeye State. 4. Arizona Incumbent: Independent Kyrsten Sinema Sen. Kyrsten Sinema hasn't yet said whether she's running for reelection, but her decision to leave the Democratic Party late last year and become an independent has scrambled this race in a state where Democrats have won three Senate elections in the last three cycles. (Biden also narrowly carried the state in 2020.)  Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego has already entered the race, hoping to tap into progressives' frustration with the moderate first-term senator for being an obstacle to parts of Biden's agenda in the closely divided chamber. Sinema continues to caucus with her former party in the narrowly divided Senate, so national Democrats face a delicate decision if she runs for a second term. While Sinema and Gallego could split votes and help the eventual GOP nominee, Democrats, for now, are happy to deflect to potential messiness on the GOP side.  Republicans considering Senate bids include election deniers such as failed 2020 nominees Blake Masters, who lost a bid for Senate, and Kari Lake, who says last fall's gubernatorial election was stolen from her. Lake met with NRSC officials earlier this month, CNN reported, but she's also holding events in Iowa, which would suggest interest in a different federal office. If there's been a lesson for the Arizona GOP over the last few years here, it's that catering to the more extreme Trump base works well in the state's late-summer primary but alienates voters in the general election. Freshman Rep. Juan Ciscomani, seen as a potential candidate, was tapped to deliver the GOP rebuttal in Spanish to Biden's State of the Union address. 5. Nevada Incumbent: Democrat Jacky Rosen Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen is running for reelection in a state that Biden carried by about 2 points in 2020 and that will again be competitive presidential turf in 2024. That means Rosen can expect Republicans to tie her to the national Democratic Party if she doesn't effectively carve out her own brand.  First elected to the House in 2016 before running successfully for the Senate two years later, Rosen began 2023 with more than $4.4 million in the bank, which should give her a strong fundraising head start on would-be challengers. Republicans came close to knocking off the Silver State's other Democratic senator, Catherine Cortez Masto, last year in a difficult environment for Democrats, who lost the governor's mansion but held on to several down-ballot offices.  Republicans Adam Laxalt, the former state attorney general who lost to Cortez Masto last fall, and Purple Heart recipient Sam Brown, an Army veteran who lost to Laxalt in the 2022 Senate primary, could run again. 6. Wisconsin Incumbent: Democrat Tammy Baldwin Few states have such politically divergent senators as Wisconsin, where progressive Democrat Tammy Baldwin is up for a third term in 2024 and conservative Republican Ron Johnson won reelection last fall by 1 point. Baldwin, the first out LGBTQ member of the Senate, has demonstrated an ability to win in a closely divided state -- she won reelection in 2018 by 11 points in a strong year for Democrats.  The Badger State will once again be a presidential battleground next year after Wisconsin voters narrowly backed Trump and Biden in 2016 and 2020, respectively. Baldwin has pushed for stronger ""Buy America"" policies in legislation such as the bipartisan infrastructure package enacted in 2021, which she'd be likely to tout on the campaign trail. She hasn't officially announced her reelection plans, but she started the year with more than $3 million in the bank.  One of the most prominent Republicans often mentioned as a challenger is Rep. Mike Gallagher, a Marine veteran first elected in 2016. There's an election in April for a state Supreme Court seat, which could affect the court's partisan makeup -- a","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",66,181.0,0.0179,0.8412999999999998,0.1407,0.48574,0.047,0.846,0.107,0.9988,32.058840000000004,-0.18379984962402318,190.0,-0.000967367629600122
Trump lawyer says searches for classified material at Trump properties are complete,2023-02-13,"One of Donald Trump's lawyers said Sunday they have completed their searches for classified material at the former president's properties and handed over what they found to the Justice Department. Timothy Parlatore, who represents Trump in both the special counsel investigation into the former president's handling of classified material and the probe related to the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, confirmed that additional classified documents were found during a search in December and turned over to the Justice Department. ""We've tried to do searches of all the relevant places, and anytime we've found anything, we've immediately turned it over,"" Parlatore told CNN in an exclusive interview, painting his client as cooperative in the ongoing criminal probe. He also confirmed that Trump's team handed over to DOJ an empty manilla folder marked ""Classified Evening Summary"" after receiving a subpoena for that item, which was found in the former president's bedroom. According to Parlatore, Trump had effectively been using the empty folder as a lamp shade to block a light on his landline telephone that was keeping him up at night. ""He has one of those landline telephones next to his bed, and it has a blue light on it, and it keeps him up at night. So he took the manilla folder and put it over so it would keep the light down so he could sleep at night,"" Parlatore said. ""It's just this folder. It says 'Classified Evening Summary' on it. It's not a classification marking. It's not anything that is controlled in any way. There is nothing illegal about it."" CNN reported Friday that the folder was among the items that Trump's legal team has turned over to federal prosecutors in recent months, in addition to more materials with classified markings and a laptop belonging to an aide. Parlatore also reiterated Sunday that the aide had no idea the material the aide scanned on the laptop was classified. Pressed on why classified documents were still being found at Trump's properties two years after he was president, Parlatore blamed the White House procedure for handling sensitive material when an administration leaves office -- equating the situation involving his client to those of former Vice President Mike Pence and President Joe Biden. ""When you have DOJ go into these things, they are automatically going in with all the criminal processes and trying to threaten people to go to jail over something that is a procedural failure and an institutional procedural failure that has nothing to do with Mike Pence, Donald Trump or, quite frankly, Joe Biden,"" he said. Parlatore said the DOJ should be ""benched"" on matters related to classified material and, instead of appointing special counsels, it should be left up to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to conduct an administrative review of the White House's procedure for handling such documents at the end of each presidency. Parlatore confirmed Sunday that Trump intends to assert executive privilege in an effort to limit the testimony of Pence and former national security adviser Robert O'Brien after both were subpoenaed in special counsel Jack Smith's other investigation related to January 6.  He noted that Trump's team advises every witness to protect privilege in those cases, and Pence would be no exception.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",18,182.0,0.067375,0.86725,0.06537499999999999,0.02243749999999997,0.057,0.878,0.065,0.4261,0.4038749999999995,-7.514556428571395,166.0,-0.04526841222030961
Here is what we know about the unidentified objects shot down over North America,2023-02-12,"A high-altitude object was shot down near Lake Huron on Sunday afternoon, marking the fourth time in just over a week that the US military has taken down objects in North American airspace.  On Saturday, an unidentified object was downed over northern Canada, a day after another object had been shot down over Alaska airspace by a US F-22. Last weekend, a Chinese surveillance balloon was taken down by F-22s off the coast of South Carolina. There's no indication at this point that the unidentified objects have any connection to China's surveillance balloon, but it seems that national security officials across the continent remain on edge.  Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan said Sunday that the operation to down the object near Lake Huron was carried out by pilots from the US Air Force and the National Guard.  CNN initially reported that the object was shot down over Lake Huron based on what sources said to CNN and a public tweet by Republican Rep. Jack Bergman of Michigan. The object was first detected by the North American Aerospace Defense Command and the US Northern Command over Montana on Saturday night, and fighter aircraft were sent to investigate, a senior administration official told CNN. At the time, those planes did not identify any object to correlate to the radar hits, which led NORAD and NORTHCOM to believe it was an anomaly. But on Sunday, defense officials reacquired the radar contact and detected the object flying over Wisconsin and then Michigan. The path of the object and its altitude raised concerns that it could pose a threat to civilian aircraft, but it did not pose a military threat to anyone on the ground, the official said. President Joe Biden ordered the object to be shot down.  Here's what we know so far: Description of objects Prior to the takedown of the object near Lake Huron, a US official said Sunday there had been caution inside the Biden administration on the pilot descriptions of the unidentified objects shot down over Alaska and Canada due to the circumstances in which the objects were viewed. ""These objects did not closely resemble and were much smaller than the PRC balloon and we will not definitively characterize them until we can recover the debris, which we are working on,"" a National Security Council spokesperson said, referring to the suspected Chinese spy balloon. Earlier Sunday, Deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh also noted the difference between the incidents.  ""These objects shot down on Friday and Saturday were objects and did not closely resemble the PRC balloon. When we can recover the debris, we will have more for you,"" she said Sunday  Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told ABC News on Sunday morning that he was briefed by White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan and that the object shot down over Canada was likely another balloon -- as was the high-altitude object downed over Alaska on Friday. On Saturday, Canada's chief of defense staff, Gen. Wayne Eyre, also made mention of a ""balloon"" when describing instructions given to the team that worked to take down the object. 'A cylindrical object' The unidentified object that was shot down in Canadian airspace had been tracked since Friday evening, according to a statement from Pentagon spokesman Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder. The object was detected by NORAD, and two F-22 fighter jets from Joint Base Elemendorf-Richardson, Alaska, were sent up to monitor the object with the help of the Alaska Air National Guard. The object appears to be a ""cylindrical object"" smaller than the Chinese surveillance balloon that was shot down previously, Canadian Defense Minister Anita Anand said at a news conference on Saturday. ""Monitoring continued today as the object crossed into Canadian airspace, with Canadian CF-18 and CP-140 aircraft joining the formation to further assess the object,"" Ryder's statement said. Eyre said Saturday that ""the instructions that were given to the the team was whoever had the first best shot to take out the balloon had to go ahead."" US President Joe Biden and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau both approved the shoot-down on Saturday, according to a statement from the White House. ""President Biden authorized US fighter aircraft assigned to NORAD to conduct the operation and a US F-22 shot down the object in Canadian territory in close coordination with Canadian authorities,"" the White House statement said. ""The leaders discussed the importance of recovering the object in order to determine more details on its purpose or origin."" The object was shot down with a AIM-9X missile from a US F-22 -- the same missile and aircraft that shot down an unidentified object on Friday, and the Chinese surveillance balloon on February 4. ""The object was flying at an altitude of approximately 40,000 feet, had unlawfully entered Canadian airspace and posed a reasonable threat to the safety of civilian flight. The object was shot down approximately 100 miles from the Canada-United States border over Canadian territory in central Yukon,"" she said. Ryder's statement said that while Canadian authorities conduct recovery operations, the FBI will be ""working closely with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police."" The fourth such shoot-down for US aircraft in just over a week  Sunday's takedown of the unidentified object near Lake Huron marks the fourth such incident in just over week. On Friday, an unidentified object was shot down by a US F-22 over Alaskan airspace after it had been monitored by the US since Thursday evening. Pilots gave different accounts of what they observed after coming near the object, a source briefed on the intelligence told CNN; some pilots said it ""interfered with their sensors,"" but other pilots said they didn't experience that. The object was flying at 40,000 feet, which made it a risk to civilian traffic. That set it apart from the Chinese surveillance balloon, which was traveling ""well above commercial air traffic,"" Ryder said at the time. Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska said Friday, after the unidentified object was shot down over his state, that similar objects have been spotted over Alaska in recent weeks, the Alaska Beacon reported. ""There were things that were seen on radar but weren't explained,"" the Senate Armed Services Committee member told the publication. The Chinese balloon was shot down off the coast of South Carolina last Saturday after traveling across the US. Biden administration officials said it posed little intelligence gathering and military risk. It did, however, pose a risk to people and property on the ground if it were to be shot down, as officials said it was roughly 200 feet tall and the payload weighed more than a couple of thousand pounds. The US military is still working to recover debris from the balloon on the ocean floor. Ryder said Friday that they have ""located a significant amount of debris so far that will prove helpful to our further understanding of this balloon and its surveillance capabilities."" Notably, the US intelligence community's method to track China's fleet of surveillance balloons was only discovered within the last year, six people familiar with the matter told CNN. The findings have allowed the US to develop a consistent technical method for the first time, which they have used to track the balloons in near-real time across the globe, the sources said. Congress reacts Earlier Sunday, before the shooting down of the object near Lake Huron, lawmakers on Capitol Hill offered a range of responses to the recent developments.   House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner told CNN that the Biden administration does appear ""somewhat trigger-happy"" in how it dealt with objects over the weekend after allowing the first spotted balloon to fly across the country. ""What I think this shows, which is probably more important to our policy discussion here, is that we really have to declare that we're going to defend our airspace. And then we need to invest,"" the Ohio Republican added. ""This shows some of the problems and gaps that we have. We need to fill those as soon as possible because we certainly now ascertain there is a threat."" Turner's Democratic counterpart on the Intelligence panel, Connecticut Rep. Jim Himes, told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that he had ""real concerns about why the administration is not being more forthcoming with everything that it knows,"" before adding, ""My guess is that there's just not a lot of information out there to share."" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, meanwhile, said Congress needs to investigate why it took so long for the US to catch on to the Chinese government's use of spy balloons. ""I do think (Democratic Sen. Jon Tester of Montana) is looking into why it took so long for us, our military, our intelligence, to know about these balloons. That's something I support. Congress should look at that. That's the question we have to answer,"" he said. ""I think our military, our intelligence are doing a great job, present and future. I feel a lot of confidence in what they're doing. But why, as far back as the Trump administration, did no one know about this?"" Also Sunday, Rep. Michael McCaul, the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said he remains unconvinced by assertions from the intelligence community that he suspected Chinese spy balloon did not seriously damage US national security during its flight across the country. ""They say they mitigated it, but my assessment -- and I can't get into the detail of the intelligence document -- is that if it was still transmitting, going over these three very sensitive nuclear sites, I think if you look at the flight pattern of the balloon, it tells a story as to what the Chinese were up to, as they controlled this aircraft throughout the United States,"" the Texas Republican told CBS News.

Opinion: Mitt Romney's moments of truth,2023-02-12,"More than a decade has passed since Mitt Romney lost political support during his failed 2012 presidential campaign for boasting about having ""binders full of women"" suitable for government appointments and writing off the ""47% of Americans"" who pay no federal income tax.  But his remark about Russia being America's ""number one geopolitical foe"" — which was widely ridiculed at the time — now seems prescient in the wake of Vladimir Putin's murderous invasion of Ukraine.  In the past few years, the senator from Utah has earned a reputation for being a rare, candid voice in Washington, willing to buck his party. He was the lone Republican who voted to remove President Donald Trump from office in his first impeachment trial and one of seven to do so in Trump's second impeachment.  Minutes before the State of the Union speech Tuesday, Romney encountered the scandal-ridden Republican Rep. George Santos on the House floor and told him what many of the New York congressman's constituents — and others around the country — are saying: ""You don't belong here."" (Santos told reporters afterward: ""It wasn't very Mormon of him."") Even more tellingly, Romney broke with his party's stance on China's spy balloon. After a closed-door briefing by administration officials Thursday, Romney told reporters, ""I believe that the administration, the president, our military and intelligence agencies, acted skillfully and with care,"" and said he agreed with their decision to wait to shoot down the balloon until it moved over the Atlantic Ocean, off the Carolinas.  House Republicans, who were initially planning a resolution condemning the Biden administration for not bringing down the balloon sooner, switched the wording to condemn the government of China for sending the craft over US territory in the first place.  It passed 419-0, a small act of bipartisanship only two days after a group of House Republicans heckled President Joe Biden as he was addressing both houses in his annual speech. There are not a lot of Romneys — or indeed any — in the ranks of the extreme GOPers who bucked their own House Speaker's shushing to shout their displeasure at Biden's remarks. ""Some members of the Republican caucus seemed keen to highlight the distinctions between the thoughtful, unity-emphasizing Biden and their own party's shameful descent,"" wrote Jill Filipovic. ""Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, among others, repeatedly booed and yelled throughout the speech; when he introduced the parents of Tyre Nichols, who was last month fatally beaten by Memphis police officers, and the Ukrainian ambassador, she stayed seated. That perhaps says more than Biden ever could."" Shushing SE Cupp called McCarthy's ""shushing"" a ""surprisingly gallant act of leadership from someone who has aligned himself with former President Donald Trump, voted to overturn the 2020 election results and packed the House Oversight Committee with election deniers.""  ""Will he continue to 'shush' the extremist, conspiratorial and 'Never Biden' wing of his party — whom he has empowered and elevated — as they act out and get in the way of his agenda, which might even include working with Biden from time to time?"" Geoff Duncan, a Republican who formerly served as Georgia's lieutenant governor, wrote that ""neither the southern border nor inflation received much attention from the president — despite both issues being of importance to voters. Neither did the Chinese spy balloon, whose coast-to-coast journey undermines Biden's tough talk toward Chinese President Xi Jinping.""  Biden ""was feisty, full of energy, marshaled his arguments effectively and even batted back Republican catcalls with good humor,"" observed David Gergen. ""By the end of the evening, he looked like a boxer who can't wait to get into the ring again."" ""But he now faces an even sterner test: Did he actually move the needle? Among presidents of the recent past, a public appearance as powerful as this one could shake up politics. Former Presidents Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan each had the capacity to change minds when they held a microphone.""  The president's ""discussion of 'the talk' that Black parents give to their children about how to safely interact with police officers was the most moving part of his speech,"" wrote former Rep. Mondaire Jones, a Democrat.  ""Still, it was political malpractice for him not to explicitly call for Congress to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. The family of Tyre Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man who was fatally beaten by Memphis police officers last month, deserved to hear it.""   Populism Raul Reyes noted that ""Biden smartly aligned himself with populist issues, like making wealthy corporations pay their fair share of taxes and proposing that all federal infrastructure projects use American-made materials.""   The 80-year-old president's vision was decidedly blue-collar — and 20th century — in its aim to rebuild America's manufacturing base and reduce the reliance on trade with the rest of the world.  But, as Julian Zelizer pointed out, ""times have changed and Biden has a tough road ahead. While the president offered a robust vision of how federal investment has and could create jobs in key sectors such as the semi-conductor industry and infrastructure, the kinds of manufacturing jobs that were at the heart of federal investment between the 1930s and 1960s have vastly diminished and are not likely to return.""  ""Biden needs to acknowledge how his economic populism will address the industries of the 2020s rather than those of the 1950s and 1960s.""  Biden's success in 2020 owed a lot to the contrast with the chaos and extremism of the Trump administration, Bill McGowan and Juliana Silva wrote. The outbursts by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and her colleagues allow Biden to surf the same wave now. ""By keeping the hostility factor high, the GOP is also paving the way for Biden to reuse in 2024 one of his stickiest and most effective campaign messages from 2020: that the election is nothing short of a battle for the 'soul of the nation.' Thanks to the new breed of attention-seeking, far-right Republicans, Biden gets to go back to that well regardless of whether Trump is his opponent or not.""  The president turned the heckling to his advantage by getting Republicans to deny any intention of cutting Social Security or Medicare. ""You can say Mr. Biden fibbed, misled and exaggerated, and you wouldn't be wrong,"" Peggy Noonan wrote in the Wall Street Journal, ""but in rope-a-doping Republicans on Medicare and Social Security he showed real mastery.""  New generation? In ""a scathing rebuke"" to Biden's speech that served as the GOP's official reply, ""Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said it's time for a new generation of Republican leadership,"" Alice Stewart noted. ""At 40, Sanders is the youngest governor in the country. She spoke of Biden as the oldest president in American history, and at 80-years-old, she said, he is simply 'unfit to serve as commander in chief.'"" Left unsaid was that Trump, Sanders' former boss, would be 78 by Election Day, 2024 — and he is running for the presidency again. Patrick T. Brown spoke for a lot of Americans when he pleaded for something other than a Biden-Trump rematch: ""A 2024 presidential election that features another slugfest between two elderly leaders rather than a scrappy fight between up-and-coming politicians with energy and enthusiasm would be doing the nation a disservice."" ""New polling suggests a growing desire for new faces. 58% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters told a Washington Post/ABC News poll they hoped their party nominates someone other than Biden in 2024. According to the poll, 49% of Republican and Republican-leaning voters said the same thing about former President Donald Trump.""

A devastating earthquake had struck and they hurried out of the building in their pajamas into snow-filled streets. Taking refuge in their car, away from any buildings, Alomar spoke to CNN Opinion's Sheena McKenzie about the toll the quake is taking on a region already devastated by war.  Alomar is a pediatrician who works as a senior health adviser with the Syrian American Medical Society, providing medical assistance across the border. ""In northwest Syria, we are already suffering from a shortage of supplies, and we are now using the regular inventories in our warehouses,"" Alomar said. ""So we are in urgent need of additional support to compensate these supplies for regular operations — and also to be ready for aftershocks and more casualties who may come to our hospitals.""  In the New York Times, Turkish author and Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk wrote, ""Aid has been dispatched, but the trucks loaded with supplies are stuck for hours on jammed roads hundreds of miles from the affected areas. People who have lost their homes, their families, their loved ones, everything they ever had find that there is nobody doing anything about the fires beginning to break out in their cities. And so they block the path of any official vehicle, policeman or government employee they can find and start to remonstrate. I have never seen our people so angry."" As of Sunday, the death toll in the quake stood at more than 28,000, with tens of thousands injured. Zelensky, a year later A year ago, shortly before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, former comedian-turned-president ""Volodymyr Zelensky's popularity ratings were tanking as he battled allegations of unmet campaign promises to tackle endemic corruption,"" recalled Michael Bociurkiw.  ""Then on February 24, Russia's total invasion blasted these concerns into the background. Almost overnight, that dark cloud over Zelensky vanished as he defied critics, and miraculously pivoted into the role of heroic wartime president and global symbol of defender of the free world."" ""His popularity ratings surged — and have stayed high ever since — currently hovering at around 84%."" But corruption is still pervasive in Ukraine, as recent allegations and a new crackdown have shown, and Bociurkiw argued that it's vital to keep fighting it. ""Zelensky needs to respond to allegations of wrongdoing with the same determination that Ukrainian servicemen have demonstrated on the battlefield."" ""This is an opportunity to create a nation where corruption is not tolerated, and where oligarchs no longer have a free hand to rape and pillage the economy.""

Washington Post: Trump campaign commissioned research that failed to prove 2020 election fraud claims,2023-02-12,"A research firm commissioned by former President Donald Trump's 2020 campaign team to prove his electoral fraud claims instead failed to substantiate his theories, the Washington Post reported Saturday. The Berkeley Research Group was commissioned to look into voting data from six states, according to the Post, and a source told the publication that the campaign team wanted about a dozen claims tested. People familiar with the matter told the publication that the findings did not match what the team had hoped for, and the findings were never released. While some anomalies and ""unusual data patterns"" were found, the Post reported, they wouldn't have made a difference to President Joe Biden's victory.  The firm's findings also refuted some of Trump's voting conspiracies, including the identities of dead people used to vote and Dominion voting systems used to manipulate the outcome, the paper reported. The research was conducted in the last weeks of 2020 and before the January 6 US Capitol attack, according to the Post. Two sources told CNN that the House January 6 committee looking into the role Trump played in inciting the insurrection did not know about the firm's work. 
Trump has continued to repeat his election lies as he focuses on his 2024 White House bid.  CNN previously reported that following two years of advice from allies and advisers to stop exhaustively relitigating the 2020 election, his first rally late last month showed an attempted forward-driven message of what he would aim to accomplish with a second term. The former president has often pushed back on that advice, arguing that his message is strong enough as it is, and one source close to him told CNN his proclivity for focusing on the 2020 election will be tough to break because he still regularly hears from members of his base who believe so-called election integrity is an important talking point as he seeks reelection.  Another adviser said that despite the defeat of several Trump-backed midterm candidates who denied the legitimacy of the 2020 election, Trump has said he does not believe their losses were tied to their election lies.","{'neg': 0.372, 'neu': 0.628, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.7964}",11,186.0,0.1254,0.8342,0.040400000000000005,-0.35351999999999995,0.083,0.86,0.057,-0.9014,-3.8887199999999993,-11.946511666666641,207.0,-0.05771261674718184
Second Trump attorney met with Mar-A-Lago probe grand jury in recent weeks,2023-02-11,"Trump attorney Christina Bobb appeared before a federal grand jury in Washington, DC, in recent weeks in connection with the investigation into former President Donald Trump's handling of classified documents, two sources have told CNN. Bobb's appearance marks the second Trump lawyer involved with Trump's handling of government documents to meet with the grand jury recently. CNN reported that Trump attorney Evan Corcoran appeared before the grand jury last month.  The Wall Street Journal first reported Bobb's appearance. The move by special counsel Jack Smith to compel both Bobb and Corcoran to testify is an aggressive one, given that they both are lawyers to the former president. But it also marks how the investigation continues to push for answers on the lead-up to the August 2022 FBI search of Mar-a-Lago in the document-mishandling and obstruction of justice investigation.  The two attorneys were involved in responding to the Justice Department on behalf of Trump, at a time when all classified records in his possession had been subpoenaed yet hundreds were not turned over. Corcoran and Bobb each had a role in telling prosecutors in writing that the Trump team had searched for documents and turned over all classified material in his possession last June. A lawyer for Bobb declined to comment on her interactions with the special counsel's investigation. The disclosure of the testimony also comes amid an escalation of activity in Smith's other Trump probe, looking into the attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, and efforts to impede the transfer of power following the 2020 election.  Smith issued a subpoena in that investigation to former Vice President Mike Pence in recent days, seeking documents and testimony. Trump's former national security adviser Robert O'Brien also received a subpoena, as CNN first reported.

FBI removes one document marked classified from former Vice President Mike Pence's home,2023-02-10,"A document with classified markings was removed from former Vice President Mike Pence's Indiana home Friday during a search by the FBI, according to Pence spokesman Devin O'Malley. Six ""additional pages without such markings that were not discovered in the initial review by the vice president's counsel"" were also removed, O'Malley said. Pence is currently on the West Coast with his family after the birth of two grandchildren, according to his spokesperson. The FBI is also expected to search Pence's office in Washington, DC, in the coming days, sources told CNN. The search comes after the FBI and the Justice Department's National Security Division launched a review of the documents and how they ended up in Pence's house. It is not yet clear what the documents are related to or their level of sensitivity or classification.  On Thursday, Pence was also subpoenaed by special counsel Jack Smith, who is investigating former President Donald Trump and his role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection. Trump's legal team is expected to assert executive privilege over some aspects of Pence's subpoenaed testimony, according to a source familiar with the legal strategy.  The Pence team, in talks with the Justice Department ahead of the search, expressed that they wanted to completely cooperate. The Pence team does not believe there are classified documents either at his home or at his office as they conducted what they considered an extensive search themselves, a source said.  Pence has previously acknowledged that ""mistakes were made,"" as he took responsibility for classified documents ending up in his home and pledged to would ""fully cooperate"" with any FBI investigation. He said that the found documents had been ""immediately"" secured and the National Archives was notified.  CNN first reported last month that Pence had discovered classified documents at his Carmel, Indiana, home after he instructed an attorney to search his records out of an ""abundance of caution"" following news of Biden's classified documents. His attorney, Matt Morgan, found about a dozen documents marked as classified in four boxes that came from Pence's vice presidential residence and his White House office.  Pence's team notified the Archives of the discovery, and Archives officials notified the FBI. The FBI requested that Pence immediately turn over the classified documents and he agreed. The four boxes of unclassified material was driven to Washington so the Archives could review it for compliance with the Presidential Records Act, the law that requires all presidential documents are handed over to the Archives at the end of an administration.  The roughly 12 classified documents included materials described as background briefing memos that were prepared for Pence's foreign trips, and sources described the classification markings as on the ""lower level."" The boxes in question had not gone through the thorough procedures Pence's office had in place for documents because they were packed at the last minute, sources said.  Biden's team discovered classified documents at his Washington, DC, think tank office in November. Biden has said they immediately notified the National Archives, which then notified DOJ, but the discovery was not made public for weeks. Materials were also found at Biden's Wilmington, Delaware, residence. On Wednesday, FBI agents also searched Biden's home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, and did not discover any additional classified documents.  The FBI retrieved hundreds of documents from Trump's Florida residence last August after he failed to comply with a subpoena to hand over classified material. Trump had more than 300 classified documents in his possession at Mar-a-Lago that were turned over to the Archives and retrieved by the FBI.

Trump attorney appeared before federal grand jury in Mar-a-Lago probe,2023-02-11,"Donald Trump attorney Evan Corcoran appeared last month to testify before a federal grand jury in Washington, DC, that's looking at the former president's handling of national security records at his Mar-a-Lago residence, a source confirmed to CNN. He was there for roughly four hours. Bloomberg first reported that he had appeared. Prosecutors asked Corcoran about what had occurred up until the August 8, 2022, search of Mar-a-Lago, which came after investigators found evidence that made them believe classified records kept at the Florida resort were moved and concealed -- including questions about his interactions with Trump, another person familiar with the situation said. The disclosure of Corcoran's testimony comes amid a steady drip of recent moves by special counsel Jack Smith to obtain grand jury testimony from very close contacts of Trump, in many cases about what Trump was told and what he said at the end of his presidency and afterward. It also comes amid an escalation of activity in Smith's other Trump probe, looking into January 6, 2021, and efforts to impede the transfer of power following the 2020 election. Smith issued a subpoena in that investigation to former Vice President Mike Pence in recent days, seeking documents and testimony. Trump's former national security adviser Robert O'Brien also received a subpoena, as CNN first reported. Corcoran declined to answer some questions in the grand jury that would have divulged his advice to Trump and their conversations, citing attorney-client privilege, the person familiar added. The Justice Department has repeatedly tried in the investigation to force witnesses to answer questions they declined to respond to in the grand jury, but the courts will ultimately have to decide if Corcoran must say more. As one of Trump's primary criminal defense lawyers since he left the presidency, Corcoran has been in touch with federal investigators and the National Archives for much of the course of the Mar-a-Lago documents investigation. He had drafted a letter signed by another attorney last June that said Trump's team had done a diligent search and turned over classified records in their possession. Even still, the DOJ believed its investigation was being obstructed, prompting investigators to obtain a search warrant from a court in August.  Hundreds more records with classified markings were found, with additional being turned over by Trump's lawyers to the DOJ in the past few months.

Trump team turns over additional classified records and laptop to federal prosecutors,2023-02-10,"Former President Donald Trump's legal team turned over more materials with classified markings and a laptop belonging to an aide to federal prosecutors in recent months, multiple sources familiar with the investigation told CNN. The Trump attorneys also handed over an empty folder marked ""Classified Evening Briefing,"" sources said. The previously undisclosed handovers -- from December and January -- suggest the protracted effort by the Justice Department to repossess records from Trump's presidency may not be done. The Trump attorneys discovered pages with classified markings in December, while searching through boxes at the former president's Mar-a-Lago residence. The lawyers subsequently handed the materials over to the Justice Department. A Trump aide had previously copied those same pages onto a thumb drive and laptop, not realizing they were classified, sources said. The laptop, which belonged to an aide, who works for Save America PAC, and the thumb drive were also given to investigators in January. Special counsel Jack Smith's investigation, which is pursuing possible criminal charges related to Trump's handling of national security records and obstruction of justice, had subpoenaed Trump last May for all classified records in his possession. FBI agents seized classified documents and other presidential records during a search last August. The Trump team also found additional documents in a Florida storage facility and turned them over to the FBI.  The discovery of two documents with classified markings in the storage unit was made after a team hired by Trump's lawyers searched it along with three other Trump properties: Trump Tower in New York, the Bedminster golf club and an office location in Florida. Those four searches came amid lingering concerns from the Justice Department that not all of the documents from Trump's time in the White House had been returned to the federal government.

White House says Biden's Super Bowl interview with Fox is off,2023-02-10,"The White House says President Joe Biden will not sit down for an interview with Fox before the Super Bowl, ending a strange back and forth between the Biden administration and the television network with which it frequently spars. Earlier Friday, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Fox had pulled the plug on the administration's proposal to give an interview with Fox Soul, a small streaming platform aimed at Black Americans.  ""The President was looking forward to an interview with Fox Soul to discuss the Super Bowl, the State of the Union, and critical issues impacting the everyday lives of Black Americans. We've been informed that Fox Corp has asked for the interview to be cancelled,"" Jean-Pierre said in a tweet Friday. Hours later, Fox said it would interview the president after all, claiming there had been a mixup with the White House. Fox said its reporters had flown to Washington from Los Angeles earlier in the day to conduct the interview.  But Friday night, the administration said the interview was still off. ""As we said earlier, we had arranged an interview with Fox Sports Host Mike Hill & Vivica A. Fox with the President ahead of the Super Bowl and Fox Corp had the interview cancelled,"" a White House spokesperson told CNN. ""Fox has since put out a statement indicating the interview was rescheduled, which is inaccurate."" Typically, such interviews are pre-taped on the Friday before the Super Bowl with the network airing the event.  For weeks, Fox News had been seeking an interview with Biden. But the White House never committed to one with the right-wing channel, with which the White House has a contentious relationship. Instead, the White House attempted to circumvent Fox News by trying to set up an interview with Fox Soul. An interview with the Fox Soul network could have allowed the White House a workaround to still participate in the traditional pre-game conversation with a Fox-aligned outlet without having to sit with one of Fox News' anchors or reporters.  Biden's Fox News snub was the latest example of the Democratic president continuing to ice out the right-wing channel and decline requests to sit down with its hosts and anchors. Biden has not granted Fox News a single interview during his presidency, despite the network repeatedly asking. The channel portrays him and his administration in a negative light, with far-right personalities such as Tucker Carlson regularly launching vicious attacks on Biden. Fox Corp. on Thursday had not been formally turned down, but was ""operating like it's not happening,"" according to a person familiar with the matter at Fox News, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the interview. Biden sat down for two television interviews earlier in the week, one with PBS NewsHour and another with Telemundo, which makes the snub all the more notable. There is some recent precedent for declining the traditional pre-Super Bowl interview. President Donald Trump, who villainized the press with lies and smears, declined to sit down with anchor Lester Holt when NBC hosted the Super Bowl in 2018. If Biden were to have done an interview with Fox News ahead of the Super Bowl, it would almost certainly have been with Bret Baier, who is a generally respected, traditional news anchor. It's not just the right-wing commentators at Fox News with whom Biden has taken issue. The president has even tangled with Fox News' reporters, calling Peter Doocy, its White House correspondent, a ""stupid son of a bitch"" last year. Biden later called Doocy to apologize.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.719, 'pos': 0.281, 'compound': 0.5994}",24,191.0,0.04,0.774,0.186,0.8809,0.068,0.871,0.061,-0.4802,21.1416,42.79698333333336,91.0,0.4702965201465204
Lula says Brazil is no more divided than the US as he meets Biden,2023-02-10,"Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said the divisions in his country were no worse than the political split in the United States, in an exclusive CNN interview Friday ahead of his meeting with President Joe Biden at the White House. ""Here there's also a split, much more, or as serious as Brazil -- Democrats and Republicans are very split up. Love it or leave it, that's more or less what's going on,"" he told CNN's Christiane Amanpour in Washington, adding that Brazil does not have ""a hatred culture."" Both Lula and Biden saw government buildings sacked in the aftermath of their presidential elections by far-right elements that have posed huge tests for their respective democracies. ""Never could we imagine that in a country that was the symbol of democracy in the world -- someone could try to invade the Capitol,"" he said about the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot in the US.  The similarities between the January 8 attack on Brasilia and the US insurrection include former President Jair Bolsonaro's close alignment with former US President Donald Trump.  Lula calls Bolsonaro a ""faithful copycat of Trump,"" saying both men ""don't enjoy trade unions... They don't like workers, don't like women. They don't like Black people."" Both ex-leaders were repeatedly criticized during their terms for using racist and misogynistic language. Even so, Lula is not convinced all Bolsonaro supporters are adherents to his views. ""I am convinced that not everybody that voted for Bolsonaro follows Bolsonarism,"" he said.   After his election loss, Bolsonaro decamped for the United States. He has been living near Orlando, Florida, for more than a month, prompting some Democratic Party lawmakers to call for him to leave the country.  Will Lula ask Biden to help extradite Bolsonaro back to Brazil? ""I don't know, I'm not going to talk about President Biden about that, this will depend on courts,"" he replied. ""One day he has to come back to Brazil and face all the lawsuits against him."" Bolsonaro faces ""almost 12 lawsuits against him in Brazil, more cases will come in,"" Lula said, adding that he believes his former rival will ""be convicted in some international court because of the genocide with Covid (outbreak) because half of the people that died in Brazil during Covid was the responsibility of the federal government.""  He also alleged that Bolsonaro could be ""punished"" by courts for ""the genocide against the Yanomami indigenous people"" after illegal mining in their protected territory soared during his term.  Brazil's Supreme Court has ordered an investigation to determine whether the actions of the Bolsonaro government amounted to ""genocide"" of the Yanomami -- who have seen disease and malnutrition tear through their community in the last four years.  Bolsonaro has previously called such accusation a ""left-wing farce"" on his official Telegram channel.  Biden talks Lula's talks with Biden on Friday are expected to center around combating climate change and tackling anti-democratic extremism. While Lula believes ""democracy will prevail"" in Brazil, he worries about about the rise of extreme right groups around the world. ""It's in Brazil, it's in Spain, it's in France, and they are in Hungary, in Germany. We have an organized extreme right in the world and if we're not careful, this will be a Nazi attitude from there. This is a denial attitude we haven't seen before,"" he said. He agrees there is much to be done in Brazil about the climate, saying the country's commitment to ""reduce greenhouse emissions"" by 39% would have to include rewarding local ""mayors and governors, who guarantee no more burning of the forests."" By extending an early invitation to Lula to visit the White House, Biden hopes to cultivate closer ties and demonstrate his support for one of the Western Hemisphere's key players. Biden quickly called Lula following his victory late last year, hoping to demonstrate support after Bolsonaro had laid the groundwork to question the election results. The move was received well among Lula's officials, who saw it as a sign Biden was looking to restore US-Brazil ties. They have met previously -- when Biden was vice president, he met Lula on the sidelines of a gathering in Chile. But as counterparts, they will look to deepen what has traditionally been a key bilateral relationship in the Western Hemisphere, strained in recent years by the diametrically opposed Biden and Bolsonaro. While they have much in common, Lula -- like many leaders in middle income and developing countries -- has adopted a policy of non-intervention over the war in Ukraine. He has rebuffed efforts led by Biden to unite the global community in opposition to Russia's invasion.  Speaking to CNN, Lula said that Ukraine had the right to defend itself ""because the invasion was a mistake on the part of Russia.""  He explained he refused to provide ammunition to Ukraine because, ""I don't want to go join the war. I want to end the war.""  Lula has sought be a global statesman who could broker a truce between Russia and Ukraine, telling CNN that he has begun this ""work"" by speaking to the German Chancellor, who visited Brazil in January.  ""I want to talk about peace with (Russian President Vladimir) Putin. I want to talk about peace with President Biden, I want to talk about peace with (Chinese leader) Xi Jinping. I want to talk about peace with India, with Indonesia... because for me the world will only develop itself if we have peace,"" he said.  Another thing Lula shares with Biden is age. They are both elderly presidents: Biden is 80 years old, while Lula is 77.  When asked about it, Lula said aging only exists for those who don't have a cause to fight for.  ""I am 77 years of age, and ... I have the energy and power of someone who is 30 years old,"" he said. ""I don't sleep because my home is the Brazilian people -- I have to improve the lives of my people.""

Democracy on the agenda as Biden meets Brazil's Lula at the White House,2023-02-10,"When Brazil's new president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, met President Joe Biden at the White House on Friday, the two hoped to reset relations after an era defined by right-wing populists and threats to democracy in both nations. The talks, expected to center around efforts to combat climate change and tackle anti-democratic extremism, came roughly a month after protesters aligned with far-right former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro stormed government institutions in Brasilia following Bolsonaro's election loss. ""Both of our nations' strong democracies have been tested of late, very much tested, and our institutions put in jeopardy,"" Biden told Lula in the Oval Office on Friday. ""But in both the United States and Brazil, democracy prevailed."" The event carried troubling echoes of the US insurrection attempt on January 6, 2021, not least because Bolsonaro was closely aligned with former US President Donald Trump. After his election loss, Bolsonaro decamped for the United States; he has been living near Orlando, Florida, for more than a month. ""To defend democracy is an obligation of all democrats in the world,"" Lula told CNN's Chief International Anchor Christiane Amanpour in an interview in Washington. ""I (could never) have imagined that it could happen in US, in North America, the invasion of the Capitol. As I never could imagine that in Brazil, after a democratic procession with elections, we could have an invasion of the Congress, the supreme court and the presidential palace."" ""This means that you have an extreme right running around the world, an extreme right that is very nervous and that uses fake news as if it was a tool to develop politics and to talk to people, to communicate with people,"" he went on. ""And we have to destroy, you know, this narrative that they use against the democrats."" For Biden, the episode was another sign that protecting democracy is a global imperative. By extending an early invitation to Lula to visit the White House, Biden hoped to cultivate closer ties and demonstrate his support for one of the Western Hemisphere's key players. Biden quickly called Lula following his victory late last year, hoping to demonstrate support after Bolsonaro had laid the groundwork to question the election results. The move was received well among Lula's officials, who saw it as a sign Biden was looking to restore US-Brazil ties. Biden largely iced Bolsonaro out, engaging with him only sparingly. With the left-wing Lula, he finds more of an ideological ally. They have met previously; when Biden was vice president, he met Lula on the sidelines of a gathering in Chile. But as counterparts, they will look to deepen what has traditionally been a key bilateral relationship in the Western Hemisphere, strained in recent years by the diametrically opposed Biden and Bolsonaro. Rebuilding those bonds, and affirming a commitment to democracy, was key in their first face-to-face meeting. ""I affirm the United States' unwavering support for Brazil's democracy, and respect for the free will of the Brazilian people,"" Biden said Friday. ""We reject political violence."" Hanging over the meeting was Bolsonaro's continued presence in the United States. Bolsonaro is seeking a six-month tourist visa to remain in the US, the law firm representing Bolsonaro confirmed to CNN Brasil on January 30. The US State Department has refused to confirm Bolsonaro's visa status due to confidentiality. Bolsonaro has been in Florida since December 30, leaving Brazil days before the January 1 inauguration of his successor. His presence in Florida has drawn criticism by House Democrats, who in mid-January urged Biden not to ""provide shelter"" for Bolsonaro in the wake of his supporters storming Brazil's democratic institutions in the capital Brasília. Lula told Amanpour there was ""no chance for (Bolsonaro) to come back to the presidency of the republic."" Ahead of Friday's visit, a US official said Biden was prepared to discuss ""any issue"" that Lula wanted, but suggested they did not expect Bolsonaro's status in the United States to arise. The official said they were unaware of any formal extradition requests related to Bolsonaro. ""If and when we receive one, I know we will give it the deserving response,"" the official said. Instead, officials described an agenda focused mainly on areas of agreement, though on Ukraine there could be some dissension. Atop the agenda was climate change, which has already been the primary focus of their two phone calls. When he was in office, Bolsonaro sped up deforestation of the Amazon. Lula has vowed to protect the forest and advance efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions. They were also expected to discuss ways to bolster democracy and efforts inside both countries to advance human rights, social inclusion, gender equality and safeguarding LGBTQ rights, a senior US administration official said. Other topics on the agenda included economic matters and an early conversation about Brazil's 2024 presidency of the G20. An area they may not be as closely aligned is on Ukraine. Lula has adopted a policy of non-intervention, rebuffing efforts led by Biden to united the global community in opposition to Russia's invasion. Lula was expected to propose a ""peace club"" meant to negotiate an end to the war, including countries like China and India that haven't taken as firm a stance in opposition to the invasion. Biden is ""looking forward"" to hearing out Lula's proposals for Ukraine, the senior administration official said, and the US will ""respect and support efforts by Lula to promote dialogue and peace."" Biden welcomes Lula's readiness to to reengage on the global stage, the official said. Still, the official acknowledged Biden and Lula ""may not always agree on everything"" but have a shared interest in ensuring peace.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",42,193.0,0.119,0.881,0.0,-0.5423,0.051,0.819,0.13,0.9979,-22.776600000000002,-12.138283333333309,138.0,-0.08795857487922687
Border crossings in January drop to lowest point since February 2021,2023-02-10,"The number of unlawful crossings of the US-Mexico border in January marked the lowest levels of encounters since February 2021, administration officials said Friday. In January, US Border Patrol made more than 128,000 apprehensions, down 42% from December, according to administration officials. The handling of the US-Mexico border has been a political vulnerability for President Joe Biden, who faces criticism from Republicans and potential impeachment proceedings of his Homeland Security secretary. The White House has generally kept the issue at arms length but the drop in border crossings has instilled renewed confidence in administration officials who say new measures are helping drive the decline. In recent weeks, administration officials have cited a new program that provides a legal pathway to the United States as contributing to a drop in border crossings. Encounters with migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela -- the four nationalities that benefit from that program -- have declined dramatically, officials said. ""Since the president announced our new border approach on January 5, the number of unlawful border crossings has plummeted,"" an administration official told reporters Friday, adding that there's also been a significant drop in migrants from Central America. Border numbers often fluctuate depending on circumstances in the Western Hemisphere, so it's unclear how long the trend will hold. The administration also continues to rely on a Trump-era Covid restriction, known as Title 42, that allows authorities to turn away certain migrants at the US-Mexico border, though it could expire soon. But officials cited new measures, like the new program and use of an app for processing, along with coordination with Mexico as contributing to the decline in encounters.","{'neg': 0.343, 'neu': 0.657, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.5719}",10,194.0,0.063,0.873,0.063,0.0,0.068,0.833,0.098,0.869,0.0,-17.900083333333306,133.0,-0.13458709273182937
Opinion: Former Manhattan prosecutor has given Trump a gift,2023-02-10,"When it comes to the unfortunate fight between former prosecutor Mark Pomerantz and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, the outcome is now clear. Pomerantz is the loser. And former President Donald Trump is the likely winner.  In February 2021, Mark Pomerantz, a very experienced former federal prosecutor, joined former Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance's office and led the criminal investigations into former President Donald Trump's financial dealings.  Before Vance retired at the end of 2021, the Manhattan DA's office indicted two Trump Organization companies, along with its Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg, on multiple charges of criminal tax fraud and falsifying business records. In December 2022, a jury found Trump Corp. and Trump Payroll Corp. guilty on all counts. Weisselberg, who struck a plea deal with the prosecutors, was sentenced in January to five months in jail. By 2022, Pomerantz thought his team had sufficient evidence to file felony charges against Trump in a separate case. But Bragg, the new DA who succeeded Vance, was concerned there wasn't enough evidence to make the case that Trump intended to break the law.   Pomerantz ended up resigning in a public, noisy fashion, writing, ""I believe that your decision not to prosecute Donald Trump now, and on the existing record, is misguided and completely contrary to the public interest."" And now, Pomerantz has written a book about the case.  The gist of Pomerantz's claim is that he had assembled a strong criminal case against Trump, but Bragg lacked enthusiasm, and possibly the courage, to bring it. Bragg, for his part, has said that the case was not ready in early 2022 but that the investigation is still ongoing. The Manhattan DA's office recently impaneled a grand jury and began presenting evidence about Trump's alleged role in a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels. (Trump has denied the affair with Daniels, and any wrongdoing.) Bragg's office also alleges that Pomerantz's public disclosure of investigative details and inner deliberations of the office violate Pomerantz's confidentiality obligations and may harm the case.  A lot of ink has been spilled about the Bragg/Pomerantz affair. I won't rehash all the details here, although I will note that the more that comes out, the more it looks like Bragg has the better of the arguments about the readiness of Pomerantz's case and the strength of his legal theories. The truth is that so many things about charging Trump would be unprecedented and therefore subject to legal uncertainty; under these circumstances, making sure the evidence is strong and the legal theory is solid before proceeding with charges is eminently reasonable.  In any case, Pomerantz has done something worse than being overly aggressive in pushing for charges in internal meetings. Because, putting aside rank corruption or extreme incompetence — which absolutely no one alleges here — a prosecutor should never, ever, disclose anything about a pending investigation that could jeopardize that investigation. Pomerantz's actions have led to the disclosure of significant information about the DA's investigation, the evidence it gathered, the charges under consideration, the legal theories that some prosecutors favored, and the sometimes contradictory views of all of those things among different lawyers within the office. Pomerantz has also criticized the office's lawyers and questioned their legal abilities.  Legal experts have opined that Pomerantz's statements about the investigation may have violated his duty of confidentiality, his obligations under the legal ethics code and potentially even the criminal grand jury secrecy rules. (Pomerantz said in a statement, ""I am confident that all of my actions with respect to the Trump investigation, including the writing of my forthcoming book, are consistent with my legal and ethical obligations."") But equally bad, in my view, is that Pomerantz has given Trump a gift. To be clear, even without Pomerantz's revelations, a Trump defense would be sure to include claims of selective and vindictive prosecution — it has become a standard response from Trump to play the victim. And Trump, if charged, will undoubtedly attack the legal theory put forward by prosecutors, particularly any novel applications of New York law. But now those claims will carry more weight due to the revelations of former prosecution team member Pomerantz and what we know about the infighting among the prosecutors themselves. The irony is that the thing that Pomerantz claimed he wanted most in his resignation letter was for Trump to be held accountable. And yet the end result of this campaign of Pomerantz's may be to make it less, not more, likely that accountability in the form of a conviction of Trump ever comes to pass. For any true prosecutor, that's a terrible thing.

Congressman who raised issue of antisemitism on Twitter says he was bombarded with antisemitic tweets,2023-02-10,"A Jewish lawmaker who spoke about the problem of antisemitism on Twitter during a House Oversight hearing this week focused on the company was later bombarded with antisemitic messages on the platform, he explained in a letter to new owner Elon Musk on Thursday. ""What happened on Twitter directly after the hearing proves my exact point that antisemitism is real and Twitter has become a hate-filled playground for Nazis and anti-Semites,"" Rep. Jared Moskowitz told CNN about the hateful comments he received. At the hearing on Wednesday, which focused on Twitter's handling of a New York Post story about Hunter Biden's laptop in the leadup to the 2020 election, the Florida Democrat criticized his Republican counterparts for saying ""God bless Elon Musk."" Moskowitz asked: ""God bless the guys who is allowing Nazis and antisemitism to perpetuate on Twitter?"" He also cited statistics from the Anti-Defamation League, stating there has been a more than 60% increase in antisemitic comments on Twitter since Musk took over the platform. Under Musk's leadership, Twitter has slashed its staff, relaxed some of its content moderation policies and reinstated a number of incendiary accounts that were previously banned. Those moves raised concerns that Musk's Twitter could contribute to a rise in public displays of hate and antisemitism offline.  Musk, however, has repeatedly pushed back at claims that hate speech is rising on the platform. In December, for example, Musk claimed ""hate speech impressions,"" or the number of times a tweet containing hate speech has been viewed, ""continue to decline"" since his early days of owning the company. Twitter, which eliminated much of its public relations team during last year's layoffs, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Moskowitz and many other Democrats on the subpanel used their allotted time to grill the former Twitter executives testifying at the hearing about the company's policies for policing hate on the platform. During his questioning, Moskowitz also rebuked former President Donald Trump for hosting white nationalist and Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes at Mar-a-Lago last year. He brought a large copy of a hateful post that Fuentes had tweeted at Moskowitz, telling the room, ""No, not all Republicans are Nazis, but I gotta tell you, Nazis seem really comfortable with Donald Trump. So I have questions about that.""  In his letter to Musk, Moskowitz said he shared a clip showing his line of questioning on his official government Twitter account, after which ""the reply section of my post was flooded with hateful, antisemitic comments and images."" He added: ""At the time that I am writing this letter, I have received over 200 such comments on one tweet. This does not include other posts of mine that have since received antisemitic comments, including a video honoring the victims of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas shooting."" Moskowitz pointed to a November 30 National Terrorism Advisory System Bulletin warning from the Department of Homeland Security, which ""issued domestic terror threats to multiple groups, including the Jewish community,"" as evidence of his heightened concern. ""DHS notes that threat actors have recently mobilized to violence, and there is an 'enduring threat' to the Jewish community,"" he writes. ""With this direct and heightened threat environment in mind, how will you work with other stakeholders to combat the rise of antisemitism on Twitter?,"" Moskowitz concludes in his letter to Musk. Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, echoed Moskowitz's concerns. ""Antisemitism has no place on any social media platform that doesn't want to further the harassment and exclusion of marginalized communities,"" Greenblatt told CNN Thursday. ""While Twitter ostensibly has an anti-hate policy that includes antisemitism, it is unclear the degree to which it is being enforced."" Greenblatt said the ADL continues to flag ""batches of antisemitic content"" to Twitter, but he said the company has only taken action on ""a fraction of them"" since Musk acquired the company. He also raised concerns about the staff cuts and the reinstated accounts that were banned previously.  ""These findings, combined with Twitter gutting its trust and safety operations, suggest serious issues will continue to persist on the platform as it pertains to effective content moderation and the proliferation of antisemitism,"" Greenblatt said.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",26,196.0,0.106,0.8294999999999999,0.0645,0.07200000000000001,0.129,0.813,0.058,-0.9948,1.8720000000000003,-40.11559999999997,154.0,-0.2604909090909089
Why Biden shouldn't dismiss his negative poll numbers,2023-02-10,"President Joe Biden says he's not ready to make a decision on whether to run for reelection. He did, however, dismiss polls that have cast a negative light on his 2024 chances, telling Telemundo, ""Do you know any polling that's accurate these days?"" Biden is upset because of recent polling findings that a lot of Democrats would be happy if he didn't run and that put former President Donald Trump ahead of Biden (though within the margin of error) in a hypothetical 2024 contest.   To be clear, I believe Biden would very likely win the Democratic nomination and would have a good chance of winning a general election. But I have to defend the polling he went after.  Surveys are tools of the current moment (not fortune tellers), and those tools have, on the whole, done a good job of forecasting Biden's and the Democratic Party's political fates over the past few years.   Let's start with the most recent election, when polling supposedly did poorly. It is true that some surveys underestimated Democratic candidates. The polls that meet CNN's standards for publication, however, were quite good.  The national surveys looking at the generic congressional ballot had Republicans ahead by about 1.5 points over the last 21 days of the campaign. Republicans ended up winning the national House vote by a little less than 3 points. If you take out uncontested races -- more Republicans than Democrats were unopposed in House contests last year -- the final margin would probably have been closer to a 2-point Republican edge.  An error of less than 2 points (or 1 point) is really good. The 2022 state-level polling was also above par. The average miss for gubernatorial elections was about 3 points, while it was less than 2.5 points in US Senate races. The previous average polling miss since 1998 had been above 5 points.  Comparisons with 2020 polling Polling in 2020, of course, consistently showed Biden ahead of Trump. While those polls were too friendly to Biden and Democrats, they accurately showed them winning the election that November.  Multiple surveys since last year have shown Trump ahead of Biden in a potential 2024 election. Some polls also have Biden trailing Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. Over the entire 2020 campaign, not a single reputable poll found Trump ahead of Biden. Quite simply, the polling today looks nothing like it did when Biden won his first term. If anything, it looks considerably worse for him.  The good news for Biden is that the general election is almost two years away, and the polling could change considerably. Even general election polls at this point are mostly within the margin of error, on average.  With inflation calming and gas prices much lower than they were over much of last summer, you could easily see Biden's poll numbers improving.  I would point out as well that Biden is probably in better shape than the surveys indicating Democrats don't want him running again would suggest. The simple reason is that politics doesn't happen in a vacuum. Unless it's a California recall election, most voters don't cast ballots saying ""yes"" or ""no"" to a single politician. They have to choose between different candidates.  The limited polling that tests Biden against other Democrats for 2024 has him well ahead nationally. That may be part of the reason why no serious challengers to the president have emerged.  Remember, it was this same national primary polling that was an early sign of Biden's strength in the 2020 Democratic primary. He maintained his lead for almost the entire primary process, even as a lot of people were willing to dismiss him.  The bottom line is that I wouldn't count Biden out going into 2024. Beating an incumbent president isn't easy. The majority do win reelection when they run.  Still, Biden's negative polling is most likely an accurate depiction of where the electorate stands right now.

"Exclusive: US developed method to track China's spy balloon fleet within last year, sources say",2023-02-10,"The US intelligence community has developed a method to track China's fleet of surveillance balloons that was only discovered within the last year, six people familiar with the matter tell CNN. After President Joe Biden took office in 2021, a Chinese spy balloon briefly transited the continental United States, as administration officials have acknowledged. Afterwards, the intelligence community ran some of the balloon's signals through the US' intelligence holdings and other data to see where and when they may have popped up in the past.  The findings have allowed the US to develop a consistent technical method for the first time that they have used to track the balloons in near-real time across the globe, the sources said. The existence of this method could further inflame criticism from Republican lawmakers that the administration didn't act quickly enough to prevent the balloon from entering US airspace last week. Officials were also able to use the information collected from the earlier balloon alongside other sources to discover that similar surveillance balloons had transited US territory undetected at least three times under the Trump administration. Officials declined to say how the signals were collected, and it is not clear how long it took the intelligence community to develop the new method, which was first used in 2022.  But the new method is important because the balloons are extremely difficult to track without it -- they are slow-moving and can fly extremely high, in some cases as high as much as 60 miles up, and can evade the more traditional radars that are oriented toward detecting fast-moving missiles and counterterrorism threats, a lawmaker familiar with the intelligence told CNN. Officials emphasized that the balloon's signals were an important key to discovering a tracking method, but not the only piece of the puzzle. One Defense Department official described the process by which the US was able to identify past instances of these so-called high-altitude balloons -- what the Pentagon now refers to as HABs -- as ""piecing together'' different clues from different sources of intelligence. ""We were able to go back and look at the historical patterns"" of the balloons,"" national security adviser Jake Sullivan said this week. ""And that led us to come to understand that during the Trump administration, there were multiple instances where the surveillance balloons traversed American airspace and American territory."" The revelation that the intelligence community only within the last year developed a reliable way to track China's balloon fleet -- which officials now say has flown dozens of missions worldwide -- helps explain why Trump administration officials have stridently claimed to have had no knowledge of the three alleged flights over US territory during the former president's time in office. Senior Trump administration officials including former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, former Secretary of State and CIA Director Mike Pompeo, as well as ex- national security adviser John Bolton have all said they were not notified that Chinese balloons entered US airspace under the last administration. A broader understanding of the Chinese fleet The tracking method provided an important tool as US officials monitored the latest balloon to transit the continental United States, gathering intelligence on it as it crossed the country before it was ultimately shot down off the coast of South Carolina last Saturday. ""This last week provided the United States with a unique opportunity to learn a lot more about the Chinese surveillance balloon program, all information that will help us to continue to track these kinds of objects,"" Pentagon spokesman Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said on Wednesday.  And it has allowed the US to keep an eye on other Chinese spy balloons around the globe. Another balloon, in South America, recently went down in the ocean to the east of the continent -- although at this point, US officials tell CNN, they aren't entirely sure what happened. Three US officials familiar with the intelligence say that the US still isn't certain whether some of these balloons are equipped with a self-destruct mechanism.  The US' ability to track the balloons' whereabouts has also added to the broader understanding of how large China's balloon surveillance program actually is.  On Thursday, officials revealed that they believe the spy balloons the US has discovered are part of a large fleet that is conducting surveillance operations globally on behalf of China's military, the People's Liberation Army. So far, the US has traced the balloons to 40 countries across five continents, officials said.  A 2022 military intelligence report obtained by CNN said a balloon was tracked near Guam as far back as 2019. A former government official investigating strange aerial sightings by Navy pilots over recent years  -- some of which government officials have said have turned out to be balloons -- described a meeting several months ago where a defense official ""pulled out of his pocket a piece of a Chinese balloon with Chinese writing on it."" ""The point is, it's not new that there are Chinese balloons,"" the former official told CNN. The US was able to track the latest balloon's path even before it entered US airspace. The Defense Intelligence Agency warned that the balloon was headed for the US on January 27, one day before it entered the country over Alaska, officials told CNN.  But military and intelligence officials believed the best course of action would be to continue tracking the balloon and collect intelligence on it, as it was not deemed a threat as it crossed over the US and shooting it down would risk civilian lives and reduce the chances of recovering the balloon's equipment intact.  US officials briefed members of Congress on Thursday that the balloon had the ability to collect so-called ""signals intelligence"" and transmit data to the mainland of China -- but that it appeared to stop transmitting once the US learned about it, limiting how much intelligence it was able to gather on behalf of Beijing, according to sources familiar with the briefing. The US also understands that China is using the balloons for surveillance based on ""high-resolution imagery"" taken by reconnaissance planes as they flew past the balloon that flew over the US last week. ""We know the PRC used these balloons for surveillance,"" an official said. ""High-resolution imagery from U-2 flybys revealed that the high-altitude balloon was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.""

Shinzo Abe exposes Trump's thought process ahead of US-North Korea summit in posthumous memoir,2023-02-10,"Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe urged then-President Donald Trump not to relent with North Korea and to keep up the threat of military pressure, according to his memoir. In his posthumously published book ""Abe Shinzo: Kaikoroku,"" Abe details his meetings with Trump and exposes the then-president's thought process when it came to negotiations with North Korea and strategic defense matters in Asia.  ""I kept telling him, 'What Kim Jong Un fears most is that suddenly a Tomahawk shot will cost him his life, his family's life. I kept telling Trump that only the US can put pressure on him to use force,'"" Abe writes in his Japanese language memoir, according to an English translation.  Abe recalled that there were concerns that Trump would convey to Kim, the North Korean leader, that he was reluctant to take military action, and both Abe and Trump's national security team were keen to make sure that the world did not find out about it. ""If Kim Jong Un finds out that Trump is someone who is reluctant to take military action, then the pressure will be off. So we had to make absolutely sure that the outside world was not aware of it. We had to make the North Koreans think, 'If it comes to Trump, he'll do it.' Not only me but also the US security team was desperate to keep Trump's true nature under wraps,"" Abe writes. In his memoir, Abe shares that he told Trump that North Korea should destroy ""not only nuclear weapons but also ICBMs, medium-range missiles and biological weapons ... but he did not listen. For him, diplomacy is a new field and he has not been involved in North Korean affairs for many years. The US State Department, the White House security team and I could not stop Trump from thinking about making history."" John Bolton, who was Trump's national security adviser at the time, confirmed Abe's account and said the late prime minister repeatedly emphasized the importance of portraying a US military threat to Kim. Bolton said he and his Japanese counterpart were in regular contact throughout his tenure. ""There's no chance that you get North Korea to denuclearize if they think there's no military threat and Abe said that to Trump in every meeting he had with him,"" Bolton told CNN. ""I'm grateful for the reference, but I don't think it took us for Abe to understand what he needed to do. And he was absolutely right. Trump needed to hear it repeatedly."" Trump's team did not return request for comment.  Trump has repeatedly said that his ""maximum pressure"" strategy with North Korea is what brought Pyongyang  to the negotiating table during his presidency, though no deal on denuclearization was ever reached.      Abe said that one of Trump's powers in negotiating was that he was seen as the person on the international stage who would be most likely to use military force. ""I think people are wary that Trump is the type of person who would suddenly use military force in the international community,"" he writes. If those actions would cost the US a lot of money, though, Trump was unlikely to react the same way, according to the former prime minister.  ""He is a businessman at heart, so he was cautious about things that cost money. He thinks about diplomacy and security in terms of money,"" Abe writes.  ""When the US military dispatched an aircraft carrier strike group around the Sea of Japan in 2017, Trump initially asked me, 'Do you know how much it costs to move an aircraft carrier? I don't like it.' He said, 'I would rather keep the aircraft carrier in the military port,'"" Abe writes. Trump was also reluctant to keep funding military drills with South Korea, Abe writes, quoting Trump as saying, ""The joint military exercises between the US and South Korea cost a huge amount of money. It is a waste. It should be stopped."" Abe thought this would have an effect on negotiations at the US-North Korea summit and told Trump: ""We can't have the US troops in South Korea withdrawn, if you are going to have a US-North Korea summit."" The book -- released this week -- contains interviews that were conducted by two journalists from October 2020 to October 2021. Abe died in July 2022 after being shot while giving a campaign speech on a street in central Japan. The book was originally scheduled to be published a year ago. However, the book reveals that Abe had requested that the publication be postponed as it was too sensitive. It is said that his wife, Akie Abe, agreed to the memoir's publication.
