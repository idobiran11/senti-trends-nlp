Why Biden is only just about to face his first veto,2023-03-03,0.0,"spend some time reading about how the presidential veto has fallen into disuse and you can't help but think it coincides with an era where the filibuster and other forms of capitol hill obstruction have been put on steroids. it's an indication of how the constitutional vision of the us government -- with its separation of powers -- has contorted to what we have today, where very little can pass out of one branch of government and the executive is taking more and more power. the constitution spells out specific instructions for use of the veto as a means to separate power. the filibuster is a custom that isn't mentioned in the constitution, but has complete control over modern washington and is leaving a vacuum for presidents to fill. still, issuing a veto is a rite of passage for every modern president, and joe biden is about to experience his first. there are two issues where lawmakers from both chambers are testing biden. an effort to overturn biden's retirement investments option the first relates to a biden administration retirement investment rule, which according to cnn's report, ""allows managers of retirement funds to consider the impact of climate change and other environmental, social and governance factors when picking investments."" normally, democrats would have used filibuster rules to block action against the rule in the senate. but since lawmakers are looking to repeal an executive rule and not a law, republicans were able to vote to repeal it on wednesday with help from two red-state democrats, sens. joe manchin of west virginia and jon tester of montana. biden is expected to veto the measure, which was passed by the house on tuesday. it would take two-thirds supermajorities in both chambers (usually 67 of 100 senators and 290 of 435 representatives) to override the expected veto. taking power from the dc city council as for the second issue testing biden, there had been talk that the president could veto a bill pushed by congressional republicans to invalidate the dc city council's effort to rewrite its criminal law. critics argue the new law is soft on violent criminals. but biden told democratic senators on thursday that he won't use his veto power in this case and would sign the measure to repeal dc's new crime law. in a subsequent tweet, he noted, ""i support d.c. statehood and home-rule -- but i don't support some of the changes d.c. council put forward over the mayor's objections -- such as lowering penalties for carjackings."" what a difference four years makes regardless, it took more than two years to get to this point, when a republican-controlled house is testing biden and a slim democratic majority in the senate is unable to protect him from pulling out his veto pen. that it's taken more than two years for biden to face his first veto, after republicans took control of the house in january, is about in line with when former president donald trump issued his first veto, more than two years into his presidency. the levers of government were completely reversed back then. the republican president was usually protected by a slim republican majority in the senate from legislation passed out of a house controlled by democrats. few recent vetoes the trend away from vetoes has carried through several presidents as use of the filibuster has increased. trump threatened to veto lots of things, but he only ended up issuing 10. just one of those -- his veto of a bill to authorize defense spending -- was overridden. note: read this explanation of the difference between a regular veto and a pocket veto. the latter occurs when a president simply declines to sign a bill and congress goes into recess. but there hasn't been one of those in more than 22 years. barack obama issued 12 vetoes as president and also had one overridden. lopsided votes in the house and senate enacted a law allowing citizens to sue saudi arabia for the 9/11 attacks. george w. bush was more than five years into his presidency before he issued his first veto, but there was a flurry of activity in his final two years, when he, like obama, ultimately used his veto 12 items. unlike obama, bush had four vetoes overridden, although one of those was due to a clerical issue that required him to veto (and be overridden) twice on the same farm bill. he was also overridden by lawmakers in order to avoid a slash in payments to medicare providers. notable vetoes the first veto was issued by the first president after the first census. george washington, a southerner, opposed congress' plan to reapportion congressional seats to each state by the state's population, which would have given more seats to northern states. he issued the veto because the constitution said there shouldn't be more than one lawmaker per 30,000 people, and the plan approved by congress included eight states exceeding that ratio. thomas jefferson, who encouraged the veto, according to the national archives, ultimately devised a new plan to apportion seats based on the population as a whole. the first master of the veto was grover cleveland, who cracked down on congress' practice of acting to individually grant pensions to people who had been rejected by the department of veterans affairs. most presidents up to that point had issued either zero or a handful of vetoes. cleveland, however, issued 414 vetoes during his first term. his most notable veto was to reject crop subsidies requested by texas. only two of his hundreds of vetoes were overridden during his first term. in total, across two terms, he issued more than 580 vetoes. andrew johnson, who ascended to the presidency after abraham lincoln's death, suffered the most veto overrides: 15. it makes sense since johnson, a southern democrat, clashed with the northern republicans who controlled capitol hill at the time. the fall of the veto and the rise of obstruction the veto practice has fallen into general disuse for a number of reasons, according to steven smith, a political scientist at washington university in st. louis, who has pointed out that for starters, congress simply doesn't send as many bills to presidents as it used to. rather than congressional committees writing bills, since the mid-'90s, when then-house speaker newt gingrich squared off with then-president bill clinton, congressional leaders have taken over much of the process. that means there's more coordination between the white house and capitol hill when the same party is in control of both. the irony of obstruction when there is a split between the white house and congress, the president's allies in the senate usually offer protection. ""many of the partisan, controversial measures die in the senate before they can be sent to the president for signature or veto,"" smith wrote in his newsletter in 2021. presidents have also assumed more power from congress, giving congress less incentive to act. ""every president really in the modern era, especially in the last three or four decades, has stretched the use of unilateral action,"" smith told me on the phone, noting as an example that instead of waiting for congress, biden has tried to enact student loan debt relief on his own. while these actions are frequently challenged in court, they are rarely completely repealed. ""and because of the gridlock on capitol hill, everyone has to live with that,"" he said. congressional obstruction seems counterproductive in this way. less legislation has meant fewer vetoes, but also more power for presidents.",2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.5358594805002213,0.3674933360889554,0.09664713428355753,-0.38021092640342946,0,0,0,0,-0.7604218528068589,,,
DOJ ramps up its allegations that Texas is 'judge-shopping' in cases against Biden,2023-03-03,1.0,"the justice department is tripling down on its allegations that texas is ""judge-shopping"" in the lawsuits the state has brought against the biden administration. but the department is running into headwinds as it tries to push back against the lone star state's pattern of filing cases in a way that allows it to effectively choose the judges that hear them. at a hearing last week on a justice department request that one such case be transferred to another federal court, the judge seemed to dismiss doj's concerns and appeared to blame the department for creating any perception that the case assignment set up was unfair. the judge, us district judge drew tipton, is one of three judges presiding over cases where doj has called out texas for funneling its litigation against the biden administration to courthouses -- often in remote parts of the state -- where a single, pre-determined judge is assigned most or all of the cases. with its tactics, texas can ""circumvent the random assignment system by never filing in divisions where they have a non-trivial chance of not knowing what judge they are likely to be assigned,"" the doj said in brief submitted to tipton this week. private litigants have been accused of taking advantage of the system as well -- with perhaps the most high-profile example being a lawsuit by anti-abortion activists seeking to block the fda's approval of a drug used in medication abortions, the most common method of terminating a pregnancy. the case is before judge matthew kacsmaryk, a trump appointee who has issued controversial rulings against the biden administration in the past and who is all but guaranteed to hear cases filed in the amarillo division, where the medication abortion lawsuit was brought. the doj asked kacsmaryk last month to transfer a separate, texas-brought lawsuit against the administration -- a challenge to climate change-related regulations for investors -- to another district. on monday the department filed a similar request with another trump-appointee, judge james wesley hendrix, in a case texas filed that takes aim at the annual federal spending bill that biden signed late last year. texas attorney general ken paxton's office denies it's done anything improper in where it has filed cases. ""there are numerous compelling reasons for these cases to be heard where they are filed,"" paige wiley, a paxton spokesperson, told cnn in an email. she accused the biden administration of ""perpetuating"" a ""baseless smear"" of judge-shopping that ""risks undermining the public's trust in the legal system."" texas and private conservative activists have had a remarkable success rate in securing court orders that block nationwide major biden agenda items -- often in lawsuits filed in divisions where a particular judge is guaranteed to hear the case. when those judges' orders are appealed, they go to the us 5th circuit court of appeals, perhaps the most conservative appeals court in the country. forum shopping is a strategy embraced by litigants on the left and the right. progressives were strategic in where they brought cases against the trump administration. but legal experts say there's a distinction between the practice then and the current trends, because with the trump-era cases, those lawsuits were filed in courthouses where one of several democratic-appointed judges could be assigned the case. tipton, however, seemed largely unconcerned with texas' tactics of targeting its cases at his courtroom, as he grilled a doj attorney on whether the department was suggesting the judge would be unfair. tipton told the doj attorney, erez reuveni, that the department could help with the perception of fairness by saying on the public record that it believed that tipton, as a judge, would give them a fair shake. ""wouldn't that go a long way to addressing any public perception issues?"" tipton said, according to a transcript of the hearing. a record of wins for texas paxton's office has brought 28 cases against the biden administration in texas federal courts, according to a doj brief, which said that all of those lawsuits have been filed ""in just seven divisions where local rules severely limit the number of judges to whom the cases could be assigned."" eighteen of those cases were filed in divisions where a single, pre-determined judge is assigned all lawsuits, the doj has said. tipton presides over virtually all civil litigation filed in victoria, texas, including at least seven lawsuits brought by paxton against the administration in that division. in one of those cases -- concerning the how the administration prioritizes deportations -- tipton in 2021 halted the policy and ordered regular updates from the administration on how it was managing its deportations in accordance with his order. that case is now being reviewed by the us supreme court, which has kept the biden policy on pause. tipton was appointed by former president donald trump and is viewed as a very conservative judge, having been confirmed without the support of any democrats. hendrix, another trump appointee, hears two-thirds of the civil lawsuits filed in the lubbock division, which is located in northwest texas and is several hours' drive from the state's biggest cities. doj, with its monday request in the spending legislation case, asked the judge to move the lawsuit to dc or to austin. the department argued that texas' ""sole allegation related to an event in texas is the national board's award of a grant to a non-profit organization in houston."" kacsmaryk, meanwhile, is assigned every civil case filed in amarillo, another division in northern texas. the judge has ruled in favor of texas in disputes over biden administration's lgbt protections and the president's attempts to end trump-era migration restrictions. he is now in the national spotlight for his forthcoming ruling in the medication abortion case, which could be issued any day now. the lead plaintiff in that case, a medical organization called the alliance for hippocratic medicine, filed its paperwork incorporating in amarillo just a few months before filing the lawsuit. however, the organization's attorney pushed back on allegations that the filing location was chosen strategically to get the case before kacsmaryk. ""it's an utterly nonsensical argument to make because we have every right to file a lawsuit where our clients are injured,"" erik baptist -- a senior counsel at alliance defending freedom, which is representing the abortion pill challengers -- told cnn. he pointed to an individual plaintiff in the lawsuit, dr. shaun jester, who practices near amarillo. ""congress has authorized the american public to sue federal agencies where the american public has actually been injured and where they reside,"" baptist said. ""and that's exactly what dr. jester did here. he filed this lawsuit with the other plaintiffs in this case because he is based in the amarillo area, and therefore, we filed this lawsuit where he resides."" texas defends its tactics to explain why its lawsuits against the biden administration often end up in single-judge divisions miles from the state capital, texas is leaning on case law that says that states -- when suing the federal government -- reside in all parts of their borders and are not restricted to filing suits in the court divisions containing their state capitals. leif olson, an attorney in paxton's office, told tipton at last week's hearing that ""i don't know why our office chooses to file in seven divisions over and over,"" referring to the seven divisions doj highlighted in its briefs. olson told tipton that the specific immigration case was filed in victoria because paxton's office felt like it knew how the judge ran his court room and because tipton was familiar with the statutes relevant to the case. ""the long and short of it, your honor, is that the public interest is served by having the case decided fairly and quickly. that is available in the victoria division,"" olson said. reuveni, the doj attorney, meanwhile, stressed that their motion wasn't targeted at tipton, whom the department thought was a fair judge, but rather it was aimed at texas' tactics. reuveni said that the department would have no issue if the case was randomly assigned to tipton, having been transferred to a court division where tipton shares case assignment with other judges. tipton, however, suggested doj was to blame for exacerbating any public perception of unfairness, and the judge highlighted his tendency of granting doj requests for pauses of his orders so they can be appealed. when pressed by the judge, reuveni confirmed that the department believed that tipton was impartial. ""don't you think if the public heard the department of justice say that, that it would go a long way towards addressing your public perception concern?"" the judge said. the judge is expected to rule on the motion to transfer in the next few weeks.

Michigan threats deepen America's dangerous nexus between antisemitism and political violence,2023-03-03,2.0,"an alleged threat to kill jewish government leaders in michigan reflects two of the most dangerous, and interlocking, menaces in american politics and society -- an alarming spike in antisemitism and escalating threats against elected officials. police last month arrested a man accused of posting a twitter threat to ""carry out the punishment of death"" against anyone jewish in the wolverine state's government. michigan attorney general dana nessel said on thursday she was among those targeted. this is the latest example of a growing trend of intimidation and attacks targeting jewish people at a time when extremists, who might once have been isolated, find affirmation and spurs to act from social media. only a few years ago, top american officials would bemoan rising antisemitism in europe and question whether the lessons of the holocaust were being forgotten: now it's a growing and pernicious feature of us life that threatens the security and peace of mind of millions of citizens whom extremists want to ostracize as outsiders in their own country. in certain political and social media circles -- sometimes fueled by celebrities -- antisemitic rhetoric that was once taboo seems to be filtering into accepted discourse, alongside conspiracy theories like qanon. it is hardly a coincidence that assaults, vandalism and harassment targeting jewish communities and individuals in the united states have raced to their highest levels on record. and the consequences run much deeper than this inhumanity. history shows that antisemitism, which is attractive to unhinged conspiracy theorists, is often an early warning sign or a symptom of deepening threats to democracy. the latest spate of incidents targeting jewish americans coincides with unprecedented attacks on the integrity of elections and the public officials who administer them. it comes as right-wing commentators muse about ""great replacement theory,"" which posits that outsiders are coming to america to overwhelm its majority white population -- a fantasy that has its roots in antisemitism but is now often applied to migrants. ""unfortunately, whether it is in michigan or other parts of the country, we are seeing the confluence of anti-government, covid and other conspiracy theories combined with antisemitism, and we see how this is animating people to action,"" oren segal, vice president of the center on extremism at the anti-defamation league, said on cnn thursday. ""it is not only operating in spaces online but in the fantasies and imaginations of people who are willing to then take action."" violence as a political tool this is an age when political brutality isn't just some remote theoretical possibility. ex-president donald trump's lies and incitement spilled over after the 2020 presidential election, when the us capitol insurrection chillingly revealed that some americans view violence as a legitimate tool to express their political grievances. the unrelenting lies about a stolen election, the currency that election deniers have on the right and the endless propaganda on conservative television curate a festering pool of anger that influences those who are tempted to act on their own anti-democratic grievances. the alleged threats against specifically jewish officials in michigan are only the most recent and high-profile example of a rising tide of antisemitism. last month, san francisco police arrested a man who allegedly made political statements and fired apparently blank rounds in a synagogue. days earlier, a man allegedly threw a molotov cocktail at a synagogue in new jersey. in december, a 63-year-old man was assaulted in new york's central park in what police called an antisemitic attack. these were just the latest is a string of antisemitic incidents that included incendiary tweets from ye, the rapper formerly known as kanye west, with whom trump dined at mar-a-lago in november, alongside white supremacist nick fuentes. also last year, demonstrators were spotted giving the nazi salute and holding banners targeting jews on a los angeles bridge. shocking antisemitic messages were also projected onto buildings in jacksonville, florida. in 2018, a mass shooting at the pittsburgh tree of life synagogue that killed 11 people stunned the nation. the year before, white supremacists converged on charlottesville, virginia, chanting, ""jews will not replace us,"" in a march over which then-president donald trump equivocated. scores more incidents failed to make national headlines but have had a corrosive and frightening impact on america's jewish community. the anti-defamation league, in the latest available annual figures, found that a total of 2,717 antisemitic incidents were reported in 2021 -- a 34% increase on the 2,026 incidents reported the year before. in the new case in michigan, the fbi national threat operations center told the detroit fbi office that a person with the twitter handle ""tempered_reason"" said he was heading to michigan and ""threatening to carry out the punishment of death to anyone that is jewish in the michigan govt."" any attempt to ""subdue"" him would ""be met with deadly force in self-defense,"" the user said. former deputy fbi director andrew mccabe said thursday that the details of the alleged threats to nessel and other officials underscored the increasing risks of political attacks motivated by antisemitism and extremism. ""this is right in the wheelhouse of what the fbi and director [chris] wray have told us. that ... the most dangerous, the most concerning threat that they face on the counterterrorist side, and that is the threat from domestic violent extremists,"" mccabe said on ""cnn newsroom."" he added that such offenders were often ""motivated by racial animus, they're motivated by antisemitic feelings, by anti-immigrant feelings, charged sometimes with political grievance and then motivated to act violently on their own."" the dangers to democracy posed by political intimidation even without the antisemitic dimension, the alleged threats to nessel and other officials are a fresh example of michigan's problem with political hate and extremism, though the state is far from alone in seeing its officials exposed to intimidation. in december, a federal judge sentenced one of the convicted leaders of a separate plot to kidnap democratic gov. gretchen whitmer to nearly 20 years in prison. the man's lawyers argued he had descended down a ""conspiracy rabbit hole"" during long solo trips as a truck driver. another democratic state official involved in election administration, michigan secretary of state jocelyn benson, has said armed protesters turned up outside her home to denounce her as a ""traitor"" in late 2020 when trump was pushing lies about a stolen election in the critical swing state. outside michigan, two georgia election officials testified last year to the house select committee investigating the january 6, 2021, insurrection how verbal attacks on them by trump and his aides had ruined their lives, with one saying, ""there is nowhere i feel safe."" in january, a republican former candidate for new mexico's legislature -- who claimed there had been election fraud, according to police -- was arrested on suspicion of orchestrating shootings that damaged the homes of democratic elected leaders. and paul pelosi, the husband of former house speaker nancy pelosi, is still recovering from a late october assault, allegedly by a man with a hammer who told police that democrats had committed crimes against trump, using rhetoric popular with the ex-president's supporters. democrats are not the only victims of extremism. in 2017, republican rep. steve scalise of louisiana, who now serves as house majority leader, was seriously injured in a shooting at a congressional baseball practice by a man claiming to be a bernie sanders supporter. and last year, police arrested a man near brett kavanaugh's home and charged him with attempting to murder the conservative supreme court justice. and as recently as thursday, new hampshire woman katelyn jones, 25, pleaded guilty to sending a series of threatening texts to a michigan county election official after the 2020 election. she faces up to 10 years in prison when she is sentenced in july, according to the justice department. each case is different, and individuals act on their own agency however they might be persuaded by heated political rhetoric. politicians often use this to claim plausible deniability that their words caused violence. but the house january 6 committee aired video of trump supporters on the day of the riot saying they were inspired by his false claims of election fraud. and a poll from the washington post and the university of maryland in january 2022 found that 34% of americans -- and 41% of republicans -- think violent action against the government is sometimes justified. it is also undeniable that antisemitic attacks and violence and threats against public officials are coming at a time when the ex-president and his supporters have made false claims about stolen elections, which have been amplified by powerful media organizations like fox news, even when -- as emerged in court filings this week -- the network's leaders knew those claims to be lies. just this week, georgia rep. marjorie taylor greene, who also has a record of spreading antisemitic material, showed up at a meeting on election integrity and berated gabriel sterling, a republican election official from the peach state who resisted trump's baseless claims that he won the swing state in 2020. greene fired off a flurry of claims and conspiracies for the cameras, which were almost all false. ""she came in late. she purposely sat next to me because she wanted to get her social media hits,"" sterling told cnn's anderson cooper on wednesday. behavior like that often seen from greene and trump risks damaging democracy at its roots, since it comes with sometimes dangerous consequences for local public officials like michigan's nessel, who are critical to ensuring americans can vote. ""it's happening in almost every state. it's happening against regular people,"" said rachel kleinfeld, a senior fellow in the democracy, conflict and governance program at the carnegie endowment for international peace. ""who is willing to take these jobs?"" she asked, before warning: ""our democracy is only as good as the people we elect, and we can only elect the people willing to run. and polling is showing that people are stepping back from running when they have to add this to a stressful job that doesn't pay particularly well and puts them in the literal targets of their fellow citizens.""",9.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.8735021319654253,0.11055168312870794,0.01594618024925391,-0.9006469406544032,0,0,0,0,-8.105822465889629,,,
Fair and Balanced? Murdoch's private messages show Fox News was instructed to help Republicans,2023-03-03,3.0,"""we report. you decide."" that was the longtime slogan of fox news. but a deposition and private messages made public in recent weeks has exposed that even rupert murdoch doesn't treat fox news like an actual news organization. the revelation is part of several legal filings from dominion voting systems' $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against the right-wing talk channel, uncovering numerous instances in which the fox corporation chairman brazenly directed the network's leadership to help the republican party. a version of this article first appeared in the ""reliable sources"" newsletter. sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. taken as a whole, the statements show that murdoch apparently views fox news more like an extension of the gop than a credible news organization with a mission of informing viewers and allowing them to arrive at their own decisions. the legal filings are littered with examples of murdoch tipping the scales: ► murdoch gave jared kushner ""confidential information"" about then-candidate joe biden's ads ""along with debate strategy"" in 2020, a filing said, offering donald trump's son-in-law ""a preview of biden's ads before they were public."" ► murdoch asked fox news chief executive suzanne scott to have sean hannity say ""something supportive"" about republican sen. lindsey graham ahead of the 2020 election. murdoch explained, ""we cannot lose the senate if at all possible."" ► following trump's loss, murdoch told scott to ""concentrate on georgia"" when the state was holding a high-stakes special election that would decide the balance of power in the us senate, instructing her to be ""helping any way we can."" ► when trump appealed for help defeating republican west virginia senate candidate don blankenship, murdoch told scott and fox news president jay wallace, ""anything during day helpful but sean [hannity] and laura [ingraham] dumping on him hard might save the day."" ► when then-new york post editor col allan told murdoch that biden's only hope for winning the election was ""to stay in his basement and not face serious questions,"" murdoch responded, ""just made sure fox banging on about these issues. if the audience talks the theme will spread."" taken in isolation, any one of these actions would be considered a major scandal at an actual news organization. there would be investigations and likely disciplinary measures would ensue. but at fox news, that's not the case. that's almost certainly because the leadership does not view the channel in the same way that it is marketed to viewers and advertisers. and murdoch isn't the only person in leadership who seemingly doesn't view fox news as a straight-shooting news organization (which, to be clear, it most definitely is not). in the dominion filings, former house speaker turned fox corporation board member paul ryan wrote the murdochs, ""[t]he sooner we can put down the echoes of falsehoods from our side, the faster we can get onto principled loyal opposition."" notice the words ryan used there: ""loyal opposition."" that's what ryan thinks fox news should apparently be, in its best form. critics have long accused fox news of being the ""opposition"" to democratic officeholders and candidates. honest observers have known for quite some time that that is the case. it's just striking to hear fox leadership like ryan talk openly behind the scenes about what the company is at its core. fox news has accused dominion of having ""cherry picked"" statements to unfairly malign the network. but it's hard to see how, under any circumstances, these instructions to a supposed network news chief would be appropriate.

Jim Jordan's first FBI whistleblowers face scrutiny from skeptical Democrats,2023-03-03,4.0,"in his quest to prove the federal government has been ""weaponized"" against conservatives, republican house judiciary chairman jim jordan has touted the allegations of what he claims are ""dozens"" of whistleblowers who have come to his office with stories of discrimination and bias. while little is known about them, jordan's reliance on these whistleblowers is already emerging as an early flashpoint, with democrats raising questions about their legitimacy as actual whistleblowers and the relevance of their testimony. three of jordan's witnesses have come in for private interviews with committee staff so far. none of them appear to have had their claims validated by government entities that grant federal whistleblower protection, sources familiar with their testimony said. one who alleged there was fbi wrongdoing had their claims rejected. another is retired and it's unclear whether he has first-hand knowledge of the violations he alleges. the third has not revealed his direct disclosures or fbi suspension notice to house democrats, according to transcripts reviewed by cnn. separately, several other supposed whistleblowers who have not come in for interviews were suspended from the fbi for being at the capitol on january 6, 2021, according to multiple sources familiar with the committee's work. this is a point jordan has not shied away from, using the accounts of ""several whistleblowers"" in a may 2022 letter to accuse the fbi of ""retaliating against employees"" for engaging in ""protected first amendment activity on january 6."" jordan added in the letter that he had been told none of these whistleblowers were inside the us capitol, charged with any crime or contacted by law enforcement about their actions. for more than a year, jordan has made whistleblower allegations a central part of his campaign to uncover what he claims is political bias inside the federal government, including drafting a 1,000-page report last year that leans heavily on claims by government employees alleging political interference by both the justice department and the fbi. that report and the groundswell of support among house republicans helped lead to the creation of an entire subcommittee jordan now leads, the ""select subcommittee on the weaponization of the federal government,"" which is helming the whistleblower interviews. democrats on jordan's weaponization subcommittee, already skeptical of its premise, are frustrated that many of the materials regarding these individuals have not been shared. while democratic members and their staff have interviewed some of these people behind closed doors alongside their gop counterparts, what they have learned so far has not been encouraging, democrats told cnn. ""who knows whether he has dozens. who are these people? why haven't we been given a list? what kind of credibility do they have?"" democratic rep. gerry connolly, who serves on the subcommittee, told cnn. gop rep. kelly armstrong, who serves on jordan's weaponization subcommittee, accused democrats of discrediting the whistleblowers before having a chance to hear them out. ""discounting whistleblowers before the democrats know what the witnesses have to offer says a lot more about their agenda than it does about the validity of the whistleblowers,"" armstrong told cnn. ""procedural mistakes should splatter like paint. it's messy but the results should be random. in my four years here every mistake doj has made has benefited one side and harmed the other. that's a hell of a coincidence,"" armstrong told cnn. a senior gop staffer told cnn that jordan plans to share whistleblower information only if the individual agrees to go on the record. ""if they're willing to go on the record, if they're willing to sit for transcribed interviews, that's the point where we provide their name and attorney to our democrats. and that's pretty standard,"" the senior gop staffer said. russell dye, a spokesperson for jordan, said in a statement to cnn, ""it is beyond disappointing, but sadly not surprising, that democrats would leak cherry-picked excerpts of testimony to attack the brave whistleblowers who risked their careers to speak out on abuses at the justice department and fbi."" 'an elephant gun to kill a mouse': a suspended fbi agent's concerns with a swat arrest some of jordan's whistleblowers who have been suspended from the fbi have formed a ""little bit of a network,"" the senior republican aide told cnn. one whistleblower told cnn that some of them communicate over a group text chain and that many initially connected through a community of unvaccinated employees. right-wing opinions about the january 6 attack appear to be a consistent throughline among the three individuals that have come forward so far. one of them is steve friend, a former fbi agent working out of florida who was suspended in august 2022 for objecting to using a swat team to arrest a subject for what friend described as ""misdemeanor offenses."" friend, who was interviewed by republican and democratic subcommittee staff earlier this month, was not part of the swat team but was asked to help with the case and refused, he told cnn in an interview. the men arrested on the date friend listed in his disclosures were members of a florida-based organization known as the ""guardians of freedom,"" which adheres to the ideology of the ""three percenters"" and were illegally at the capitol on january 6, according to the fbi. the one individual charged with a misdemeanor of that group from florida was at the capitol on january 6 wearing a black gas mask, a tactical vest and a military-type helmet and goggles, according to court documents reviewed by cnn. one witness interviewed for the case claimed that the defendant had an ar-style rifle with him as well. following his subcommittee interview, friend told cnn he was suspended, in part, for raising concerns that the fbi was using ""unnecessary force."" ""i compared it to using an elephant gun to kill a mouse,"" friend, who officially resigned from the fbi on the day of his interview with committee staff, told cnn. friend also told cnn that his concern with using a swat team would contribute to the illusion that ""half the country are potentially domestic terrorists"" and therefore prevent people from participating ""in a political dialogue."" friend admitted in the subcommittee interview that owning a gun or being accused of a felony crime were reasons for fbi management to consider using a swat team, according to transcripts reviewed by cnn. after friend was suspended for refusing to help in the case, he filed a whistleblower complaint to the justice department inspector general on september 21, 2022. he also filed a claim with the us office of special counsel, the function of which is to protect federal employees making whistleblower complaints. friend's claim was eventually rejected by both entities. ""we cannot find with a substantial likelihood that the agency has violated a law, rule, or regulation or has abused its authority. therefore, we will take no further action on this matter,"" the november 10, 2022, osc report read, according to a copy reviewed by cnn. on december 2, 2022, the doj inspector general declined to open an investigation into the claims friend raised. friend is still waiting for the oig to render a decision about his claims that the fbi retaliated against him. us law creates specific requirements for those who say they have been retaliated against for their claims. an individual must make a disclosure to the special counsel, to an inspector general or to congress that provides evidence of any violation of ""any rule, law or regulation"" or ""gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety."" friend is now a senior fellow at the center for renewing america, a policy shop run by former trump administration officials. ""steve friend bravely blew the whistle on fbi overreach and is devoted to ending the abuses of federal law enforcement,"" rachel semmel, a spokesperson for the group, told cnn. ""we are proud to have him working with us at center for renewing america."" fbi spokesperson christina pullen told cnn, ""employees who don't carry out their responsibilities are held accountable through an objective administrative process. the fbi is required to follow established policies and procedures, to include a thorough investigation, when suspending or revoking a security clearance. fbi employees who report evidence of wrongdoing through a protected disclosure are protected from retaliation."" 'insurrection my a$$': a retired fbi agent's allegations judiciary committee staff have also interviewed a former fbi analyst who retired in october 2021 named george hill, who supervised intelligence analysts that provided support to less than a dozen cases related to january 6. in his interview with the subcommittee hill criticized a bank that he says shared with the fbi records of people who were in dc on january 6, according to transcripts reviewed by cnn. when pressed, hill said he simply saw a record listed in sentinel, the fbi's case management system, and that he did not open it, according to the transcript. as part of its investigation into the january 6 attack at the capitol, the fbi collected financial, communications and other business records of people investigated for possible crimes related to the capitol riot. it's a routine investigative tool used to help investigators and prosecutors gather evidence. bank transactions could be used to show travel and location of suspected rioters, and could be used to establish the purchase of weapons used in the attacks on police protecting the capitol. hill also raised concerns about a request that he says the washington, dc, fbi field office made to the boston field office to open preliminary investigations into two buses of people that traveled into dc on january 6. in his interview with the committee, hill said he was told about the request, sources familiar with his testimony told cnn. hill said there were concerns about violating people's first amendment protected activity, the transcript read. pullen said in a statement to cnn, ""the fbi's policy is to neither confirm nor deny the existence of investigations, however, the fbi will never open an investigation based solely on first amendment protected activity,"" when asked about the claim of an investigation being opened into those buses. hill has previously raised some of his claims on a podcast and in an interview with ""just the news."" hill's interview covered tweets he made concerning the january 6 attack, a number of which have since been deleted, according to the transcript reviewed by cnn. on december 28, 2022, for example, hill tweeted, ""insurrection my a$$. it was a set up and sadly, there's no shortage of idiots willing to take",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.029833953827619553,0.8837989568710327,0.08636709302663803,0.12723872464998026,0,0,0,0,0.12723872464998026,-12.818638617252907,22.0,-0.5826653916933139
Opinion: How a third party could unintentionally lead to a Trump 2024 victory,2023-03-02,5.0,"as he was planning his 2000 third-party bid for the presidency, ralph nader asked me to meet with him. nader strongly believed that he could launch a viable green party, seizing at least 5% of the national vote, which would qualify the greens for federal matching funds, and begin to erode what he called ""the two-party duopoly."" ""i'm not sure if you can do that,"" i told nader. ""but i am sure of this: if you succeed, you'll elect george w. bush."" nader vehemently disagreed. he thought that then-vice president al gore would still have enough votes to win comfortably, and he wanted to pull him to the left. i failed to dissuade nader, obviously. the rest, as they say, is history. bush was credited with a win in florida by just 537 votes. nader received 97,488 votes in florida. some might say that third-party presidential candidates are like cockroaches in the kitchen. to quote legendary texas longhorn football coach darrell royal, ""it's not what they eat and tote off, it's what they fall into and mess up that hurts."" the good folks of the political organization no labels are diving into the presidential election of 2024. the organization describes itself as a group that ""demands american leaders and citizens alike declare their freedom from the anger and divisiveness that are ruining our politics and, most importantly, our country."" and yet their central project -- organizing a moderate third-party candidacy for president in 2024 -- would, despite their stated intentions, likely reward the most extreme, most divisive, most angry forces in our politics. in a video on their website, chief strategist ryan clancy explains his group is working to get a spot on the ballot in all 50 states, ""to create an opening for a presidential ticket that stands for the kind of ideas that appeal to most people, even if it drives the extremes crazy."" what ideas? well, clancy says in the video, they're coming. ""soon."" no labels, thus far, has offered no concrete ideas or policies. nothing about whether corporations should pay more in taxes, as democrats want, or less, as republicans do. nothing about whether health care should be more driven by private markets, as republicans favor, or more heavily subsidized by the government, as democrats do. all we know is that no labels rejects partisanship and division and extremism. here's the simple political reality, as i see it: in recent elections, most voters who reject extremism have tended to vote democratic. this means the vast majority of votes that a no labels presidential candidate would receive would likely come out of president joe biden's pool of potential voters, not former president donald trump's -- assuming the 2024 election turns out to be a 2020 rematch. third way, another centrist public policy group, has a more compelling answer. according to their analysis, a third-party candidate ""would act as a spoiler,"" and that the kind of post-partisan candidacy no labels calls for would pull disproportionately from the democratic nominee. simply put, there is no way in the world a third-party candidate can win. but a moderate third-party candidate would, in my estimation, almost certainly elect mr. trump. ross perot, the most successful independent candidate in modern times, who spent millions of his money on campaigning, won nearly one out of every five votes in 1992 -- and earned precisely zero electoral votes. what made perot different from the no labels effort is he drew from both parties. his pro-change, pro-choice, anti-gulf war, anti-nafta positions drew from democratic candidate bill clinton's voter base, and his pro-business, anti-deficit positions drew from republican president george h.w. bush's base. the strongest third-party candidate ever was former republican president theodore roosevelt, who got 88 electoral votes -- not near enough to win, but more than enough to swing the 1912 election away from his former gop protégé william howard taft and give the presidency to democrat woodrow wilson. the best performance by an independent since roosevelt was democrat-turned-independent george wallace, who in 1968 won five states. in the half-century since, not a single independent presidential candidate has won a single electoral vote. democrats may not want to hear this, but third way does not flinch from the facts: trump got more votes in 2020 than in 2016. after two impeachments, after banning people from muslim-majority countries, after siding with putin over us intelligence agencies in helsinki, after initially saying covid-19 would ""disappear."" after all that, he got more raw votes and a higher percentage of the vote in the key swing states of michigan, wisconsin and pennsylvania. but whereas democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton lost those states in 2016, biden won them. why? as third way states, ""in 2016, there was a third slice eating into clinton's support. in 2020, that third party segment shrank, so biden's support eclipsed trump's."" in 2016, two third parties -- the libertarian and the green parties -- both competed heavily across the country, drawing almost 6 million votes between the two of them. in 2020, voters pulled back from third parties, and they drew closer to 2 million votes. though that was not the only reason for biden's success, as third way points out, ""biden won 2016 third-party voters by a 30-point margin."" of course, there was not a wholesale rejection of trump's brand of extremism in 2020, nor is there likely to be in 2024. but a sensible, centrist, moderate, anti-partisan candidate, as no labels is seeking, will succeed in electing trump, the most divisive, polarizing politician of modern times.",5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.4435765936970711,0.3623724985867739,0.19405087381601333,-0.4548423515033287,0,0,0,0,-2.2742117575166434,-14.332428521962692,25.0,-0.5732971408785077
Justice Department pushes back on Trump's sweeping claims of presidential immunity for January 6 speech,2023-03-02,6.0,"the justice department on thursday urged an appeals court to reject sweeping claims of presidential immunity put forward by former president donald trump in the civil litigation surrounding the january 6, 2021, insurrection at the us capitol. the department told the appeals court -- which is considering several private lawsuits brought against trump for his conduct in the lead-up to the attack on the capitol -- that a president can't be absolutely immune for speech on a matter of public concern if the speech is found to have incited violence. ""no part of a president's official responsibilities includes the incitement of imminent private violence,"" the justice department said in a friend-of-a-court brief that the us dc circuit court of appeals asked the government to file. thursday's brief marks the first time the department has confronted directly the question of trump's civil immunity for his conduct related to january 6. the lawsuits were brought by democratic members of the house and capitol police officers. a 1982 ruling from the us supreme court established that presidents are absolutely immune from civil damages arising from their official acts as president -- but when presidential speech amounts to an official act is still a murky question for the courts. the new filing stressed how difficult the legal disputes around the presidential immunity are, with the justice department telling the dc circuit that in ""all contexts, questions of presidential immunity must be approached with the greatest sensitivity to the unremitting demands of the presidency."" the justice department did caution the court against using the january 6 civil cases as a vehicle to draw firm lines on whether president can face liability for speech related to electoral or political concerns. instead, the department asked the dc circuit to issue a ""narrow"" ruling, focused solely on the assertion by trump's attorneys that he should be immune to civil lawsuits for presidential speech even if that speech incited violence. the january 6 civil cases are currently at a phase where courts are weighing questions about the legal strength of the claims against trump, and those courts are not yet considering the factual merits of the allegations against the former president. a district court judge previously denied a trump motion to dismiss the case, finding that the former president was not absolutely immune from the civil january 6 lawsuit. the dc circuit is now considering a trump request to reverse that ruling. after hearing arguments on the matter last year, the appeals court invited the justice department to weigh in. ""the united states here expresses no view on the district court's conclusion that plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that president trump's january 6 speech incited the subsequent attack on the capitol,"" the doj said in its brief. ""but because actual incitement would be unprotected by absolute immunity even if it came in the context of a speech on matters of public concern, this court should reject the categorical argument president trump pressed below and renews on appeal."" in response to the filing, a trump spokesperson said, ""the d.c. courts should rule in favor of president trump in short order and dismiss these frivolous lawsuits."" whether trump can face certain civil lawsuits for his conduct while in the white house has been tricky ground for the justice department to navigate. the justice department, under attorney general merrick garland, came under fire from the left when it held onto the department's trump-era position that trump could not be sued personally for allegedly defaming a woman who accused him of sexual assault. the courts are still considering the question, but if it sides with doj, that would force the dismissal of the case, brought by e. jean carroll. in the january 6 civil cases, the department is seeking to take a very precise stance for why trump could potentially be held liable in the civil lawsuits for his january 6-related conduct. it is asking the dc circuit to not issue any ruling that would attempt ""to comprehensively define the boundaries of the president's immunity for his speech on matters of public concern -- including when and how to draw a line between the president's official and electoral speech."" the justice department emphasized it was not weighing in on any potential criminal liability. in the brief, the department said in a footnote that it ""does not express any view regarding the potential criminal liability of any person for the events of january 6, 2021, or acts connected with those events."" a special counsel is leading a federal criminal investigation into efforts by trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election. this story has been updated with additional reporting.",14.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.8045743762382439,0.16163096457187617,0.03379467149664249,-0.8212577424058249,0,0,0,0,-11.49760839368155,-23.24635779195388,32.0,-0.7264486809985587

'late show with david letterman' appearance (2010) rock appeared on the talk show many times, but a 2010 appearance stands out. at the time, letterman was recovering from a public scandal after admitting he had been in intimate relationships with some female staffers. the host was under the weather and losing his voice, so rock asked him why he hadn't taken a few days off. ""wife still mad at ya, ain't she?"" rock joked. ""why drive back to connecticut to a mean woman?

"DeSantis says GOP will not 'mess with Social Security,' as Democrats and Trump slam his past support for privatization",2023-03-02,8.0,"florida gov. ron desantis on thursday distanced himself from his past support for privatizing social security and raising the retirement age as potential future political foes seize on his previous ideas for the popular retirement program. ""we're not going to mess with social security as republicans,"" desantis told fox news. ""i think that that's pretty clear."" as a congressman, desantis voted for nonbinding budget resolutions that would have made age 70 the new threshold for seniors to collect their federal benefits. a recent cnn kfile review review of desantis' comments during his 2012 congressional campaign found support for privatizing social security as well. the attempt by desantis to publicly walk back a position foundational to the fiscal conservatism that defined his early political career comes as former president donald trump has made support for medicare and social security an early fault line in the 2024 gop presidential primary. trump has singled out desantis, who is traveling the country to promote his new book and raise his profile ahead of a highly anticipated campaign for president. unloading on his social media platform, trump this week called desantis ""the man who wants to cut social security and medicare"" and a ""wheelchair over the cliff kind of guy, just like his hero, failed politician paul ryan."" the criticism revived an attack line democrats used over a decade ago to undercut ryan, the wisconsin republican who proposed partial privatization of medicare and social security in his budget blueprints and was named mitt romney's running mate in 2012. in an ad that aired in multiple swing states, an actor seemingly portraying ryan wheeled an elderly woman to the edge of a cliff and pushed her over. desantis has largely avoided engaging with trump and didn't previously respond to questions about his past positions. his new book, ""the courage to be free,"" glosses over his early political career and his nearly three terms in congress, instead focusing largely on the cultural fights that have defined his first term as governor and fueled his ascent in the gop. but thursday, in his latest of several appearances promoting his book, desantis was asked by fox news host dana perino about a proposal to raise the retirement age for federal benefits to 70. he pivoted to criticizing president joe biden's past votes on social security before appearing to dismiss concerns about the long-term financial outlook of federal entitlement programs. ""there's a lot of the budget people used to say, they would blame social security or medicare for budget woes. but the reality is they have printed trillions and trillions of dollars, and that has really fueled the inflation,"" the governor said. the statement appears at odds with what desantis said in 2012, when he first ran for congress as a tea party conservative and a disciple of ryan's and his hawkish budgets. desantis said at the time that it was ""unsustainable"" to allow seniors to retire before their late 60s, cnn kfile found. he also voiced support for ryan's plans for privatizing social security. ""what i think we need to do for people in my generation, particularly, is start to restructure the program in a way that's going to be financially sustainable, both social security and medicare,"" he said at the time. desantis' about-face drew immediate rebuke thursday from the democratic national committee, which accused the republican governor in a press release of attempting to ""completely rewrite his long, established record of supporting cuts to social security and medicare."" on social media, the party posted side-by-side video featuring desantis' past comments and his remarks thursday. as trump pressures republicans to support medicare and social security, other potential 2024 contenders have voiced support for making changes to the programs. former vice president mike pence told cnbc last month that social security and medicare needs to be ""on the table"" in dealing with us national debt. former south carolina gov. nikki haley declared early in her campaign for president that ""we do have to address entitlements"" for future beneficiaries. desantis' pivot marks the second time he has appeared to change his position to more closely align with trump's. the governor recently voiced opposition to american intervention in the conflict between russia and ukraine, after repeatedly voicing support in the past for sending ""defensive and offensive"" weapons to ukraine to deter russian aggression. while trump has tried to pull his potential primary opponents into uncomfortable policy fights in recent weeks, desantis has sought to steer the narrative around his likely candidacy to his legislative wins as governor. he launched his new book a day after signing a bill that effectively gives him control of disney's special taxing district in florida, a saga that is recounted in detail in his political memoir. in his appearance on fox news, desantis teased a potential announcement after the upcoming legislative session, which starts next week, when the governor is expected to push through more of his ideological agenda. ""when we get on the other side of that, assuming we've been successful,"" desantis said, ""we'll take a look at what that would mean for national."" this story has been updated with additional information.

White House releases ambitious cyber strategy calling for more regulation of vulnerable sectors,2023-03-02,9.0,"the white house on thursday released an ambitious national cybersecurity strategy that calls for new federal regulation of vulnerable critical infrastructure firms and for software makers to be held liable when their products leave gaping holes for hackers to exploit. the strategy -- shaped by major hacking incidents that threatened key public services in the first year of the biden administration -- embraces the us government's regulatory and purchasing power to force companies that are critical to economic and national security to raise their cyber defenses. it reflects a widely held belief in the us government that market forces have failed to keep the nation safe from cybercriminals and an array of foreign governments such as russia and china. ""we have to drive the entire ecosystem to be more cyber vigilant,"" homeland security secretary alejandro mayorkas said in an interview with cnn on thursday. the biden administration will look for new regulatory authorities if necessary ""to make sure that we are shoring up our critical infrastructure"" in the face of advanced hacking threats ""because the adversaries are not decreasing in activity, only increasing."" acting national cyber director kemba walden said that too often small businesses and local governments bear the brunt of cyberattacks. ""this isn't just unfair, it's ineffective,"" said walden, a white house official, told reporters on wednesday. the strategy is a policy document and not law, but it could shape corporate behavior for years to come as firms compete for billions of dollars in federal contracts that increasingly require a minimum set of cybersecurity defenses. and the white house says it wants to work with congress to develop legislation that holds software makers liable when their products and services don't provide adequate protections from sabotage. the goal of us government and corporate work on cybersecurity should be to ""correct market failures, minimize the harms from cyber incidents to society's most vulnerable,"" a copy of the strategy states. the strategy does not specify which sectors of the economy the administration could regulate next, but us officials have previously signaled that one area of focus could be health care. ransomware attacks -- hacks that lock up computer systems and demand a fee -- have put an even greater stress on hospitals across the country struggling with the coronavirus pandemic. so far, the biden administration has imposed cybersecurity requirements on sectors such as aviation and oil and gas pipelines. the genesis for those regulations in many ways was a may 2021 ransomware attack by an alleged russian-speaking hacker that shut down 5,500 miles of fuel pipelines in the us for days. corporations have sometimes balked at the regulations. after oil and gas industry groups complained that cybersecurity regulations from the transportation security administration were too onerous and unrealistic, the biden administration last year revised the regulations to give pipeline operators more time to report cyber incidents to the government. multiple administrations, including the trump and obama administrations, have tried to shore up federal defenses against hacking threats and in some cases drive big changes that make agencies safer in the long term. there has been some progress. agencies now have more visibility into malicious cyber activity than ever before, officials say. but in other cases, bureaucratic inertia has gotten in the way. the government accountability office, a federal watchdog, says it has made over 700 public recommendations for federal agencies to improve their cyber defenses since 2010. about a fifth of the recommendations had not been implemented as of december, according to gao. in the last month, the us marshals service was hit by a ransomware attack that affected sensitive law enforcement information, and the fbi has had to deal with a cyber incident involving a computer network used in investigations of child sexual exploitation. in the interview thursday, mayorkas said it was incumbent on the federal government to share what it learns from hacking incidents so the private sector can protect itself. ""the lessons learned should spread throughout the entire cyber ecosystem and not be limited to the particular domain in which it occurs,"" mayorkas told cnn. geopolitics has also been a roadblock to improved cybersecurity. the us has for years tried to blunt the impacts of hacking operations from russia, china, iran and north korea, to limited effect. and us officials have accused all of those governments of harboring, or even enlisting, cybercriminals that attack us organizations -- accusations those governments deny. after the big pipeline hack in 2021, president joe biden made a big push to get russian president vladimir putin to crack down on cybercriminals operating from russia. but any chances of bilateral cooperation on cybercrime have dimmed after russia's full-scale invasion of ukraine a year ago. a senior administration official acknowledged the obstacle when rolling out the new cybersecurity strategy. ""we do have a problem where russia is serving as a de facto safe haven for cybercrime,"" the official told reporters. in the last few years, including during the trump administration, us officials have rallied support from allies in europe and elsewhere to condemn alleged hacking operations from russia and china, and to arrest cybercriminals who travel to europe.

Opinion: What went right and wrong on Covid,2023-03-01,10.0,"the chinese lab leak report from the department of energy saying it has ""low confidence"" that the covid-19 virus accidentally escaped from a lab in wuhan made headlines earlier this week. then on tuesday, fbi director christopher wray weighed in, telling fox news that ""the fbi has for quite some time now assessed that the origins of the pandemic are most likely a potential lab incident in wuhan."" on wednesday, chinese foreign ministry spokesperson mao ning responded to that assessment, saying that the lab leak theory holds ""no credibility at all."" this all adds to the confusion surrounding the virus's origins. there is considerable science pointing to animal-to-human transmission as the origin of the virus, but there is also credible reporting and the fbi director's public assessment that it likely leaked from labs researching viruses in wuhan. and we may never truly know how the covid-19 virus originated because the chinese government didn't allow international inspectors into wuhan for weeks after a new mysterious, lethal virus first emerged there in december 2019. initially, the local wuhan government downplayed the virus. that doesn't necessarily mean they were covering up a lab leak, but rather this may point to simple incompetence -- a pretty good explanation of most human activity. as cnn noted, ""top-down bureaucracy and rigid procedures that were ill-equipped to deal with the emerging crisis"" may have been to blame, a conclusion based on an examination of internal chinese documents from the first months of the crisis. by the time the central chinese government got serious about the virus, it was already spreading worldwide. while the new department of energy intelligence report does not settle the question of the precise origin of the virus, it does point us to the need for a bipartisan covid-19 commission that goes well beyond us house investigations of covid that are planned for this year. consider that almost as many americans have died of covid-19 already -- some 1.1 million -- as have died in every war since the american revolution. if that isn't a significant national security problem, i'm not sure what is. and yet the united states hasn't had any systematic examination by the government of how this happened. a good deal of that is likely because the whole issue of the pandemic is so politicized -- but so too were the debates about whether the george w. bush administration might have done a better job thwarting the 9/11 attacks. the bush administration initially blocked a commission to investigate 9/11. following intense public pressure, the administration finally agreed to allow a commission to be formed more than a year after the attacks. the 9/11 commission not only told the whole backstory of the attacks, but it also proposed lasting reforms that made americans safer when they were implemented, such as the creation of a national counterterrorism center that coordinates all counterterrorism intelligence across the us government and the creation of a new office of the director of national intelligence which coordinates the work of all of the us intelligence agencies. a similar covid-19 commission must be formed to investigate how the virus emerged, which responses to the virus worked or didn't work as it spread across the united states and the lessons learned for how best to prepare for the next pandemic. each party should appoint subject matter experts on pandemics, epidemiology and emergency response to take part in this covid-19 commission. it should have sufficient staff and money and subpoena power to investigate questions such as, ""how did we get here?"" and, ""what can be done to mitigate the next pandemic?"" of course, some questions may never be completely settled, like the lab leak theory vs. the natural transmission theory. still, there are pressing questions that the covid-19 commission should address so that we are better prepared for the next pandemic, which will inevitably eventually happen. here are eleven questions that a covid-19 commission could try and answer: where did the coronavirus originate from?after 9/11, the us spent many billions of dollars preparing for a possible bioterrorism attack. where did all that funding go and why were those defenses against bioterrorism not more helpful in responding to the pandemic?why did the trump administration eliminate the national security council's pandemic unit in 2018? what effect did that have? an early decision by former president donald trump during the pandemic was to bar non-us citizens who had recently visited china from entering the us. what kind of effect did that have on mitigating the spread of the virus? why didn't the us government ensure there were enough medical-grade masks to cope with the pandemic when it started?why was there so little federal leadership on containing the virus in the early months of the pandemic? those decisions were primarily left to individual states. what effect did this uncoordinated response have?trump said on february 26, 2020, that the number of covid-19 cases would soon be close to zero. he also claimed that the coronavirus was no more dangerous than the flu. what effect did this have on the behavior of the american public and how did that behavior impact the spread of the virus?what role did right-wing media play in downplaying the pandemic and how did that affect sentiments among some republicans that the coronavirus was being hyped?dr. deborah birx, trump's coronavirus response coordinator, told a congressional committee in closed-door testimony in 2021 that ""we probably could have decreased fatalities into the 30-percent-less to 40-percent-less range."" how did she come to that conclusion?to its credit, the trump administration launched ""operation warp speed,"" which saved many lives during the covid-19 pandemic. as part of that effort, the us invested $2.5 billion in moderna, which produced a testable vaccine on humans in only two months. why did operation warp speed work so well? and what are the lessons for future vaccine development? covid-19 mortality rates per capita in the us are much higher than in other wealthy nations such as canada, france, germany and japan. what went right in other countries that didn't go right in the us? if we get some reasonable answers to these and other questions, the next pandemic that rolls around may not claim more than a million american lives.",5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.2214807365089655,0.5126789852976799,0.26584027986973524,0.13516552157206546,0,0,0,0,0.6758276078603274,-7.574456767677885,29.0,-0.2611881644026857
Fact check: Zelensky didn't say American sons and daughters have to fight in Ukraine,2023-03-02,11.0,"a viral video of ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky takes his remarks out of context to wrongly make it sound like he demanded that americans send their sons and daughters to fight in the war in ukraine. the out-of-context 19-second video has been viewed millions of times on twitter. it features a clip of zelensky speaking at a news conference last week as an interpreter translates his words into english as follows: ""the us will have to send their sons and daughters, exactly the same way as we are sending, their sons and daughters to war. and they will have to fight, because it's nato that we're talking about. and they will be dying, god forbid, because it's a horrible thing."" the clip has circulated widely on twitter among critics of american financial and military support for the ukrainian defense against russia's invasion. monica crowley, a conservative commentator who served in the trump administration as a spokesperson for the treasury department, posted the video on tuesday night and wrote, ""zelensky now directly threatening us and claiming american sons and daughters will have to fight and die for ukraine. hell no."" republican sen. mike lee of utah shared former trump administration official william wolfe's tweet of the video in which wolfe claimed that zelensky wants ""dead americans on ukrainian soil."" lee himself added in a tweet on tuesday night: ""zelensky has no right to presume that our sons and daughters will fight his war. shame on him. we've somehow sent the message that we work for him. shame on us!"" facts first: zelensky did not say that american sons and daughters will have to fight in ukraine or die for ukraine. rather, he predicted that if ukraine loses the war against russia because it does not receive sufficient assistance, russia will proceed to enter north atlantic treaty organization member countries in the baltics (a region made up of latvia, lithuania and estonia) that the us will have to send troops to defend. under the treaty that governs nato, an attack on one member is considered an attack on all. ukraine is not a nato member. lee deleted his tweet after cnn informed his office on wednesday about how the video was taken out of context. zelensky made the comments at a news conference on the anniversary of russia's 2022 invasion of ukraine. he was asked what message he would give to the growing number of americans who believe the us is giving ukraine too much support. zelensky began by saying, per the interpreter, ""i would like to thank all of the american people that are supporting ukraine -- the congress, the president, the tv channels, the journalists, and everyone that has been supporting us."" he urged the us to avoid losing its position of ""leadership"" in the world, asked americans to see the ukrainian people as similar to themselves, and said that while ukraine enjoys ""bipartisan support"" in the us, he hears sentiments from time to time that are ""dangerous."" soon after, he said, ""the us is never going to give up on the nato member states. if it happens so that ukraine, due to various opinions and weakening -- depleting -- of assistance, loses, russia is going to enter baltic states, nato member states, and then the us will have to send their sons and daughters, exactly the same way as we are sending, their sons and daughters to war. and they will have to fight, because it's nato that we're talking about. and they will be dying, god forbid, because it's a horrible thing. i wish peace and ukrainian support to the united states."" zelensky's critics are perfectly entitled to criticize his actual remarks about the necessity of continued us support for ukraine. but it's just inaccurate to depict zelensky's ""have to send their sons and daughters"" remark as a demand that americans take part in combat on ukrainian soil. lee's office did not respond to a request for comment, and crowley could not be immediately reached for comment. the out-of-context video has been fact-checked by reuters and bbc journalist shayan sardarizadeh, among others.",2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.12806590646505356,0.83793705701828,0.0339970625936985,-0.2270283535261711,0,0,0,0,-0.4540567070523422,3.4690949189513223,17.0,0.2040644069971366
Opinion: The recipe for Ron DeSantis' success,2023-03-02,12.0,"the 2018 midterm elections were terrible for the republican party. the gop lost 41 seats in the house of representatives, and democrats beat gop candidates by more than 10 million votes — the largest raw vote margin in a house midterm election ever. democrats also gained seven governorships that year. despite those anti-republican hurricane-force headwinds, republican ron desantis beat democrat andrew gillum in the florida governor's race by 0.4%, or roughly 32,000 votes out of more than 8 million votes cast. in the 2022 midterm elections, the anticipated bright-red ""tsunami"" evaporated into a colorless mist. yet desantis scored an unprecedented victory for a republican in florida, beating his democratic opponent by more than 19 percentage points and 1.5 million votes. when republicans were asked who they would like to see as their party's nominee for 2024, a recent monmouth university national poll showed desantis even with former president donald trump in a hypothetical field of seven and ahead of him in a direct head-to-head matchup. a quinnipiac university poll found a near even race between biden and trump, with 48% supporting biden and 46% supporting trump, and a close race between desantis and biden, with 47% supporting desantis and 46% supporting biden. how has desantis gone from narrowly escaping defeat in 2018 to now becoming a formidable prospective contender for the white house? his rapid national ascent began during the early pandemic in 2020 when he became a hero to millions for filling a vacuum of leadership at a time of global crisis and uncertainty. vulnerable older adults in florida witnessed how he prioritized their health and safety by prohibiting transfers of patients infected with the coronavirus from hospitals into long-term care facilities, unlike in new york. parents of florida schoolchildren witnessed how he focused on keeping schools open, so students wouldn't fall behind in their learning. small-business owners witnessed how he battled to get and keep businesses open, so they and their employees could continue to feed their families during the pandemic. being the governor of tourism-rich florida meant that voters within the state were not the only ones who noticed or benefited from desantis' pandemic leadership. florida counted about 200 million visitors in 2020 and 2021. when visiting florida, millions of domestic tourists experienced florida's openness and returned home having personally experienced the benefits of desantis' leadership. desantis' governance style during the pandemic not only earned him respect from many around the country, but it also became a weathered template for other battles he has fought. here is the recipe for desantis' political success: step 1: take decisive action. this step follows a counterintuitive political principle that desantis gets: it's more important for a leader to be decisive than for the decision itself to be popular. voters do not want weathervanes for leaders. they appreciate a leader who takes bold action and gets things done much more than someone who constantly puts a finger in the wind, unsure of which direction to move next. step 2: when possible, take your most decisive actions on issues that unite republicans, divide democrats and appeal to independents. step 3: hope to be condemned by major news media outlets or scorned by elites in hollywood or university faculty lounges. step 4: stand your ground. do not back down. desantis' decisions on covid-19 are prime examples of how this recipe worked. he was decisive, even when public opinion started out against him. he was criticized in news reports and by editorial boards, public health experts including dr. anthony fauci -- then the nation's highest ranking government official on infectious disease -- and by biden. yet instead of hurting him politically, these criticisms only magnified desantis' street cred with so many americans who wanted a champion to stand up against lockdowns. the florida governor has followed a similar playbook on other issues -- from immigration to education issues. in september, desantis flew migrants from texas to martha's vineyard, where three municipalities had adopted sanctuary policies limiting local law enforcement from enforcing federal immigration laws. while editorials as well as local officials representing those sanctuary jurisdictions heaped scorn on desantis's decision, desantis was tapping into widespread national concern about the failure of border enforcement. more than half of americans believe it is completely or somewhat true that the united states is experiencing an invasion at the southern border, with 76% of republicans and 47% of independents holding this view, according to an npr/ipsos poll in august. meanwhile, 59% of democrats and democrat-leaning independents say border security should be very or somewhat important, and almost 4 of 10 democrats say that increasing deportations is very or somewhat important, according to a pew research poll. this widespread bipartisan dissatisfaction on border enforcement provided a vast political space for desantis' decision to relocate migrants. desantis also supported a bill that prohibited classroom instruction about sexual orientation or gender identity to kindergarteners and other young students. disney, a global entertainment conglomerate, opposed it and the hosts of the academy awards made fun of the bill on national television. but while hollywood kingpins and celebrities disapproved of the bill, a new york times-siena college poll in september found republicans united in opposition to such classroom instruction in first through fifth grades (95% against), while 42% of democrats strongly or somewhat opposed it. more interestingly, 71% of independent voters strongly or somewhat opposed classroom instruction of gender identity to children in elementary school, the poll found. desantis issued a proclamation declaring florida native emma weyant the winner of the ncaa division i women's 500-yard freestyle final after the ncaa declared lia thomas, a transgender woman, the victor. just like the other issues desantis has taken on, republicans and independent voters were strongly in favor of desantis' position, while democrats were split almost evenly, according to a npr/ipsos poll. regardless of whether one agrees with his policies or his politics, desantis has shown he has a recipe for political and electoral success that has made him the governor of red-state america as well as an effective critic of progressive democrats. in today's ""cancel culture"" environment, desantis has uniquely channeled the emotions of what former president richard nixon called the ""silent majority."" that term is more politically potent now than it was then, because those voters who consider themselves part of this group -- regardless of whether they are a majority -- feel more silenced than ever. one may be tempted to believe that such a strategy has limited appeal -- but consider the following: in 2020, although trump beat biden in florida, biden beat trump by 11 points among independent voters. yet two years later, desantis won back this important bloc of nonpartisan voters, winning a majority of independents and besting his democratic opponent by 8 points among independents. desantis' proven ability to galvanize republican voters and simultaneously appeal to a majority of independents is what makes him capable of winning both the gop presidential nomination as well as the general election, should he choose to run next year. it's a recipe that has worked brilliantly in florida -- an incredibly diverse, multicultural and fast-growing megastate. anyone who doesn't think it can work elsewhere may belatedly regret such skepticism in 2024.

Dueling CPAC and Club for Growth events highlight divide within GOP ahead of 2024,2023-03-02,13.0,"two dueling high-profile republican gatherings this week -- one featuring former president donald trump and the other florida gov. ron desantis -- showcase the deepening divide within the gop as it barrels toward its 2024 nominating process. trump is scheduled to headline the conservative political action conference in maryland this week along with several conservative stars who have pushed election conspiracy theories and are closely allied with the former president. meanwhile, desantis, who is expected to launch his own 2024 bid later this year, will skip the annual conference and is instead expected to be the main draw at the conservative group club for growth's private donor retreat in florida this weekend. club for growth, an anti-tax group at odds with trump, is one of the biggest outside spenders in republican politics. trump was the only major 2024 hopeful not invited to the group's palm beach donor retreat, which is expected to be attended by several potential 2024 republican candidates who have opted not to attend cpac. club for growth plowed $2 million into desantis' reelection campaign for governor last cycle, according to florida campaign filings. as the group focuses on desantis, it is also weighing launching a large-scale effort to boost an alternative to trump in four early voting states, according to a source familiar with the discussions. a club official said the organization was ""exploring a number of different strategies,"" but had nothing to announce yet. former vice president mike pence, sen. tim scott of south carolina, south dakota gov. kristi noem and new hampshire gov. chris sununu are not on the schedule at cpac but are expected to attend club for growth's event. all but sununu have previously spoken at prior gatherings of cpac, which has long been considered an essential stop for any potential presidential candidate working to build conservative support. some republicans linked the lackluster lineup at cpac to recent allegations against matt schlapp, the president of the american conservative union, which puts on cpac. a republican strategist who was working for herschel walker's senate campaign alleged that schlapp sexually assaulted him and is suing schlapp and his wife for more than $9 million. schlapp has denied the claims. ""it's a scandal,"" one republican operative who has worked on several presidential campaigns told cnn. ""if you are thinking about running for president and you're not donald trump, you can't afford a misstep. you can't afford to be linked to a scandal."" there will be some crossover at the dueling events, including republican presidential candidate nikki haley, who will fly to florida after speaking at cpac on friday, according to a haley spokesman. gop 2024 candidate vivek ramaswamy, an entrepreneur seen as a longshot to win the nomination, will also speak at both, per a source familiar with the planning. republican sens. ted cruz of texas and rick scott of florida, who have both said they're focused on their senate reelections when asked about 2024, will also attend both cpac and the florida retreat. former secretary of state mike pompeo and virginia gov. glenn youngkin were invited to the club for growth retreat but are unable to attend, according to a source familiar with the planning. the virginia state legislature concluded its session over the weekend but failed to reach an agreement on the state budget. pompeo is scheduled to speak at cpac, but youngkin is not. the rest of cpac's lineup features a slate of prominent election deniers and close allies of trump, including defeated arizona gubernatorial candidate kari lake, mypillow ceo mike lindell, rep. marjorie taylor greene of georgia, former white house chief strategist steve bannon, as well as trump family members donald trump jr. and lara trump. ""it's clear that the leftist media is on a search and destroy mission against cpac, its leadership, and the conservative movement,"" megan powers small, a cpac spokesperson, said. ""we could fill many more days of programming with all of the people who have requested to speak. any suggestion to the contrary is disingenuous."" club for growth and trump sparred during last year's primaries as they backed different candidates in key states holding senate primaries, including ohio. when it was reported last month that trump was not invited to the club for growth summit, the former president slammed the group as ""an assemblage of political misfits, globalists, and losers"" and as ""club for no growth"" on his truth social account.",9.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.411762199882004,0.44743609262837303,0.1408017236325476,-0.3441482759882403,0,0,0,0,-3.097334483894163,-1.4439626053628256,21.0,-0.06876012406489646
Biden's first-ever veto might be against the GOP war on 'woke' capitalism,2023-03-02,14.0,"joe biden could end up wielding the first veto of his presidency not on one of the great issues of state, but over a wonky skirmish sparked by the republican party's assault on what its culture warriors brand as ""woke"" capitalism. congress has sent to his desk a resolution overturning a labor department rule that allows managers of retirement funds to consider environmental and other factors when picking investments. the measure passed the democratic-controlled senate on wednesday with the votes of all republicans and two vulnerable democrats. and now biden has vowed to block it. the showdown might seem obscure, but it is a barometer of the kind of cultural backlash agenda that is certain to shape the tense politics of the next two years in divided washington and in the republican primary in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election. the strategy is the latest front in the republican party's self-described war on ""woke"" -- in other words, their efforts to attack some climate change and social or racial equity policies that they believe will fire up their most conservative voters, many of whom fear their vision of american is under attack. the gop is trying to define the next few years as a struggle between ""normal or crazy,"" as arkansas gov. sarah huckabee sanders characterized the divide during her response to biden's state of the union address. the resolution congress passed also shows how the gop is increasingly unmoored from its role as the party of corporate america and wall street, as it seeks to weaponize the cultural anxieties of its most committed voters in red states. investment firms had around $18 trillion in so-called environmental, social and governance assets in 2021, according to pwc, which allow fund managers to make investing decisions based on such non-financial considerations. the gop's assault on socially conscious corporations is being pioneered by florida gov. ron desantis, a likely 2024 contender who this week escalated his clash with the walt disney company over its criticism of one of his laws that limits certain classroom instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity for young children. the fact the anti-esg measure made it to biden's desk at all is one of the first illustrations of the delicate power balance in washington given the new republican majority in the house and the still fragile democratic edge in the senate. it passed the senate by 50-46 on wednesday with democrats hurt by the absence of pennsylvania sen. john fetterman, who is hospitalized for depression. two other democrats, sens. joe manchin from west virginia and jon tester from montana, voted with republicans, reflecting tough reelection races both are likely to face next year in states former president donald trump won by double digits. the resolution -- which, unlike major legislation, only required a majority to pass -- is likely to be the first of a flurry of republican efforts to pass measures that have no chance of changing policy but that carry a hefty political message. republicans slam 'liberal, left-wing agenda' republicans argue that the biden administration rule -- which reverses an attempt by the trump white house to prohibit the consideration of esg factors in investing -- would cost americans financially by reducing the value of their investments, including 401k pension plans. gop leaders also insist that investing based on environmental considerations could cost jobs in the fossil fuel industry, for instance. the biden rule, however, does not require investment managers to make such decisions; it merely allows them to do so if they are relevant to risk and return analyses. while the differences between the biden and trump rules are intricate, the issue has blown up because it offers the gop an opening to pivot to its broader claims that democrats are trying to embed liberal political principles in vast sectors of government, business and everyday life. ""what's happened here is the woke and weaponized bureaucracy at the department of labor has come out with new regulations on retirement funds, and they want retirement funds to be invested in things that are consistent with their very liberal, left-wing agenda,"" wyoming sen. john barrasso said on tuesday. senate republican leader mitch mcconnell of kentucky accused the administration of wanting to let ""wall street use workers' hard-earned savings to pursue left-wing political initiatives."" but biden has warned that american workers should have the ""fullest set of available tools"" to maximize returns on their life savings and pensions. he said in a statement threatening a veto that the trump-era rule got between investment advisers and workers and stopped plan managers from ""considering all factors relevant to investment decisions."" if biden vetoes the measure as expected, republicans are certain to charge that he has capitulated to extreme left-wing influences in the democratic party. but biden, adopting a populist tone, is criticizing the gop measure for limiting american workers' earning potential from their savings. democrats are also likely to charge that a far-right republican party is again demonstrating its cultural extremism and taking actions that could prejudice efforts to fight climate change and to foster racial equality. it is unlikely that there will be the sufficient two-thirds majority in the senate and the house to overturn biden's potential veto. there is one another candidate for biden's first presidential veto. republicans are working to rescind a controversial washington, dc, crime law that they argue is soft on violent offenders. a final senate vote on the measure is expected next week. manchin has already said he'd vote with republicans, while tester told reporters earlier this week he has not decided. the mantra that is taking over the gop the republican campaign against ""wokeness"" is often hard to define and, in some cases, is a rhetorical device rather than a coherent set of policy programs. often it is a mindset or definition that means different things to different people. but generally, it is employed by republicans to target the belief that there are systemic injustices in us society -- for instance, around race or sexuality -- and policy responses to try to mitigate them. more broadly, as in the case of esg investing, the gop war on ""woke"" policy is invoked to decry government or institutional efforts to make inclusionary or socially conscious decisions. in education, for example, republicans often target the teaching of gender and sexuality issues that they think go against conservative values. critics, however, often view such campaigns as attempts to create political wedge issues, which only end up hurting vulnerable individuals and groups. while attacks on ""woke"" policies are allied to the ideology of trumpism and his efforts to destroy government institutions, desantis has perfected the use of government power in what he's selling to conservatives as a defense of their values. among multiple efforts, desantis has used state power to prevent fund managers from using esg considerations in investment decisions. his new book, ""the courage to be free,"" which was published on tuesday, bristles with countless references to ""woke"" ideology. ""woke capital exerts a pernicious influence on society in several ways. first corporations politicize the economy when they leverage their economic power to take positions on issues that do not directly affect their businesses,"" desantis wrote. the florida governor also criticized what he sees as politicized companies that force employees to ""self-flagellate"" over concepts such as ""white privilege"" in diversity, equity and inclusion training. as republicans in congress pushed this campaign forward in washington this week, desantis escalated his duel with disney in florida, giving him more power over its special tax district. democrats have accused him of inappropriately using power in an act of personal and political revenge that pales in comparison with how he would use federal power if he ever makes it to the oval office.",5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.6288662612438202,0.13310911320149899,0.23802460441365839,-0.2021743428711411,0,0,0,0,-1.0108717143557056,-4.312407922308153,24.0,-0.17968366342950637
Opinion: Lori Lightfoot's fatal political mistake,2023-03-01,15.0,"four years ago, lori lightfoot captured almost 74% of the vote en route to an historic election as chicago's mayor. the first black woman and first lesbian to lead the city, the former prosecutor upended the political establishment with promises to clean up a city weary of corruption. but, on tuesday, lightfoot's reign came to a screeching halt in a manner as stunning and decisive as the landslide that swept her into office. lightfoot managed just 17% of the vote in a nine-way general election, failing to make the april 4 runoff that will now pit former school superintendent paul vallas against county commissioner brandon johnson. ""obviously, we didn't win the election today, but i stand here with my head held high and a heart full of gratitude,"" lightfoot told her supporters after the polls closed. ""you will not be defined by how you fall. you will be defined by how hard you work and how much you do for other people,"" she added. it was a classy and dignified concession from a pugnacious mayor who often seemed to favor the middle finger over the middle ground. lightfoot was smart, quick and always spoiling for fight, defending the city against its detractors -- from former president donald trump to sen. ted cruz of texas -- and anyone else who unfairly caricatured her city as an urban dystopia. she stood up for immigrants and worked to refocus resources to impoverished neighborhoods on the city's south and west sides. confronted with an unprecedented public health crisis within her first year in office, she generally won decent marks for her handling of it. but one element of that crisis -- the scourge of rampant violence that spiked during the pandemic -- contributed greatly to her repudiation at the polls on tuesday. crime -- a perennial issue that has bedeviled mayors for decades -- is far and away the top concern of chicago voters. and while she could claim some progress in the past year over 2021, lightfoot was widely considered a failure on the critical issue of public safety. her handpicked police chief, david brown, recruited from dallas, seemed overmatched in a city and a department often impenetrable to outsiders. and lightfoot's unwillingness to dismiss her police chief, who often seemed isolated from his officers and the community, left voters with little hope for change. (brown announced his resignation on wednesday following lightfoot's election loss.) but lightfoot's fall is a more complicated story that goes to a clenched-fist, go-it-alone style of leadership that made consensus hard to build and drove many who should have been her allies away. reared in the industrial belt of northeast ohio, the daughter of a factory worker and a health care aide, lightfoot fought her way up to the university of chicago law school and, ultimately, to the us attorney's office with a stint as president of the chicago police board. when she ran for mayor, her status as a crusading outsider with prosecutorial zeal was core to her appeal. but those pugilistic qualities quickly became obstacles in a job that often requires an ability to cajole, and not simply command. early in her term, lightfoot stubbornly took a teacher's strike many deemed avoidable, and then settled on the union's terms. deeply suspicious of the motives of other politicians, she systematically alienated gov. j.b. pritzker, the democrat-led state legislature and the cook county leadership, all of whom are fellow democrats. as a result, she lost key legislative battles, including a law that over the next three years will shift control of the chicago public schools from mayoral appointees to an elected 21-member school board, far larger than what she had wanted and the largest by far in the country. she ran on limiting the prerogatives of city council members, then humiliated them in her inaugural speech and alienated them in the job, prompting one of her once-allies alderman susan sadlowski-garza to say, ""i have never met anybody who has managed to piss off every single person they come in contact with. police, fire, teachers, aldermen, businesses, manufacturing."" the exodus of some high-profile businesses -- and the likely, unthinkable departure to the suburbs of the city's beloved chicago bears -- contributed to a sense of a city backsliding. by the time of the election, more than half of chicago voters gave the mayor negative ratings. in winning and losing, lightfoot did it her way. now chicago will have a new mayor -- and a race that will be the most ideologically divergent in recent history. vallas, who is white and endorsed by the fraternal order of police, ran almost exclusively on public safety and the promise to add officers to fight crime. he finished with 34% of the vote, far ahead of the field, but well short of the 50% necessary to win without a runoff. johnson, who is black, was relatively unknown to much of the city before being put forth by the chicago teacher's union, for whom he has worked as an organizer. once a vocal supporter of defunding police, johnson alone among the major candidates has eschewed promises of more cops. it is a stark choice and portends a pitched and divisive battle. fighter until the end, the mayor spent weeks of advertising, effectively hammering a fourth candidate she feared the most, us rep. jesus ""chuy"" garcia, only to be edged out for a spot in the runoff by johnson. now the reigning champion will be forced to watch from the sidelines and contemplate her meteoric rise and fall. lightfoot was elected as a loner -- an outsider -- and to a shocking degree, she will leave city hall the same way. an earlier version incompletely described the part of ohio in which lori lightfoot was raised.",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.5334053635597229,0.18698057532310486,0.27961403131484985,-0.991265592354476,0,0,0,0,-0.991265592354476,-5.979501122522956,20.0,-0.29897505612614783
A lot of conservative 'churn' as Fox News is unmasked,2023-03-01,16.0,"the painful truth about email and text messages, which every tv anchor and media executive should learn, is that you never know which message will be publicly released when your company is sued. it's especially painful if, as is the case for fox news anchors and executives, the messages appear to show you are knowingly allowing false information on the air. lawyers for dominion voting systems released portions of unflattering messages and depositions in court filings as part of their $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against fox for broadcasting conspiracy theories about dominion's role in the 2020 presidential election. that's how we know tucker carlson tried to get a fox news white house correspondent fired for fact-checking former president donald trump's false tweet about election fraud. ""please get her fired,"" carlson texted to fellow fox news anchor sean hannity. ""seriously ... what the f**k? i'm actually shocked ... it needs to stop immediately, like tonight. it's measurably hurting the company."" green was the most important color note that he said company. the fox leaders and top talent were focused on the company, not the country. democracy was at stake, but the larger concern at fox news appears to be that rival newsmax was gaining traction after trump lashed out at fox news for his 2020 election loss. fox corporation chairman rupert murdoch didn't mind the politics of putting the conspiracy theory-pushing mypillow ceo on fox news, he said in a deposition, according to court records. ""it is not red or blue, it is green,"" murdoch said, according to court documents. murdoch suggested firing the fox news washington bureau chief shortly after the network projected joe biden would win in arizona, which had caught network anchors off guard and put the election all but out of reach for trump. fox denies any wrongdoing and has accused dominion of cherry-picking quotes for its filing. there's a chicken or egg question in all of this did fox viewers question the election because of what they saw on the network, or did fox allow election falsehoods on its air because it feared its viewers? former house speaker paul ryan, who sits on the fox corporation board, sent an email to murdoch about the circular false information loop -- election deniers ""got a diet of information telling them the election was stolen from what they believe were credible sources,"" he wrote. 'scared to lose viewers' murdoch told ryan in one email that hannity had ""been privately disgusted by trump for weeks, but was scared to lose viewers."" cnn's oliver darcy has been all over this media story, which poses a real threat to fox's credibility, such as it is: read more about what we've learned from dominion's legal filing.read about what the lawsuit should mean for fox news in the future. but the epic unmasking of fox news also speaks to the tectonic movements on the american right wing. cnn's stephen collinson puts it perfectly: ""fox news is the latest example of opinion formers on the right exposed for being held hostage to the fury they helped to incite. ... the new details underscored how key players on the right feel they have no choice but to appease, satisfy and further inflame the voters and viewers on whom their profits or hopes of political power depend."" 'going through a lot of churn' darcy notes that ryan was grilled by a conservative commentator last week over his decision to remain on the board of directors of fox news' parent company. in the interview posted tuesday on the bulwark podcast, ryan said he believed fox news is ""gonna have to be a part of the solution if we're going to solve the problem in the conservative movement."" ""because there isn't a bigger platform than this in america,"" ryan said. ""so i think the conservative movement is going through a lot of churn and a lot of turmoil and i don't like where it is right now."" that churn among conservatives is more and more evident. what's the fox position on ukraine? during the george w. bush administration, fox would have been a major backer of military aid for ukraine if russia had invaded as it did a year ago. that perspective is still evident on the network, where many guests talk about the importance of ukraine aid. but its top stars, like carlson, are mimicking trump and questioning whether the us should be opposed to russia's authoritarianism and invasion of ukraine. florida gov. ron desantis, trump's current chief rival as they look ahead to the 2024 presidential race, represents the evolution in his own policy positions, as cnn's kfile notes: ""desantis wanted to send weapons to ukraine when he was a congressman -- as a presidential hopeful he questions us involvement."" skipping cpac trump will appear this weekend at the conservative political action conference, long a major stop for potential republican presidential candidates. the other major announced candidate, former south carolina gov. nikki haley, will also attend. but desantis, who is soft launching a nascent campaign, is skipping the event as he prepares promote his new book. he'll also pop into a private retreat for the anti-tax club for growth in palm beach, florida, where he can hobnob with donors, according to politico. failure to endorse trump's allies have been quietly trying to enlist hard-right lawmakers to back his third white house bid and give it some fresh momentum. perhaps surprisingly, they're running into some walls. cnn's melanie zanona and manu raju interviewed two dozen or so lawmakers that raju described as ""hardcore trump supporters, people who are part of the freedom caucus, people who were essentially his staunchest defenders during his four years in office."" ""many of them are just not yet ready to commit,"" raju told cnn's john king on ""inside politics."" they're interested in desantis and even haley and south carolina sen. tim scott. ""the overriding concern among republicans: they are concerned about trump's viability as a candidate,"" raju said. ""after he underperformed in the last three election cycles, they're worried that he could give joe biden another four years in the white house."" multiple members of the freedom caucus actually traveled to florida not to meet with trump, but instead to talk to desantis, according to raju. they were impressed. rep. ralph norman told raju the gop has ""the best stable of candidates ever,"" and he is endorsing haley, his fellow south carolinian. norman said he hopes other republicans back new candidates. ""it's called democracy,"" norman said. ""it's called the political process. when is it bad to get behind a candidate that you believe in?""

Takeaways from Attorney General Merrick Garland's Senate Judiciary Committee hearing,2023-03-01,17.0,"attorney general merrick garland appeared before a senate committee on wednesday, where he faced a colorful array of questions on everything from the federal investigation into hunter biden to the sale of deadly drugs, taylor swift tickets and fbi investigations. garland's nearly four-hour-long hearing before the democratic-controlled senate judiciary committee marked his first trip to capitol hill this year. it comes as investigations into president joe biden and former president donald trump have taken center stage in recent months. the attorney general's opening statement touched on topics like efforts to combat the rise of violent crime and hate crimes, work to protect reproductive freedom across the country, and the department's accomplishments in partnering with the ukrainian government against russian aggression. ""every day, the 115,000 employees of the justice department work tirelessly to fulfill our mission: to uphold the rule of law, to keep our country safe, and to protect civil rights,"" garland said, lauding efforts to protect ""our country's democratic institutions."" here are takeaways and key moments from the hearing: garland says he has not interfered in biden probe garland stressed that he will not interfere with the delaware us attorney's ongoing investigation into hunter biden that is focused on taxes and other issues. ""i have pledged not to interfere with that investigation, and i have carried through on my pledge,"" garland said, responding to questions from republican sen. chuck grassley on the probe. garland reiterated that the us attorney in delaware, david c. weiss, has ""full authority"" to carry out the investigation and to bring in another jurisdiction if necessary. garland said weiss ""is not to be denied anything that he needs."" he also said that it ""would be a national security problem"" if president biden's son had been receiving payments from a foreign government as a means to influence the administration. ""if it's an agent of a foreign government asking someone and paying someone to do things to support that foreign government in secret, yes, i definitely think that would be a national security problem,"" garland said. the questions reflect republican suggestions that the younger biden had made lucrative business deals because foreign governments were attempting to get to his father. hunter biden has denied criminal wrongdoing in his business activities. garland disavows memo referring to 'radical traditionalist' catholics garland disavowed an fbi field office memo that seemed to suggest the fbi was targeting ""radical traditionalist"" catholics, calling the memo ""appalling"" and saying the fbi is investigating its origin. ""it's appalling. it's appalling,"" garland said. the fbi ""has withdrawn it, and it's now looking into how this could ever happen,"" he added. garland continued: ""the fbi is not targeting catholics, and as i've said, this is an inappropriate memorandum. and it doesn't reflect the methods that the fbi is supposed to be using -- should not be relying on any single organization without doing its own work."" the memo was originally issued in a field office earlier this month and was almost immediately pulled. in one exchange during garland's hearing, republican sen. josh hawley of missouri asked the attorney general whether the department had informants in catholic churches. ""i don't believe we have any informants aimed at catholic churches,"" garland replied, adding: ""we have a rule against investigations based on first amendment activity, and catholic churches are obviously first amendment."" ""out department ... protects all religions and all ideologies, does not have any bias against any religion of any kind,"" he said. tense exchange over doj and parents garland at one point engaged in a tense back-and-forth with republican sen. john kennedy of louisiana about debunked claims that, under his leadership, the doj is trying to interfere with parents' ability to make complaints about schools. the claims stems from a 2021 letter from the national school boards association asking the doj to ""deal with"" the uptick in threats against education officials and equating that activity to ""domestic terrorism."" garland released a memo encouraging federal and local authorities to work together against the harassment campaigns levied at schools, but never endorsed the ""domestic terrorism"" notion. ""didn't you understand the chilling effect that it would have to parents when you issued your directive -- when you directed your criminal divisions and your counter terrorism divisions, to investigate parents who are angry at school boards and administrators during covid?"" kennedy asked. ""i did not do that. i did not issue any memorandum directing the investigation of parents who are concerned about their children,"" garland shot back, adding that to the contrary, the memo states ""that vigorous public debate is protected by the first amendment and the kind of concerns that you're talking about, as expressed by parents, are of course completely protected."" he later added: ""this is about the third time i'm being asked about the same memorandum and each time i've said, and i hope that the senators would go ahead and advise their constituents in the same way, that this is not what we do."" ""we are not in any way trying to interfere with parents making complaints about the education of their children,"" garland said. targeting online sale of deadly drugs judiciary committee chairman dirk durbin, an illinois democrat, pushed garland on whether social media companies should be liable for the illegal sale of deadly drugs, comparing their online sale to a ""suicide pact."" ""i don't want to put words in your mouth, but i think section 230 has become a suicide pact,"" durbin said, referring to a section of the communications decency act that shields tech platforms from being sued over the content users post. ""we have basically said to these companies, 'you are absolved from liability, make money' ... and deaths result from it, and we have a responsibility."" garland agreed that ""we do have to do something to force (tech platforms) to provide information, to search their own platforms for sales of illegal drugs,"" and pledged that the committee has the doj's support in efforts to reduce the online sale of deadly drugs and target algorithms that may be boosting their sale. the attorney general added that the department supports ""a better way to get the social media companies, whether it's civil or criminal, to take these kinds of things off their platforms."" security for supreme court justices garland was grilled by utah republican sen. mike lee about the absence of charges -- after demonstrators protested for weeks in front of the justices' residences in the wake of the leaked opinion to overturn roe v. wade opinion -- under a law that prohibits ""picketing or parading"" in front of a federal judge's home. ""it is concerning to me,"" lee said. ""when you show up at the home of a public official, you're sending the message of implicit violence."" the attorney general said he did not know if the department had brought any cases under the statute. but, garland said, the ""thing that mattered"" was his move, after the leak of a draft opinion, to order the us marshals service to protect the justices and their homes 24/7. ""no attorney general ever ordered that before. and no justice department had ever done that before,"" garland said, adding that 70-plus us marshals were deployed for the protection of the justices. ""they are on site, but their priority job is protection,"" garland said. ""that is why when someone did come to assault justice (brett) kavanaugh, he had to walk -- go away from where they were, because there were two marshals in front of the house -- and eventually he self-reported (himself)."" how the us marshals handled the alleged assassination attempt against kavanaugh has been scrutinized. the man accused of attempting the attack was only apprehended after he texted his sister and she called 911, according to information released by local law enforcement. quoting taylor swift at least two senators brought up a controversy surrounding ticketmaster after the service failed to process orders for taylor swift's upcoming tour, leaving millions of fans unable to buy tickets or without their ticket even after purchase. the justice department has reportedly opened an antitrust investigation into live nation entertainment, the owner of ticketmaster. garland said that any concentrated industry is a ""problem for competition"" as he faced questions about the probe, and, quoting swift, said the department knows ""all too well"" about the importance of industry competition. he told senators that ""you can be confident that in all of our work, we approach it with an understanding that highly concentrated industries are a problem for competition."" not revisiting internal doj legal stances garland refused to commit to revisiting internal doj legal stances that are issued in opinions from the department's office of legal counsel, even if those stances have been rejected by federal judges. olc opinions do not carry the legal weight of a ruling from a court, but are binding across the agencies of the executive branch. critics of the olc's continued embrace of its positions -- and particularly positions asserting sweeping executive privileges -- say that it allows the white house to avoid scrutiny by lawmakers with years of litigation over congressional subpoenas. garland was questioned on the issue by sen. sheldon whitehouse, who pointed specifically to a ruling by justice ketanji brown jackson -- from when she sat on the federal district court in dc -- that rebuked the department's position that an ""absolute immunity"" precludes close presidential advisers from even appearing for testimony when subpoenaed by congress. ""you have olc opinions that appear to be flat out wrong by the determinations made by those whose job it is to say what the law is -- the article iii judge -- and there's no effort to ask them in that fairly unique circumstance to go back and ... fix it,"" said whitehouse, a democrat from rhode island. garland cited the resource constraints the olc faces and suggested that the office was more likely to revisit a position if it was deemed unlawful by the supreme court, or perhaps a federal appeals court. ""there are lots of judges who criticize olc opinions and the justice department,"" garland, who once sat on dc's federal appeals court, said. ""as a former judge, that's perfectly appropriate for article iii judges to do, but we have to allocate our resources to cases where -- which are active cases."" garland condemns 'divisive rhetoric' aimed at judges asked about a senator's comments criticizing the federal judge presiding over a blockbuster abortion case, garland condemned ""divisive rhetoric"" while stopping",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.19430717825889587,0.7770752906799316,0.028617503121495247,-0.4023455055456926,0,0,0,0,-0.4023455055456926,-10.06282925922378,27.0,-0.3726973799712511
Opinion: Ron DeSantis' new book offers a powerful warning to the US electorate,2023-03-01,18.0,"as is increasingly apparent in many of his public appearances, florida governor ron desantis is rather like donald trump, only without the charm. and that charmless demeanor seeps through his latest book, ""the courage to be free: florida's blueprint for america's revival,"" a grievance-laden tome written in advance of a presumed bid for the republican nomination in the 2024 presidential election. the question is, will it help his chances? that's unlikely. only fans or parties actively looking for someone to back in 2024 will read the book, and within a few months unsold copies will lie on the remainder tables, rubbing shoulders with mike pompeo's new memoir, ""never give an inch,"" or past examples of campaign self-advertisements such as ""a call to service"" by john kerry, ""a time for truth"" by ted cruz or even trump's ""crippled america."" i've read a number of these books and they're rarely good. nevertheless, desantis takes the usual dullness to a fresh level, redefining what cliched writing can sound like. it's one thing to offer the public a bit of wooden prose, but desantis gives us an entire lumber yard. i don't blame desantis entirely for that lousy prose. like most politicians, he's a busy man who will have likely farmed out the writing of his book to nameless minions. the governor doubtless talked at length to the ""hardworking team of literary professionals"" mentioned in his acknowledgments; these ghostwriters will have also had his speeches, social media feeds, appearances and policy papers to draw on. and we can be sure the governor read the book and approved of its contents before publication. so we must assume the ideas (and ""ideals"") in this book, such as they are, belong to him. that's not a good thing. as one might expect, the book runs through desantis' life and times, talking about his love of baseball and hard work; about his parents and their working-class roots in pennsylvania and ohio. they were italian-americans — a family of immigrants, although desantis has shown little interest in helping recently-arrived migrants on their american journey: he famously flew two planeloads, primarily comprised of venezuelan migrants, from texas to martha's vineyard in 2022, a cruel, calculated political stunt designed to embarrass the biden administration and liberal elites with their ""sanctuary cities."" that he would play politics with the lives of these poor souls doesn't, i fear, speak well for him -- nor that he performed throughout the ensuing media cycle with such glee. but this hard-heartedness is a core part and parcel of the narrative, which offers a litany of resentfulness. ""before my time at yale,"" desantis writes of his undergraduate years studying history at the ivy league school, ""i had never seen a limousine, much less a limousine liberal. those students who were the most strident in their leftism... came from the most privileged background."" he experienced ""unbridled leftism"" on campus, and this pushed him far to the right, where he has remained. everywhere in the book, one senses his rage against political correctness. he rails, on nearly every page, about ""the woke agenda"" that he sees permeating almost every level of life in america. in desantis' mind, a dire phalanx of ""woke"" fanatics is led ""by the likes of dr. anthony fauci,"" who is seen as public enemy #1. he devotes a whole chapter of this book to railing against dr. fauci and people who used the powers of the federal government to implement ""heavy-handed public health 'interventions'"" during the covid-19 pandemic. these measures did little, in the governor's opinion, to slow the course of the disease — rather, they ""destroyed livelihoods, hurt children, and harmed overall public health."" (the jury is probably still out on how desantis governed with regard to the pandemic. it's possible he had some good instincts at work.) the title of this book must surely be ironic: ""the courage to be free."" desantis is all about the restriction of freedoms wherever possible. he wants to cancel librarians who allow kids to read certain black or lgbtq writers and to fire tenured professors in the state university system who teach ""woke"" ideas. he wants to restrict the rights of women seeking abortions and those of lgbtq people seeking to live their lives. he hopes to punish corporations, such as the walt disney company, for criticizing his policies. again and again, desantis shows little interest in the first amendment — except when his own free speech is concerned. he seems not to have heard the great words of thomas jefferson, who wrote: ""our liberty depends on the freedom of the press, and that cannot be limited without being lost."" jefferson understood that we each have a right, even a patriotic duty, to speak without permission from the authorities. instead, desantis rails against the ""legacy media"" — by which he means the new york times, the washington post, the atlantic and so forth. these are ""the praetorian guard of the nation's failed ruling class, running interference for elites who share their vision and smearing those who dare of oppose it."" (i suspect he would, no doubt, wish to exempt rupert murdoch's media empire from this judgment.) so, if ""the courage to be free"" is a sign of things to come, desantis will likely hang his presidential campaign on efforts to find what he calls the ""pressure points"" in the system, finding ways to ""leverage"" his authority to advance his agenda. he's a lawyer, as he reminds us, educated at the famous harvard law school. if the book is any guide, he's going to use his lawyerly skills to dismantle our heritage and, in his orwellian manner, he's going to proclaim that he's freeing us by doing so. overall, i found the hectoring quality of desantis oppressive. he's a chilly man, with a heart of ice and — like so many politicians on both the right and left these days — full of resentments, grudges and the urge to destroy anyone who doesn't agree with him. the courage he claims for himself he would deny to many others. i shudder to think what he might do if handed the presidential bully pulpit. the good news, i suppose, is that the lack of charm this book illustrates could well severely limit his chances of success on the national stage.

Colorado discipline office moves toward ethics complaint against ex-Trump attorney for 2020 election gambits,2023-02-24,19.0,"the disciplinary office that regulates attorney conduct in colorado is taking steps toward potentially bringing an ethics complaint against jenna ellis, the lawyer who played a prominent role in former president donald trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 election. colorado's attorney regulation counsel, an independent office in the state, indicated last week that it had been authorized to prepare and file a formal complaint against ellis, according to a february 17 email provided to cnn by project 65, a group of bipartisan lawyers that is asking for disciplinary action against ellis and other pro-trump attorneys who tried to overturn and undermine the 2020 election. ""we expect the complaint will be filed within the next month or so,"" said the email, which was sent to the head of a group that asked the disciplinary office to investigate ellis. under colorado attorney disciplinary rules, the office still has the option to reach a settlement or stipulation with ellis at this point in the process, so it's not guaranteed that an ethics complaint will ultimately be filed against her. jessica yates, who runs the disciplinary office, told cnn that the office cannot comment on specific cases. the email was sent to michael teter, the managing director of the 65 project. ellis did not respond to cnn's attempts to reach her for comment. when the 65 project asked for the ethics investigation into ellis last march, she told cnn that she would not be ""intimidated by this dirty political maneuver to undermine the legal profession."" teter told cnn that the recent move by the disciplinary office ""demonstrates the seriousness of her misconduct in her attempt to overturn the 2020 election by abusing the court system and making fraudulent, baseless allegations."" ellis was the public face of many of trump's election-reversal gambits, working on trump's legal efforts as well as the failed bid to convince state legislatures to nullify president joe biden's win. several other trump-aligned lawyers have faced potential professional consequences -- including the possibility of suspension or disbarment -- for their post-election legal conduct. however, some of the bids to discipline those attorneys have run into roadblocks. the disciplinary action that was brought against sidney powell, who put forward some of the most outlandish false claims about the presidential vote, was thrown out by a texas judge on thursday. but an attorney disciplinary committee in dc made the preliminary finding last year that former trump lawyer rudy giuliani violated ethics rules for his work on a trump lawsuit that tried to throw out hundreds of thousands of votes in pennsylvania. there will be more rounds of appeal before that finding is finalized and a punishment is handed down, but the dc bar's disciplinary counsel has asked for giuliani to be disbarred. and jeffrey clark, the former justice department lawyer who tried unsuccessfully to get the department to validate trump's false voter fraud claims, is also facing attorney ethics proceedings in dc. if the attorney regulation counsel in colorado moves forward with a complaint against ellis, and there isn't a settlement, the matter will be go through rounds of proceedings in front of a disciplinary judge, including a potential trial-like hearing before a panel made up of the judge and two other volunteers. the decision by that panel can then be appealed to the colorado supreme court. the movement from the disciplinary counsel towards a complaint against ellis was first reported by colorado newsline.",6.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.9164210259914398,0.07243694877251983,0.011141995899379253,-0.9999999679806376,0,0,0,0,-5.9999998078838255,-13.940876603113665,21.0,-0.6638512668149364
Paul Ryan grilled for remaining on Fox board of directors amid election fraud revelations,2023-03-01,20.0,"former house speaker paul ryan was grilled last week over his decision to remain on the board of directors of fox news' parent company after damning court documents showed that the right-wing network knowingly peddled election lies to its audience. in the interview, conducted by conservative commentator charlie sykes at the university of wisconsin-milwaukee and posted tuesday on the bulwark podcast, ryan was asked how he could associate himself with a company that ""is pumping toxic sludge, racism, disinformation, and attacks on democracy."" ""do you have any responsibility?"" sykes asked. ""i do. i have a responsibility to offer my opinion and perspective and i do that, but i don't go on tv and do it, right. so i offer my perspective, my opinion, often,"" ryan replied. ""i'll just leave it at that."" sykes continued pressing ryan. ""is there a red line for you at any point where you said, ""'i cannot be associated with a company that does this'?"" ryan declined to directly answer the question. instead, ryan said, ""i want to see the conservative movement get through this moment. and i think fox is a big part of the constellation of the conservative movement.""

Fact check: Marjorie Taylor Greene falsely claims Biden administration is responsible for Michigan brothers' fentanyl deaths during Trump administration,2023-03-01,22.0,"republican rep. marjorie taylor greene of georgia falsely claimed tuesday that the biden administration is responsible for the fentanyl deaths of two young men who actually died during the trump administration -- and her congressional spokesperson profanely dismissed questions about the false claim as irrelevant. michigan mother and conservative activist rebecca kiessling testified to the house homeland security committee on tuesday about how her sons caleb, 20, and kyler, 18, had died on july 29, 2020, as a result of fentanyl poisoning from taking pills kiessling said they had mistakenly believed were safer pain pills. kiessling made an emotional plea for stronger federal action to prevent the importation of fentanyl over the southern border, claiming, ""you're welcoming drug dealers across our border!"" (fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid, is largely smuggled in by us citizens through legal ports of entry rather than by migrants sneaking past unprotected stretches of the border.) then, later in the day, greene tweeted a video of an exchange she had with kiessling at the hearing. but greene wrongly suggested in the tweet that kiessling had blamed the biden administration for the death of her sons. in fact, kiessling had explicitly told the committee the date of the tragedy, making clear that it happened with more than five months left in the presidency of donald trump. ""listen to this mother, who lost two children to fentanyl poisoning, tell the truth about both of her son's murders because of the biden administrations refusal to secure our border and stop the cartel's from murdering americans everyday by chinese fentanyl,"" greene tweeted. greene, who supported the trump presidency and has endorsed his 2024 run, has more than 2 million followers on twitter. cnn reached out to the spokesperson for her congressional office, nick dyer, on tuesday night to ask for comment on the false claim and to ask whether greene had any plans to delete or correct the tweet. dyer responded in an email by asking whether cnn thinks the many americans who have died from drugs under biden ""care about the details"" of this particular case. he added, ""do you think they give a f**k about your bullsh*t fact checking?"" unrelated to cnn's inquiry, a fact check notice was affixed to the bottom of greene's tweet later tuesday night through twitter's ""community notes"" crowdsourcing feature. the tweet had been viewed more than 3 million times before noon on wednesday. asked about the tweet, kiessling, an anti-abortion advocate who has been active in the republican party grassroots, noted in an email on wednesday morning that the number of fentanyl deaths increased sharply between 2020 and 2021. she argued that ""if the border had been secured during the obama administration when the federal government first knew of this issue, my sons would be alive today."" kiessling concluded: ""the whole of our federal government has failed, congress included."" us deaths from fentanyl and other synthetic opioids first spiked under obama in the mid-2010s, then continued to rise under trump and accelerated again during the covid-19 pandemic, including early in biden's presidency. there have recently been preliminary signs of improvement in us overdose-death numbers, though they remain much higher than they were in 2020 and earlier. greene's election lies greene's false tweet about the biden administration was not her only dishonest claim that day. at a tuesday meeting of congressional republicans' caucus on ""election integrity,"" greene castigated a georgia republican election official, gabriel sterling, who has repeatedly vouched for the integrity of the 2020 election in the state. greene's comments, which she also posted on twitter, featured a variety of lies that were long ago debunked by sterling and many others. greene falsely claimed that ""trump won georgia,"" though he lost by 11,779 votes, fair and square, in a state with a republican governor, republican elections chief and republican-controlled legislature. she falsely claimed that there were ""thousands of dead voters in georgia,"" though georgia elections officials have found only four such cases in the 2020 election to date and trump allies' claims about various other supposedly deceased voters have been disproven by cnn and others. and she falsely claimed that a video showed workers in atlanta's fulton county doing something nefarious while counting ballots, though the workers were simply doing their jobs and though false claims about the video have been debunked not only by sterling but by trump's deputy attorney general and a trump-appointed former us attorney in georgia, among others. greene has been persistently inaccurate about the 2020 election. dyer, greene's spokesperson, responded with a profane dismissal when asked for comment tuesday night about greene's latest false election claims.",7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.5432110838592052,0.33587613249463694,0.12091277872345277,-0.5495076241861787,0,0,0,0,-3.846553369303251,-13.478593798195822,20.0,-0.6739296899097911
"Near bomb-grade level uranium found in Iranian nuclear plant, says IAEA report",2023-03-01,23.0,"uranium particles enriched to near bomb-grade levels have been found at an iranian nuclear facility, according to the un's nuclear watchdog, as the us warned that tehran's ability to build a nuclear bomb was accelerating. in a restricted report seen by cnn, the vienna-based international atomic energy agency confirmed that uranium particles enriched to 83.7% purity -- which is close to the 90% enrichment levels needed to make a nuclear bomb -- had been found in iran's fordow fuel enrichment plant (ffep), an underground nuclear facility located some 20 miles northeast of the city of qom. the report says that in january, the iaea took environmental samples at the fordow plant, which showed the presence of high enriched uranium particles up to 83.7% purity. the iaea subsequently informed iran that these findings were ""inconsistent with the level of enrichment at the fordow plant as declared by iran and requested iran to clarify the origins of these particles,"" added the report. iran's stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60% had also grown from 25.2 kg to 87.5 kg since the last quarterly report, according to the confidential iaea report. the iaea report said discussions with iran to clarify the matter are ongoing, noting that ""these events clearly indicate the capability of the iaea to detect and report changes in the operation of nuclear facilities in iran."" in an exclusive interview with cnn's christiane amanpour on tuesday, iran's foreign minister hossein amir-abdollahian did not directly respond to a question on reports of the enrichment. amir-abdollahian said that the deputy director general of the iaea, massimo aparo, had visited iran on two occasions in the past weeks and that the iaea's director general rafael grossi has been invited to visit the country. ""we have a roadmap with the iaea. and on two occasions, mr. [massimo] aparo, mr. [rafael] grossi's deputy, came to iran in the past few weeks, and we had constructive and productive negotiations. and we have also invited mr. grossi to come and visit iran soon,"" amir-abdollahian told cnn. ""therefore our relationship with the iaea is on its correct, natural path."" last year, iran removed all of the iaea equipment previously installed for surveillance and monitoring activities related to the nuclear deal, formally known as the joint comprehensive plan of action (jcpoa). the move had ""detrimental implications for the iaea's ability to provide assurance of the peaceful nature of iran's nuclear programme,"" the iaea report stated. a us state department spokesperson on tuesday said the iaea report potentially poses a ""very serious development."" ""we are in close contact with our allies and partners in europe and the region as we await further details from the iaea on this potentially very serious development,"" added the spokesperson. under secretary of defense for policy colin kahl on tuesday said that ""iran's nuclear progress since"" the trump administration withdrew the us from the 2015 nuclear deal ""has been remarkable,"" adding that in 2018, when the us withdrew, ""it would have taken iran about 12 months to produce one fissile, one bomb's worth of fissile material."" ""now it would take about 12 days,"" he said. more than a year of indirect negotiations between the us and iran to try to restore the 2015 nuclear deal broke down in september 2022. tensions between the two countries only worsened after iran's crackdown on nationwide protests at home, and as tehran supplied russia with drones in the ukraine war. kahl said tuesday that the agreement is ""on ice.""",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.6616510152816772,0.28613412380218506,0.052214816212654114,-0.9996010363077333,0,0,0,0,-0.9996010363077333,-12.491941100247626,19.0,-0.6574705842235593
"Fox executives should be fired for 'proven misconduct' exposed in Dominion lawsuit, renowned Yale professor says",2023-03-01,24.0,"the fox corporation board has a huge mess on its hands — and it needs to work quickly to clean it up. that's according to jeffrey a sonnenfeld, the renowned professor and senior associate dean for leadership studies at the yale school of management. sonnenfeld told cnn on tuesday that the dramatic revelations brought to light by dominion voting systems' $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against fox news — showing it knowingly peddled election lies to its audience — are cause for serious concern that could threaten the parent company. the filings, he said, showed members of the fox corp board had failed to act to prevent misconduct by fox executives, and warned the disclosures will result in ""likely"" shareholder lawsuits, a possible sec investigation into ""deceptive practices of the board for conspiring to conceal known misconduct with material adverse impact,"" and the potential loss of insurance protection for the company's directors and officers. sonnenfeld, who has advised hundreds of ceos and recent us presidents, said the board should take immediate action, including the removal of high-ranking personnel, such as fox news chief executive suzanne scott, from their roles. a version of this article first appeared in the ""reliable sources"" newsletter. sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. ""the board has a duty to remove such officials for proven misconduct,"" sonnenfeld told cnn by email, explaining that peddling known election lies — as ""acknowledged in the company's own sworn testimony"" — damaged the outlet's corporate reputation. ""if the board does not act appropriately,"" sonnenfeld added, ""it shows a failure of management oversight and jeopardizes their own directors and officers insurance protection with such gross conscious failure of diligent management oversight."" a lack of action by the board could result in additional legal exposure to fox, sonnenfeld warned. ""murdoch 'only' controls 39% of the company so any of the 61% of the shareholders can sue for misconduct, failure of management oversight, and conscious inadequate diligence,"" he explained. in the latest dominion legal filing, it was revealed that behind the scenes, fox corp board member paul ryan pleaded with rupert and lachlan murdoch to prevent trump's bogus election claims from being broadcast to fox news' audience of millions. the former house speaker said that fox news should ""move on from donald trump"" and ""stop spouting election lies."" but sonnenfeld said ryan's actions were not enough. in fact, he said ryan's ""quiet dissent"" was ""cowardly, ineffective, and immoral,"" and pointed out that board members have certain responsibilities under corporate governance law in delaware, where fox is incorporated. ""the duties of loyalty and diligence are not to the management but to the owners,"" sonnenfeld said. ""by silently going along with misconduct about which they are aware, all directors, including paul ryan, are guilty of complicity through their complacency."" sonnenfeld said that if he were advising fox's board members, he would recommend an immediate investigation into ""how far, wide, and deep the misconduct ran -- with an outside, independent law firm reviewing the sworn testimony, now public, and conducting follow-ups."" sonnenfeld said that viet d dinh, fox's chief legal and policy officer, and kevin lord, chief human resources officer, ""should share whistleblower complaints and exit interviews with the board."" ""the investigation should be completed with a report to the shareholders by may 1 indicating what disciplinary actions will be taken,"" he said. sonnenfeld also said the directors and officers insurers ""should be contacted to see"" if board members ""are still protected."" nell minow, vice chair at valueedge advisors and expert on corporate governance, told cnn she agreed with everything that sonnenfeld said. minow said that she would tell concerned board members to ""contact their largest shareholders to hear their suggestions for new independent directors."" minow also recommended fox news immediately move to settle its case with dominion, ""even if it means changing the name from news to not news and daily free ads 10 times a day in prime time for 10 years about the integrity and reliability of dominion."" spokespeople for fox corp and fox news, which have claimed dominion has cherrypicked quotes to use against them, did not respond to requests for comment. fox news has previously said it was ""proud"" of its 2020 election coverage, which is a statement that only grows more remarkable by the day.",2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.9130889475345612,0.0581098897382617,0.02880116319283843,-0.9999999999999999,0,0,0,0,-1.9999999999999998,-8.4919412923638,15.0,-0.56612941949092
Fox learns the hard way about being beholden to the GOP base,2023-03-01,25.0,"""you can't always get what you want"" has long been the anthem to donald trump triumphantly walking off stage after his rallies. but the ex-president's entire political career, the modern republican party and a vast conservative media empire are based on the exact opposite premise of the rolling stones' song: giving the party base exactly what it wants to hear -- whether it is true or not. fox news is the latest example of opinion formers on the right exposed for being held hostage to the fury they helped to incite. extraordinary revelations this week from a defamation lawsuit by dominion voting systems showed that fox corporation chairman rupert murdoch admitted under oath that some of the channel's top stars endorsed false claims that the 2020 election was stolen as he tried to stop viewers from defecting. previous disclosures showed some of those fox hosts knew they were peddling lies but were worried they'd alienate their audience if they told the truth about trump's false claims. the new details underscored how key players on the right feel they have no choice but to appease, satisfy and further inflame the voters and viewers on whom their profits or hopes of political power depend. the gop's most fervent, constantly self-radicalizing voters have long led its leaders. gop luminaries who resist the tide, like former florida gov. jeb bush, ex-arizona sen. jeff flake and former wyoming rep. liz cheney, see their careers expire. those that buy in -- like florida gov. ron desantis or new york rep. elise stefanik, now a member of the house gop leadership team -- can rocket to prominence. but such a strategy can risk being turned into a faustian bargain. in fox's case, murdoch's testimony left the network in serious legal jeopardy and shredded its journalistic reputation. some media commentators would argue that murdoch's entire business model -- using television stations in his native australia and tabloid newspapers like the sun in britain, as well as fox news in the us -- has evolved from seizing upon and feeding political anger. and while he's more known for backing conservatives, murdoch has switched sides when business demands -- for instance, when the sun endorsed the british labour party's tony blair over the fading conservative party in a 1997 general election. there are also signs that the billionaire publisher may finally be getting buyer's remorse over trump given the headline in his new york post after the ex-president's low energy 2024 campaign launch in november, which read, ""been there, don that."" as he said in a deposition made public in a court filing on monday in the dominion case: ""it is not red or blue, it is green,"" referring to the color of a dollar. republicans know where their power comes from the republican politicians who appear on fox are influenced by a similar calculation of what the political market will bear. their unfiltered adoption of much of the doctrine favored by the conservative grassroots ultimately stretched american democracy to the limit. catering to that base helped fuel the rise of trump in 2016, as he shattered the republican establishment presidential field. gop lawmakers whose hold on power depended on not crossing the reality-star-turned-president then allowed trump to run riot. that helped foster an unstoppable radical tide that led to the us capitol insurrection in 2021 and eventually to republicans acquitting him in not one but two impeachment dramas. there is every sign that the dominance of this republican base still reigns supreme as a new gop presidential campaign dawns. trump is still the biggest name in the race, but his top potential rival is expected to be desantis, who bills himself as a hardline leader who can implement trumpism better than its author but without the chaos that enveloped his presidency. in interviews with roughly two dozen members of the house's ""maga"" wing, many told cnn's melanie zanona and manu raju that they were not yet ready to commit to trump -- although there was excitement on the far right about desantis. the huge power of the republican base was the secret sauce that forced new house speaker kevin mccarthy to make concessions to the most radical representatives in the conference after 15 rounds of voting he needed to win his job. mccarthy had earlier watched as two predecessors, former speakers john boehner and paul ryan, tried to resist the gop's far right insurgency and lost their job. as mccarthy showed by handing fox host tucker carlson access to hours of capitol hill security footage last week -- despite carlson's conspiracy theories about january 6, 2021 -- his speakership is a totally owned subsidiary of the gop's most extreme elements. mccarthy's dominance by the same gop base that murdoch worried about driving away is one reason why a coming showdown with the white house over raising the government's borrowing limit has so many financial experts fretting about a possible default that could rattle the global economy. there are also signs that the power of the republican grassroots is leading the gop down a dark and futile road. the party that defeated soviet communism now spends its time undermining us democracy. trump's lies about election fraud -- amplified by fox and other conservative networks -- delight activists but scare off many moderate and suburban voters, who have contributed to the gop's loses in key swing states in recent general elections. following trump's defeat in 2020, there's a major question whether the no-compromise populism that the base demands can win national elections. the straddle between winning a party's base voters and trying to court middle america has long tested democratic and republican nominees when they have to pivot to a general election. in 2024, this political leap may require supreme political skill from whoever emerges from what could be the gop's ""america first"" primary. what trump and murdoch understood and most republicans didn't trump's astute political insight in 2016 was to see what no other republican candidate did -- that his winning coalition was angry and frustrated by years of foreign wars and globalized trade policies that many blamed for sending industrial jobs overseas. these voters were tired of conventional politicians and despised ""elites"" in business, politics and the media who they thought condescended to them. they also balked at political correctness and a wave of social and cultural change, permissive immigration policies and the diverse coalition that secured two terms for president barack obama. they wanted to send someone to washington to break all the rules and to drain what trump referred to as ""the swamp."" this was why trump, an apparently unlikely clarion of the people after spending his life in manhattan and flying around the country on a private boeing with gold-plated fittings, was the perfect candidate for the moment. he was condemned by liberals for his extreme, racialized and sometimes profane rhetoric. but for his crowds, trump's early rallies were huge fun -- more like stand-up comedy shows than conventional presidential events. here was someone who was shouting out loud what millions of americans had believed for years but felt constrained from saying because of social convention. many commentators decried trump's demagoguery but fewer examined the social, economic and political reasons for his rise. desantis in his new book explains the changes in the gop base that led to trump and that the florida governor will seek to harness if he makes a run for president in 2024. ""this persistent theme — that republicans in washington fail to effectively represent the values of the people who elect them -- foreshadowed the nomination of donald trump in 2016,"" desantis writes in ""the courage to be free,"" published on tuesday. ""the chasm between the aspirations of the gop voter base and the behavior of party leaders in washington would continue to grow wider in the ensuing years."" desantis complains that politicians who go to washington forget where they come from -- and soon become instruments of a political system that works against their constituents' interests. yet issues like the need to raise the debt ceiling to keep the government solvent and the economy running or key foreign policy questions, like us support for ukraine, sometimes require leaders to take a different view of the national interest than prevails back at home. many politicians face a moment when, for reasons of conscience or political reality, they risk alienating their closest supporters. but sometimes there is no choice but to spend this political capital. the key to trump's appeal, however, is that he never did. the ex-president's tearing at democratic norms after the election in 2020 was his version of telling voters what they, and he, wanted to hear. he allowed millions of americans to believe that he had not lost to president joe biden and that the election was stained by widespread fraud -- even though there was no basis for his claims. the fox news opinion hosts who amplified his falsehoods were guilty of exactly the same transgression -- not to protect political careers but apparently to save their lucrative livelihoods. trump had foreshadowed this marriage of convenience between his presidency and the conservative media infrastructure in an appearance at the annual veterans of foreign wars convention in kansas city in 2018. ""stick with us. don't believe the crap you see from these people, the fake news. ... what you're seeing and what you're reading is not what's happening,"" he said.",18.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.5284208872665962,0.15557364783146316,0.31600546408703345,-0.2209220313413186,0,0,0,0,-3.976596564143735,-10.468537856507535,31.0,-0.3376947695647592
Biden administration embraces tough border measures it once rejected,2023-03-01,26.0,"facing a surge of migrants at the us-mexico border and on the heels of a crisis, white house and department of homeland security officials began discussing more restrictive policies that would keep migrants from coming to the us. it was the summer of 2021, just months after a surge of unaccompanied migrant children caught the administration flat-footed and put into sharp focus the immigration challenges ahead for president joe biden. at the time, white house lawyers knocked down one of the ideas: forcing asylum seekers to find refuge in countries on their way to the us or be turned back. they said it would likely be blocked by the courts, according to two sources familiar with the discussions. but nearly two years later, the administration announced a policy like the one floated among officials before -- fielding fierce criticism from allies who argued the effort had echoes of the trump era and crystallizing the shift in biden's approach to the border, a political vulnerability going into the 2024 presidential election. ""as a matter of good governance, we take all legal considerations into account before putting any policy forward, and the recent proposed rule reflects those considerations,"" an administration official said in a statement. one source close to the white house described the latest policy announcement, which largely bars migrants from seeking asylum in the us if they passed through another country, as ""putting lipstick on a pig."" the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic in the western hemisphere put the biden administration in a difficult position from the outset, as migrants began fleeing deteriorating conditions back home in record numbers. proposals to reform the immigration system fell by the wayside as officials grappled with a record number of migrants arriving at the us southern border, sources told cnn. but policy ideas, like the new asylum rule, that may have been hard to stomach before are now taking shape as the administration tries to stave off another crisis and republican attacks. ""they went from not wanting to do tough stuff to realizing they have no choice,"" one source familiar with discussions told cnn. cnn reached out to the white house and department of homeland security for comment. some biden allies have likened the new asylum rule, which is likely to take effect in may, to a trump-era policy that sought to bar migrants from seeking asylum at the us-mexico border. biden administration officials have rejected the comparison to the trump administration, saying that it's not a categorical ban on asylum and emphasizing efforts to expand access to legal pathways to the us, including a recently launched parole program for certain nationalities. ""this was not our first preference or even our second,"" an administration official previously told reporters, stressing efforts to open legal pathways to the us, including use of an app, and underscoring the onus is on congress to pass reform. the shifting migration patterns -- which have put a strain on federal resources -- have in part prompted the administration to consider new measures, especially as border authorities have encountered an increasing number of cubans, venezuelans and nicaraguans. the us is largely barred from deporting migrants from those nationalities back to their home countries because of strained diplomatic relations. the us has since begun sending migrants from cuba, venezuela and nicaragua to mexico under a covid-era border restriction, known as title 42, and opened a separate program that allows migrants of those nationalities and haiti to apply to legally come to the united states. thousands of migrants have already applied, and border encounters of those nationalities have dropped significantly. immigrant advocates and former biden officials have slammed the return of migrants to mexico and the latest policy rollout, calling it a pivot from biden's pledge to restore asylum. biden has long promised to take a humane approach to the situation at the border -- a promise that some critics say the current white house could risk breaking with some of their restrictive border policies. ""the original sin was relying on president trump's title 42 instead of taking the early hits to get out of it and build legal pathways to relieve pressure off the border,"" said alida garcia, vice president of advocacy at fwd.us and a former white house official. ""now, we're left with this terrible mess that is only going to increase children crossing on their own and empower cartels,"" garcia added. the balance of power within the white house over immigration has also changed over the last two years, with progressives largely leaving the administration and people with more moderate positions having more influence. in the first months of the administration, there was often disagreement among moderates and progressives within the administration about how to address migrants at the border, leaving little room for solutions or decisions. the management of the us southern border not only exposed fractures within the administration but also within biden's own party about how to address an influx of migrants at the us-mexico border and a buckling immigration system. following last week's announcement, multiple democratic lawmakers immediately criticized the move to restrict asylum. ""i am deeply outraged by the biden administration's proposed ban on asylum seekers,"" said democratic rep. jamaal bowman of new york in a statement. ""our immigration policies already fall short in supporting asylum-seekers, but this ban would go further by attacking the very bedrock of our most basic commitment to asylum."" democratic rep. henry cuellar of texas, who has previously been a critic of biden's management of the border, argued that providing incentives for people to follow a lawful pathway to the us is important to avoid a surge at the border. ""they have shifted. it looks like there's a movement to the middle,"" cuellar said of the biden administration. ""i think that's good policy, especially for people at the border."" ""you have to have something in place. you have to have policy in place when title 42 goes away may 11,"" he added. the administration has repeatedly called on congress to pass immigration reform, which hasn't happened in decades and has left presidents relying on a patchwork of policies to stem the ongoing flow of migrants. in the interim, the administration has leaned on title 42 to turn away certain migrants encountered at the us-mexico border. with the clock ticking on its expiration in may and amid ongoing litigation, officials are also considering other enforcement measures as tens of thousands of migrants continue to move in the western hemisphere. among the plans being considered by the administration is a fast-track deportation process known as ""expedited removal."" while mexico has been taking migrants under title 42 and previously under a trump-era border policy known as ""remain in mexico,"" the plan would appear to mark the first time mexico would take back non-mexican deportees at a large scale. the department of homeland security has denied reports of the plan.",5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.49481586515903475,0.3545487530529499,0.15063538514077662,-0.5356802160942787,0,0,0,0,-2.6784010804713936,-13.501152050226112,33.0,-0.4091258197038216
House's MAGA wing torn over Trump as loyalists eye other 2024 candidates,2023-03-01,27.0,"former president donald trump's allies have been privately lobbying hard-right house members to throw their support behind his bid for the gop 2024 presidential nomination and help inject some fresh momentum into his fledgling campaign, according to republican sources. but trump has his work cut out for him. in interviews with roughly two dozen members of the so-called maga wing, encompassing some republicans who were among his staunchest allies during his four years in office, many told cnn they were not yet ready to commit to trump. some were keeping their options open as the field develops and others were privately worried that trump would implode and hand president joe biden another four years in office. and several seem more open to embracing one of trump's potential opponents, whether it's florida gov. ron desantis, south carolina sen. tim scott, former vice president mike pence or even former south carolina gov. nikki haley, who won the support of one hard-right house freedom caucus member as she announced her bid for the nomination earlier this month. ""there's a lot of good candidates and i want to take a look at"" them, said rep. ken buck, a colorado republican and house freedom caucus member who broke with trump over certifying the 2020 election. one overriding concern: whether trump could actually win in 2024 given that the gop lost control of the house in 2018 during his tenure, then he lost in 2020 and witnessed the 2022 failure of republicans to recapture the senate majority after several trump-backed candidates collapsed in the general election. ""yeah, that's a concern,"" said rep. tim burchett, a conservative tennessee republican who is neutral in the race when asked about trump's performance in the last three cycles. ""a lot of times, our leaders, maybe their morals aren't where we need them to be, but the leadership skills and putting people in place are, so that's kind of what everybody's concerned about."" the apprehension over trump inside the freedom caucus -- a group that evolved from a conservative policy-centered crew to a trump fan club over the years -- is emblematic of the broader reservations inside the gop over trump's electability. and it underscores the larger challenge that the former president faces to win back his coalition as many gop officials -- and voters -- are eager to see a fresh face despite their support of his actions in office. and while there's still plenty of love and respect for trump on the far right, behind the scenes, there's particular excitement over desantis, a founding member of the freedom caucus. desantis privately met with members of the group earlier this month and held a fundraiser in west palm beach, florida -- trump's turf -- over the weekend, where several gop lawmakers were in attendance. ""it's no secret that i was in west palm this past weekend. i'm pretty impressed with the governor,"" conservative rep. chip roy, a texas republican, told cnn. ""i'm going to do what i think is right, based on what is appropriate for the 750,000 people that i represent. that's who i owe my allegiance to -- not any individual, certainly not any politician."" rep. byron donalds of florida, a member of the freedom caucus, had praise for both desantis and trump but said he would wait to see the field set before taking a position on the candidates. ""we don't do lockstep politics on our side of the aisle,"" donalds said. ""so everybody's gonna make a decision of who they want to support early."" but if desantis indeed runs for president, it could benefit donalds, who told cnn he'd be interested in running for governor of the sunshine state. ""yeah,"" donalds said when asked if he's open to running for governor. as trump eagerly watches to see who endorses him, members of the freedom caucus trekked down to florida over the february congressional recess for a conservative policy conference, where they met with desantis. the governor, who just won a second term last fall, addressed the freedom caucus during the conference, and afterward, a number of gop lawmakers posed for pictures with desantis and posted them to social media with glowing captions, raising some eyebrows in gop circles. ""it was great for the freedom caucus to get to meet him and hear about all the good work he's doing in florida, that we would love to replicate,"" said rep. ben cline of virginia, a member of the freedom caucus. ""we're blessed with a deep bench. and while trump is the favorite, i'm watching the field develop."" speaker kevin mccarthy, who credited trump with helping him win the gavel, has yet to weigh in on the burgeoning presidential primary field. and some gop lawmakers, including rep. scott perry of pennsylvania, the head of the freedom caucus and staunch trump defender during his time in the white house, refused to answer any questions about the presidential primary. ""i've got way too many things to worry about, be concerned about, before i get into that,"" perry told cnn. others were similarly mum. ""that's way above my paygrade,"" said rep. dan bishop, a conservative from north carolina, when asked about his favorite in the presidential race. ""i'm just an obscure backbencher."" and at least one prominent trump backer -- rep. ralph norman of south carolina, who once called for using martial law to keep trump in office -- has already thrown his weight behind haley, the only other major republican candidate to officially jump into the race so far. ""my feelings, at the end of the day, is we have to win the white house in '24 to stop the insanity that's playing out before our very eyes,"" norman told cnn. ""nikki has the skills, personal magnetism, fighting spirit, bold decisive, street sense that will excite young, old, independents to go to the polls, and this will be evident over the next 8 to 10 months."" asked whether he's worried about possible blowback from trump, norman said he had a pleasant phone call with a ""benevolent"" trump about his endorsement -- and made clear his decision to back haley was not a personal slight against the former president. but norman said he hopes other conservative house republicans will back candidates besides trump. ""i hope so, it's called democracy,"" norman said. ""it's called the political process. when is it bad to get behind a candidate that you believe in?"" others are torn. ""there's a lot of people excited about desantis. ... and a lot of us have been friends with him for a while, before he even became governor,"" one freedom caucus member told cnn, who predicted the governor would rack up some congressional endorsements once he officially gets in the race. ""but we also like donald trump. so for a lot of us, it's especially tough."" to be sure, trump has his fair share of loyal allies on capitol hill. a number of republicans have already pledged their support to trump, including reps. elise stefanik of new york, jim jordan of ohio and lauren boebert of colorado. and more are expected to follow suit, especially since trump has built a lot of goodwill on capitol hill through playing in primaries. ""i'm with trump out of the gate. i like ron and several of the other guys too, but i'm with trump out of the gate,"" said rep. clay higgins of louisiana. ""i endorsed him day one. i'm all in,"" added rep. ronny jackson of texas, a former white house doctor who worked with trump. still, the number of congressional endorsements is something that has been on the former president's mind. people involved with trump's political operation have been whipping lawmakers on capitol hill to publicly back trump, with a particular focus on the florida members, a senior gop source told cnn. ""trump is very much paying attention to who endorses him,"" the source said. ""because it matters right now."" the house freedom caucus showed serious signs of splintering earlier this year during the drawn out battle over speaker, with around half the group initially refusing to back mccarthy for the gavel, even though he had trump's support. in the end, five house republicans -- including rep. matt rosendale, who is considering running for senate in montana -- voted ""present,"" allowing mccarthy to clinch the speakership. but not before a chaotic episode on the floor, where rep. marjorie taylor greene of georgia tried to get rosendale to talk to trump on her cell phone. rosendale refused -- but insisted it's because he didn't want to break the rules, not because he didn't want to speak to trump, who endorsed rosendale in the past. ""there's rules that prohibit using the phone on the floor,"" he told cnn. asked whether he'd back trump's presidential bid, rosendale said: ""i don't do endorsements -- not through primaries.""

Opinion: Who's stopping the government from giving Americans relief from crushing student loans,2023-03-01,28.0,"president joe biden is trying to give the millions of americans saddled with student loan debt some relief. republicans, and the supreme court, may not let him. after biden took office last year, his administration announced a plan to discharge hundreds of millions of dollars in student loans in a program that would forgive as much as $20,000 per borrower. biden did this thanks to the higher education relief opportunities for students act of 2003, or the heroes act, which allows the secretary of education to change or get rid of student debt in the context of ""a war or other military operation or national emergency."" a pandemic is clearly a national emergency, a position former president donald trump also took when he paused student debt payments in 2020. biden expanded upon that, putting loans back into repayment starting in july, but also putting forward a plan to forgive rather than just pause at least some debt. many of the more than 43 million americans saddled with some $1.75 trillion dollars in student debt were thrilled. many republicans cried foul. six republican governors and two debt holders filed lawsuits challenging the policy. their argument is essentially that this program is beyond the scope of biden's power; he's using covid as a pretext, they say, for a law that should be approved by congress. on this point -- and in much of the case -- the court's conservative justices seemed sympathetic during tuesday's oral arguments in the two challenges to biden's plan. the case ""presents extraordinarily serious important issues about the role of congress,"" chief justice john roberts said, adding, ""we take very seriously the idea of separation of powers and that power should be divided to prevent its abuse."" he has a point: the us government was indeed set up to separate and balance powers, and to avoid unilateral executive action -- the founders gave us a president, not a king. but congress also gave us the heroes act, which explicitly gives the president the authority to cancel student debt in the case of a national emergency. the pandemic was clearly a national emergency. there are often a lot of ""really confusing"" statutes that come before the court, justice elena kagan said, and ""this is not one."" clearly, congress intended for the president to have the power to waive student debt in a national emergency; can it really be the case that the president was given that power, but he's not permitted to use it without congress weighing in? the conservative judges seem to say yes. this is a case that may fall apart before the judges even get to the real meat of it, thanks to standing issues with the plaintiffs. in order for a court to hear a case like this one, the individuals or entities suing have to have suffered some actual harm -- they can't just dislike a law or policy, they have to be negatively affected by it. the court will first have to consider if the republican governors who are suing have met the threshold to sue in the first place. whatever the outcome, this case will be a political win for the biden administration. the optics are clear: democrats want to forgive your student loans; republicans are willing to go all the way to the supreme court to stop them. if the republican governors win, though, and the student loan forgiveness program is scrapped, the real losers will be indebted former students, not the gop. student loan debt is crushing, and it has exploded in the last few decades. according to the education data initiative, while the average borrower takes out $30,000 in loans to pay for a bachelor's degree, the average federal debt owed is more than $37,500, and the average private student loan debt is a whopping $54,921. and all debt is not created equal. students who take out loans to get, say, business degrees from top universities find themselves in a very different position from students who attend predatory for-profit institutions and wind up with degrees that aren't worth all that much -- if they end up with degrees at all. a great many students who take out student loans don't graduate, leaving them in the worst of all positions: in debt, but with no degree to show for it. these students -- those who are indebted but don't have a diploma -- are typically vulnerable in many other ways. borrowers who default on their loans are much more likely than students who graduate to be first-generation college students, to be black or hispanic, to have attended a for-profit school, and to have never completed their degree. while biden's loan forgiveness plan would benefit many people with student loan debt -- myself included -- it's the borrowers who never graduated or who went to predatory institutions that are currently being hurt the worst, and would see the greatest benefit by having a chunk of their debt knocked off. struggling with student debt -- or worse, defaulting and seeing your entire financial life take a huge hit -- is part of what keeps so many americans living in a state of precarity. millennials, the oldest of whom are now in our 40s, have been notoriously reluctant to have children, late to marry, and unable to save for homes. student debt isn't the only driver of these shifts -- much of it is cultural as much as economic -- but beginning your adult life owing tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars does not exactly create a stable foundation on which to build a life. to add insult to injury, an 18-year-old who spent four years racking up credit card debt buying luxury cars, wearing designer clothes and going on exotic vacations can discharge that debt in bankruptcy. an 18-year-old who signed a $100,000 loan agreement at 7.5% interest because it was their only way to pay for school cannot. the biden student loan forgiveness program is far from perfect. it doesn't do nearly enough to ensure that we aren't going to be right back here a few years down the road. it is arguably not generous enough to the most in need and too generous to the white-collar professionals who can afford to pay off their loans. and liberals should have real concerns about executive overreach. but we should be concerned about overreach from a conservative supreme court, too, as well as a student loan system that places heavy financial burdens on young people as soon as they embark on their adult lives. the republican talking point on this case is that biden's plan is a massive taxpayer giveaway, and that he cunningly used covid as an excuse to push through a policy congress would have never approved. so it's worth asking republican politicians: why won't congress act to relieve student loan debt — even if it means making the uber-wealthy and large corporations pay more in taxes — and improve the economic and personal futures of so many young people? the gop opposes biden's student debt relief plan, and members of the party are so against it that they're willing to take it all the way to the supreme court. voters like me, who still carry significant student debt that has very much impacted my financial wellbeing and curtailed my ability to save for little things like ever being able to retire, want answers from the gop: if you're willing to fight student loan forgiveness in front of the supreme court, why aren't you willing to fight for the millions of americans who are being crushed by the debt we needed to take on to get our degrees?",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.18330812454223633,0.32417353987693787,0.4925183355808258,0.9568904078644834,0,0,0,0,0.9568904078644834,-3.676640285583988,58.0,-0.06339034975144807
The fastest growing metro in the US is looking to a shrinking reservoir to keep the boom going,2023-02-28,29.0,"in a bright-red county in a state allergic to regulations, there is a ban on growing grass outside new businesses. only 8% of a home's landscaping can have a grass lawn in this booming corner of utah, about a hundred miles northeast of las vegas. and if any developers want to add another country club to this golfing mecca, ""i don't know where they would get the water from,"" said zach renstrom, general manager of the washington county water conservancy district. ""and i'm telling you, i know where every drop of water is."" like lots of spots in the west, the combination of more people and less water makes for an uncertain future around st. george, utah. while this winter's generous snowpack could buy precious time, the entire colorado river system remains in danger of crashing if water gets too low at lakes powell and mead. but that reality hasn't stopped st. george from booming into the fastest growing metro area in the us two years running, according to the us census bureau, and renstrom says that unless utah builds a long-promised pipeline to pump water 140 miles from lake powell, their growth will turn to pain. in the meantime, lake powell -- the country's second-largest reservoir -- has struggled to serve even the places it currently provides water to. last week it sank to the lowest water level since the reservoir was filled in the 1960s, and since 2000 has lost more than 150 feet. ""if we stop construction water, that act alone would lay off about 20% of our county,"" renstrom said. ""we've made a commitment that we're going to make sure to be good stewards of every single drop of water that's already here and make sure we're utilizing that. but when we look at our long-term growth and you know how much water we need, (the lake powell pipeline) is still in our long-term plan.""washington county said it consumed about 50,000 acre feet of water in 2022, all of it supplied by the virgin river which flows into the colorado system and out of taps from vegas to la. an acre-foot is the amount of water needed to cover one acre to the depth of one foot -- roughly 326,000 gallons. a plan to pump 80,000 acre feet of water a year from lake powell to sand hollow reservoir passed the utah legislature in 2006 and met immediate opposition from environmental groups worried about fragile desert ecosystems. fourteen dry years later in 2020, the trump administration tried to fast-track the project's environmental review but water managers from the other six colorado river basin states banded together to block it. ""the system is crashing and to be honest, it's kind of incomprehensible to think of a diversion of that size that would serve 200,000 people in one county in southern utah at this moment in time. there's just not the water,"" matt rice, southwest region director of the nonprofit american rivers told cnn. ""we're worried about every molecule of water that that we can deliver to lake powell and lake mead to protect critical hydroelectric infrastructure."" while in legal limbo, the controversy brought fresh headlines in january when the mayor of the small washington county town of ivins called it ""the lake powell pipe dream"" during a public meeting. ""shame on me,"" ivins mayor chris hart laughed about his words as he welcomed cnn to ivins, proudly pointing out the irrigation-free desert xeriscape around the new city hall. ""the motivation for that comment is that this project has faced a lot of obstacles and continues to with the shortage impacting all of the basin states,"" hart explained. ""there are groups who believe that we can that we can work our way out of it through conservation and other ways. the studies show us that eventually the lake powell pipeline will be necessary for us to continue to develop in the county. so, i actually used that word tongue-in-cheek, because the serious side of it is that it is an essential part of our plan."" hart also said it's utah's turn to grow, after the growth in california, arizona and nevada. ""they've had their enormous growth spurts through the years and the water has been made available for them to do that. and now here we are,"" he said. ""i think our perspective, from the state of utah, is we're entitled to that, to our share, whatever that is,"" he said. hart and renstrom are evangelists for water conservation in a county allergic to rules and regulations and where 74% voted for donald trump in 2020. ""we're a red state and in utah, this is a red county. and so we like our independence, we like our freedoms,"" renstrom said. ""if i step in and say, 'i just want more government regulations,' it's immediately dead."" but renstrom has managed to help pass some of the strictest water laws in the west. ""it is causing a lot of friction,"" he said, ""because we're asking people that have had a certain type of lifestyle or a certain way of living and asking them to radically change that, to make sure that we have additional water for our economy. and it's hard."" rice at american rivers says a shift in mindset — especially among eastern transplants ignorant to living with drought — is vital to future desert survival. instead of focusing on the pipeline, he hopes desert leaders like mayor hart will tap into the unprecedented federal funding for water reclamation projects in both the bipartisan infrastructure law and the inflation reduction act. ""there's about $12 billion that could be deployed in the colorado river basin not only for municipal needs but agricultural needs and watershed restoration,"" he said. hart acknowledged that item is on the wish list. ""one thing that we haven't done a lot of here that vegas have become masters at is to recapture the water that flows through our buildings and run it through a treatment plant and then recycle it,"" hart said. ""so the few drops of rain that we get, if we can use them four or five times, that's a whole different thing than the drop of rain comes, you use it and off it goes down the river and it's gone.""",2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.09037094563245773,0.44821760058403015,0.4614114314317703,0.7474292891690391,0,0,0,0,1.4948585783380781,-0.18178170724591025,58.0,-0.0031341673663087973
Biden administration tells student loan forgiveness applicants it is 'confident' in face of Supreme Court skepticism,2023-02-28,30.0,"the biden administration is projecting confidence about the fate of president joe biden's student loan cancellation program in a message to applicants, even in the face of skepticism from conservative supreme court justices in tuesday's high-stakes oral arguments. education secretary miguel cardona said in an email sent to millions of borrowers who applied for debt cancellation that the administration ""mounted a powerful case"" in support of biden's executive action. ""our administration is confident in our legal authority to adopt this plan, and today made clear that opponents of the program lack standing to even bring their case to court,"" cardona wrote in the email update obtained by cnn. the email update to applicants reflects a position administration officials have maintained in the wake of the oral arguments. but it also implicitly lays out the administration's view of the political dynamics of a move that has became an immediate partisan flashpoint. as applicants and administration officials alike settle in for what will likely be months of waiting for a final decision, the update sent to roughly 7 million people also provides a window into the reach the administration would have to frame the debate -- and consequences -- should the program be struck down. cardona's message comes as millions of borrowers remain in limbo as they await a supreme court decision on whether biden's action to cancel up to $20,000 in student loan debt will stand. white house officials, who closely monitored the oral arguments in two challenges, have maintained the position that they will ultimately prevail in the cases that challenge biden's authority to discharge millions of dollars in federally held loans. while they remain confident on the merits, sources continue to highlight the view inside the administration that the plaintiffs lack standing to bring the challenges -- which would render the arguments over the authority itself moot. one source familiar told cnn that the white house remains confident that things will go their way, simply saying: ""we'll win."" a particular flashpoint in the hearing was the states' arguments that the loan forgiveness program's potential harms to mohela -- the missouri-created entity that services loans in the state -- gives missouri standing. justice amy coney barrett stood out among the conservatives for asking particularly pointed questions of the gop states about their standing arguments, setting her apart as a potential pickup vote for the court's three liberal members. ""if mohela is an arm of the state, why didn't you just strong-arm mohela and say you've got to pursue this suit,"" barrett asked nebraska solicitor general james campbell. the question was one of several directed at campbell, who represented the group of republican-led states that argue the administration exceeded its authority, about the states' standing claims. another source familiar said that barrett's comments only raised optimism within the administration. but as several conservative justices leveled sharp questions related the government's authority on the matter, cardona's update appeared intended to assuage overarching concerns. it also previewed a political contrast officials will likely elevate should supreme court strike down biden's actions -- one white house officials have repeatedly pressed as the challenges have made their way through the courts. ""while opponents of this program would deny relief to tens of millions of working- and middle-class americans, we are fighting to deliver relief to borrowers who need support as they get back on their feet after the economic crisis caused by the pandemic,"" cardona wrote. biden's plan would cancel as much as $10,000 in federal student loan debt for people earning less than $125,000 a year, or less than $250,000 for married couples. individuals on pell grants could see up to $20,000 forgiven. in all, more than 40 million federal borrowers would qualify for some level of debt cancelation, with roughly 20 million who would have their balance forgiven entirely. the biden administration received 26 million applications for the program, which has been frozen as the court battles have played out, and more than 16 million applications had already been approved. cardona reiterated that a pause on federal loan payments, which was implemented during the trump administration in response to the pandemic and was set to restart at the same time cancellation was implemented, remain on hold as the supreme court deliberations play out. ""while we await the supreme court's decision, the pause on student loan payments remains in effect,"" cardona wrote. ""payments will resume 60 days after the supreme court announces its decision."" if the litigation is not resolved by june 30, payments are scheduled to resume 60 days after that date. if it has not made a decision or resolved the litigation by june 30, payments will resume 60 days after that. the supreme court's decision is expected to come this summer.",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.1141740083694458,0.828106164932251,0.057719748467206955,-0.13550680903890489,0,0,0,0,-0.13550680903890489,3.6593080478589197,41.0,0.08925141580143707
Supreme Court considers fate of Biden's student loan relief plan,2023-02-24,31.0,"thesupreme court heardoral arguments tuesday in two challengesto president joe biden’s student debt relief plan, with several conservative justices appearing skeptical of the government’s authority to discharge millions of dollars in federally held loans. if the conservatives do ultimately rule in favor of the policy’s challengers, the hearing made clear they will have to grapple with the legal questions around why states and individual borrowers should be allowed to sue over the program – questions that emerged as a flash point during the arguments. millions of qualifying student loan borrowerscould see up to $20,000 of their debt canceleddepending on the outcome of the arguments. how and when the justices rule will also determine when payments on federal student loans will resume after a pandemic-related pause was put in place nearly three years ago. inbiden v. nebraska,a group of republican-led states argued the administration exceeded its authority by using the pandemic as a pretext to mask the true goal of fulfilling a campaign promise to erase student-loan debt. the second case is department of education v. brown, which was initially brought by two individuals who did not qualify for the program and argue the government failed to follow proper rulemaking process when putting it in place. here are some takeaways from the oral arguments: conservatives see this case as another chance to rein in aggressive actions by biden: in the questions the conservative justices posed, they signaled that they see the gop states’ case as presenting the court withanother chance to draw the linesaround when the executive branch can and cannot act without congress. several of the exchanges concerned the application of the so-called“major questions doctrine,”a legal theory embraced by the court’s republican appointees that says congress can be expected to speak with specificity when it gives an agency power to do something of great political or economic significance. the states are arguing that under the doctrine, the biden student debt program should be blocked. chief justice john roberts said to us solicitor general elizabeth prelogar that the case “presents extraordinarily serious important issues about the role of congress.” justice brett kavanaugh asked prelogar to compare the dispute to cases in the court’s history where the court ultimately pushed back against government claims that a national emergency justified the aggressive, unilateral action by the executive branch. and justice neil gorsuch asked nebraska solicitor general james campbell, who is representing the red states, a series a questions that seemed aimed at helping the court further flesh out the doctrine. lawyer for gop state gets grilled on standing: whether the gop states are threatened by the type of harm that makes it appropriate for a court to intervene was a major theme. nebraska solicitor general james campbell received a series of questions – from justices on both sides of the ideological spectrum – about whether the states had overcome this procedural threshold, which is known as “standing.” a particular flashpoint in the hearing was the states’ arguments that the loan forgiveness program’s potential harms to mohela – the missouri-created entity that services loans in the state – gives missouri standing. several justices noted that mohela could have filed its own lawsuit challenging the program, but has not. barrett may be a justice to watch: justice amy coney barretthas stood out among the conservatives for asking particularly pointed questions of the gop states about their standing arguments, setting her apart as a potential pick up vote for the court’s three liberal members. “if mohela is an arm of the state, why didn’t you just strong-arm mohela and say you’ve got to pursue this suit,” barrett asked campbell, among several questions she asked him about the states’ standing claims. even if barrett swings to the liberals to vote that the lawsuit should be rejected because of the standing concerns, the biden administration will need the vote of one more gop-appointed justice. sotomayor raises the practical stakes of the case: in extended remarks to campbell, justice sonia sotomayor laid out the practical implications of the case in stark terms. “there’s 50 million students who are – who will benefit from this. who today will struggle. many of them don’t have assets sufficient to bail them out after the pandemic. they don’t have friends or families or others who can help them make these payments,” she remarked. those debtors will suffer in ways others won’t because of the pandemic, she said. “and what you’re saying is now we’re going to give judges the right to decide how much aid to give them instead of the person with the expertise and the experience the secretary of education who’s been dealing with educational issues and the problems surrounding student loans,” she said. read more takeaways here. ##catch up## president joe biden’s plan to forgive up to $20,000 of student loans for some people is on pause as challenges make their way through the court system —but experts say there is a college affordability problem that needs to be addressed. mamie voight, the president and ceo of the institute for higher education policy, said states have an important role in accomplishing this. states need to invest “really heavily in their public institutions to keep those tuition costs low for students” and minimize the need to borrow. one example, she said, is states' ability to direct grant aid and help students, particularly from low-income backgrounds, cover both the cost of tuition and the cost of living. when students are deciding where to go to college and how to pay for it, the idea is that “they’re able to piece together investments from the federal government through the pell grant, hopefully relatively low tuition costs because of state investment in public higher education and grants and scholarships from the institutions that are directed to students who really couldn't afford to go to college without that financial support,” voight said. if the affordability issue isn't solved, higher education and the opportunity for economic mobility, won’t be attainable for many people, voight said. “it’s really incumbent upon policy maker at the federal, state and institution level to really address these challenges” both in the short-term and the long-term, she said, stressing that idea of a shared partnership. elizabeth shermer, a historian and associate professor at loyola university chicago, said she agrees with the importance of state involvement. “it always comes from the local and state up to the federal, that's how it’s always worked,” she said. the way forward, in her opinion, is legislation that connects states and the federal government together on the issue by creating high-quality, tuition-free options for students to put pressure on four-year institutions to lower their tuition prices. she said she supports the proposed college for all act, introduced by sen. bernie sanders and rep. pramila jayapal, that would do this. alternatively, offering two free years of community college would also accomplish that same competition she believes is necessary for long-term change. the supreme court finished hearing oral arguments in two cases challenging president joe biden's student loan forgiveness program. what may happen next: under normal circumstances, a case with such high political stakes would likely be resolved in late june or early july. but because the justices expedited the briefing, there is a possibility they may prioritize the opinion and release it before the end of the term. if the supreme court rules that thebiden administration’s student loan forgiveness program is legal and allows it to move forward — or if the court dismisses the challenges due to a lack of “standing,” or the legal right to bring the disputes in the first place — it’s possible the government willbegin issuing some debt cancellations fairly quickly. if the court strikes down the program, it could be possible for the administration to make some modifications to the policy and try again – though that process could take months. us solicitor general elizabeth prelogar is now at the podium again to deliver her rebuttal and closing arguments. during today's hearing, prelogar has argued that the administration has the clear legal authority to provide relief to borrowers in order to protect them from the financial harms brought on by the pandemic, such as the inability to buy food or make rent or mortgage payments. she stressed that the higher education relief opportunities for students act of 2003 —known as the heroes act— provides the legal authority for the relief. she will also say that the states do not have the sufficient injury necessary to bring the claim in the first place. prelogar told the supreme court that it should not be thinking about the political debate over student debt that predated the pandemic when the justices consider whether biden's forgiveness program is lawful. ##arguments## the court's liberals pushed back on how conservative justices had focused on whether the biden student debt relief program was fair to all borrowers. the issue is key to the case the court is hearing now, because the challengers -- two borrowers -- claim they were unlawfully deprived of a notice-and-comment period to argue to the agency that the program wasn't fair to them. ""i think the bottom-line answer to be, everybody suffered in the pandemic. but different people got different benefits because they qualified under different programs, correct?"" justice sonia sotomayor noted to us solicitor general elizabeth prelogar. sotomayor: there is an ""inherent unfairness in society because we're not a society of unlimited resources."" justice ketanji brown jackson echoed that point, telling prelogar, ""i'm wondering whether or not the same fairness issue would arise with respect to any federal benefit programs."" attorney j. michael connollyis now taking the podium on behalf of two student borrowers —myra brown and alexander taylor. connolly works for the boutique law firm consovoy mccarthy, which also represented former president donald trump in some of his legal battles. connollyis likely to repeat what he said in briefs, that the heroes act “does not authorize the secretary to cancel nearly half-a-trillion dollars in debts held by tens of millions of individuals."" this case may not go as long as the first because so many of the issues are the same. prelogar is then expected return to end the marathon session. what happens next:under normal circumstances, a case with such high political stakes would likely be resolved in late june or early july. but because the justices expedited the briefing, there is a possibility they may prioritize the opinion and release it before the end of the term. us solicitor general elizabeth prelogar told the supreme court that it should not be thinking about the political debate over student debt that predated the pandemic when the justices consider whether biden's forgiveness program is lawful. she was responding to a question from justice brett kavanaugh. he noted that student debt relief was ""something on the table,"" that was being ""discussed' and ""debated"" before it became part of the government's response to the covid-19. prelogar discouraged the justices from taking those political dynamics into account in their ruling on the scope of the heroes act, the law that the biden administration says gives it the authority to enact the program. she told kavanaugh to put himself in the shoes of the 2003 congress hat passed that law. she argued that those lawmakers couldn't have anticipated whether or not debt relief was the subject of political debate when a national emergency in the form a pandemic hit. she said that if the court lets those political dynamics affect its ruling, it will have ""disabled"" congress' ability to pass laws to ensure that the executive branch can respond quickly to emergency. ##arguments## the conservative justices have peppered us solicitor generalelizabeth prelogar with questions about why president joe biden's proposed student loan forgiveness program is fair in respect to people who won't benefit — those who have already paid off their student debt or never took out student loans to begin with, for example. after justices, including chief justice john roberts, asked several times about the fairness of the program, justice samuel alito posed the question again. ""why was it fair to the people who didn't get arguably comparable relief, not maybe that their interests were outweighed by the interests of those who were benefited or they were somehow less deserving of solicitude,"" alito asked. ""my answer to that question is that congress has already made the judgment that when there is a national emergency that affects borrowers in this way, the secretary can provide relief,"" prelogar said. she pointed to language in the heroes act that says the education secretary can waive or modify federal student loan programs to ensure that borrowers ""are not placed in a worse position financially in relation to that financial assistance."" ##arguments## us solicitor general elizabeth prelogar argued that the two plaintiffs – student loan borrowers myra brown and alexander taylor — don't have the legal right, or ""standing,"" to bring the case. under president joe biden's proposed student loan forgiveness program, neither plaintiff would qualify for the maximum amount of debt relief. brown doesn't qualify at all because her loans are privately held and taylor is only eligible for up to $10,000 of debt relief — not up to $20,000 — because he did not receive a pell grant while enrolled in college. ""they claim to want greater loan forgiveness than the plan provides. but they asked this court to hold that the heroes act doesn't authorize loan forgiveness at all,"" prelogar said. if the biden program is struck down, not only would the plaintiffs get no relief at all, but no one else would either. ""parties cannot go to court to make themselves and everyone else worse off,"" prelogar said. ##arguments## the key legal question in the cases before the supreme court on tuesday is whether the higher education relief opportunities for students act of 2003, known as the heroes act, grants the executive branch an emergency power to implement president joe biden’s student loan forgiveness program. the heroes act, which was passed in the wake of the september 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, grants the secretary of education the power to “waiveor modify” a federal student loan program in order to ensure that individuals “are not placed in a worse position financially” because of “a war or other military operation or national emergency.” lawyers for the biden administrationarguethat this provision gives the secretary of education the authority to cancel federal student loan debt so that borrowers are not made worse off with respect to their loans by the effects of the covid-19 pandemic. they cite data that shows borrowers who previously had their payments paused due to an emergency like a hurricane were at a higher risk of default after the pause expired. but plaintiffs argue the biden administration is abusing its power and using the pandemic as a pretext for fulfilling the president’s campaign pledge to cancel student debt. even before ruling on the merits of the cases, the justices must consider whether the suing parties have standing to bring the legal challenges. this means that the parties must show that they have the legal injury necessary to be able to bring the challenge. last year, a district court found that the states did not have standing to sue. the states appealed to the 8th us circuit court of appeals, which granted their request for a preliminary injunction. if the justices decide that none of the parties have standing, the cases will be dismissed and biden’s program will be allowed to move forward. the supreme court has now moved on to hear arguments in the second case challenging president joe biden's student loan forgiveness program. it just finished hearing arguments from a case brought by six states. the second case was initially brought by two student borrowers. us solicitor general elizabeth prelogar is back at the podium. she is expected to say that the students – myra brown and alexander taylor — like the states, don’t have the legal right to bring the case. she is likely to emphasize that the borrowers didn’t qualify for full relief in the first place, so they won’t be injured if the plan goes into effect. justice brett kavanaugh sought some context on how the court should see the current dispute over student debt relief fitting within the larger spectrum of other cases dealing with executive branch actions aimed at the covid-19 pandemic. kavanaugh referenced the court rulings that blocked biden's eviction moratorium and the covid-19 vaccine mandate requirement for certain businesses. but he also noted the biden administration vaccine mandate for some health care facilities. kavanaugh told nebraska solicitor generaljames a. campbell that one of the key distinctions in the health care vaccine mandate cases is that the policy was in the ""wheelhouse"" of the cdc, the agency that implemented it. he asked the nebraska solicitor general to weigh in on the argument by the doj and others that loan forgiveness is also in the ""wheelhouse"" of the education department, distinguishing it from the cases where the court ruled against biden covid-19 policies. campbell said that the loan forgiveness policy was not in the education department's wheelhouse because it required the secretary to make a brand new cancellation program. ##arguments## us solicitor general elizabeth prelogar is now offering a rebuttal in the first case challenging the biden administration's plan to forgive student loans. nebraska's solicitor general james a. campbell was just at the podium arguing on behalf of the six republican-led states that say they would be harmed financially if the forgiveness program goes into effect. prelogar has been arguing that the department of education has the authority to implement debt cancellation. after this, the court is expected to hear arguments in the second case brought by two borrowers who don’t fully qualify for debt forgiveness under the program. the justices have spent a considerable amount of time on tuesday quizzing an attorney for the red states on why a student loan servicer created by missouri didn’t bring the lawsuit before the court. “usually, we don't allow one person to step into another's shoes and say, ‘i think that that person suffered harm,’ even if the harm is very great,” justice elena kagan said to nebraska solicitor generaljames a. campbell. “so why isn't mohela responsible for deciding whether to bring this suit?” justice amy coney barrett piled on later, asking campbell: “if mohela is an arm of the state, why didn't you just strong-arm mohela and say you've got to pursue this suit?” the questions dig at the core of the biden administration’s argument: that the states lack the legal right known as “standing” to challenge the debt relief program and that instead, the missouri higher education loan authority (mohela) should have sued, since the servicer would have easily cleared the standing threshold. a federal appeals court previously focused on one of the states behind the challenge, missouri, and pointed to mohela, which has contracted with the federal department of education to service student loans. the court said that because mohela will stop receiving servicing fees for loans discharged under the new plan, it won’t be able to fulfill its obligation to contribute a specified amount of money to the state treasury. theappeals court ruledmohela is akin to a state entity and therefore said that it satisfied the standing requirement. critics of that theory say that mohela was established with financial and legal independence from the state of missouri and the vast amount of its funds are segregated from state funds. they believe that for the purpose of the lawsuit, mohela cannot be considered an “arm of the state.” white house officials on tuesday are closely monitoring oral arguments that are getting underway before the supreme court, keenly aware that what happens today inside the nation’s highest court will determine the fate of a major policy priority for president joe biden – canceling student loan debt. the white house has expressed confidence it will prevail. one of the main reasons comes down to standing, the source said, arguing that the burden is currently on the six republican-led states and two borrowers in texas — who have brought two cases against the administration — to prove that they have the legal authority to challenge the proposed program. last year, a district court found that the states did not have standing to sue. biden announced last year a federal student loan forgiveness program that would forgive up to $20,000 in debt for some borrowers. the legal challenges have left many borrowers stuck in limbo. the supreme court’s decision on the matter is not expected until this summer. justice elena kagan expressed skepticism about the states' argument that the heroes act doesn't clearly give the education secretary the authority to cancel federal student debt in the case of an emergency. ""congress used its voice,"" kagan said.""all this business about executive power, i mean, we worry about executive power when congress hasn't authorized the use of executive power. here, congress has authorized the use of executive power in an emergency situation,"" she added. kagan stressed that she believes that congress made the statute very clear in this respect. ""congress doesn't get much clearer than that. and we deal with congressional statutes every day that are really confusing. this one is not,"" she added. as the nine justices hear oral arguments inside the supreme court, cnn spoke to people outside the building rallying for president joe biden's plan for student loan debt forgiveness . here's what some of them said: destiny perry, a first-generation college student at morgan state university in baltimore, lives in a single-parent household of five. “right now, i have taken out a lot of loans. ... i'm out here trying to just go through college without having to stress about all the payments and everything else,” perry said. perry said she explores scholarship opportunities to offset the debt, but she knows it will not be enough to graduate debt-free. glen lopez, a freshman at morgan state, described his student debt as a ""creeping feeling."" he said that he thinks about the debt ""every two to three days."" rep. ayanna pressley told cnn she knows about student debt from a personal perspective. ""well, what i was sharing is a story that is certainly no anomaly. this is a systemic crisis – a nearly $2 trillion crisis burning people from every walk of life,” the massachusetts democrat said. “like those millions of black borrowers – and i was growing up in single-parent household — and given financial strain, i had no choice but to take out those loans. i ultimately defaulted on those loans and i did pay off those loans, but it took me 20 plus years to do so. and i was gainfully employed and often living check to check and i simply could just not make ends meet. i just could not get ahead,” she said. in response to opponents’ arguments that people should pay the loans they take out, pressley said that “hardship is not a character flaw."" ""and despite people's herculean efforts working multiple jobs, given rising costs, people are treading water. they're treading water, and we can do something to alleviate this burden and this hardship,” she said. natalia abrams, president and founder of the student debt crisis center, said she did not imagine the movement for student debt forgiveness getting this far. “over a decade ago, when we started this organization, we were lucky to just have senator [elizabeth] warren fighting for us. we had one senator and were so happy. i never would have imagined 10 years later we’d be on the steps of the supreme court and having the president of the united states fight for student loan borrowers,” she told cnn. ##reactions## nebraska solicitor general james campbell, who is representing all the gop states suing over the debt relief program, received tough questions from several justices about whether the states have really proved that they would be harmed by the loan forgiveness program in a way that would warrant a court intervention. that line of questions included a grilling from justice amy coney barrett, who zeroed in on how mohela — the missouri-created entity that services loans in the state and which missouri is pointed to as giving it standing — could have opted to challenge in court the debt relief policy but hasn't. ""if mohela is an arm of the state, why didn't you just strong-arm mohela and say you've got to pursue this suit,"" barrett asked campbell. he said that was a matter of state politics and justice elena kagan jumped in to note that even to get records from mohela, missouri has to use a state open records law. before barrett's inquiries, justice ketanji brown jackson also pressed campbell on whether the supposed harms the loan forgiveness program was causing mohela really established standing for missouri, as did kagan, who highlighted mohela's absence from the lawsuit. ##arguments## a case concerning a moratorium that had been placed on evictions during the covid-19 pandemic keeps coming up in tuesday's student debt relief policy arguments. us solicitor general elizabeth prelogar tried to draw a distinction between the two cases while answering a series of questions from justice brett kavanaugh. she said the centers for disease control and prevention eviction case brought up concerns of an agency acting ""outside the core of its domain,"" but that is not what is happening with the department of education. ""this is the student loan program. that falls within the wheelhouse of the secretary of education. he exercises comprehensive authority over that program. these are federal loans between the federal government and student loan borrowers, so this is a situation where the secretary is really acting within the core of his expertise and his authority,"" prelogar said. those challenging the student debt forgiveness say there are parallels between the two cases, while the biden administration argues the disputes are distinct. the eviction moratorium case did not even get a full hearing before the supreme court. what has been cited by president joe biden’s foes is a per curium order — an unsigned order from the supreme court that blocked the cdc policy that tenants could not get evicted while the moratorium was in place. the case was seen as a forerunner to the supreme court’s full-scale endorsement — in a case handed down in june — of the so-called major questions doctrine, which says that if congress is going to give the agency the power to make policy on a matter of significant political or economic consequence, lawmakers can be expected to say so with specificity in the laws that they pass. “if a federally imposed eviction moratorium is to continue, congress must specifically authorize it,” the court said in the august 2021 order. the liberals on the court at the time dissented. opponents of the student debt program say that tuesday’s case arises in similar circumstances as the eviction moratorium dispute: an executive branch agency allegedly using the pandemic as a pretext to go beyond the authority that congress has given it to enact a major policy change. justice ketanji brown jackson gave us solicitor general elizabeth prelogar the opportunity to stress how a ruling that said the states had standing in this case could hamper the federal government's ability to operate. ""i guess i'm concerned that we're going to have a problem in terms of the federal government's ability to operate,"" the justice said. ""so my question is, is this a legitimate concern and should we be thinking in cases like this, about that type of concern as we ponder whether to expand our standing doctrines?"" prelogar agreed that it was a ""legitimate concern."" she noted that past things the court has said about standing and how ""the judiciary doesn't sit as a roving commission to rule on the legality of either congress's enactments or the executive's implementation of those enactments."" ##arguments## justice brett kavanaugh, in comments to us solicitor general elizabeth prelogar, suggested he saw the student debt case existing in a history of the court deciding whether it would defer to an executive branch claim that a national emergency warranted aggressive unilateral action. the biden administration is arguing that the national emergency presented by the covid-19 pandemic — and the economic disruption the pandemic wrought — justified the education secretary canceling the student loans of certain debtors. ""some of the biggest mistakes in the court's history were deferring to assertions of executive or emergency power,"" kavanaugh said. ""some of the finest moments in the court's history were pushing back against presidential assertions of emergency power, and that's continued not just in the korean war, but post-9/11, in some of the cases there."" he asked prelogar to explain to the court ""how we should think about our role in assertion of presidential emergency power, given the court's history."" prelogar returned to a theme that she has brought up repeatedly in tuesday's arguments: that there is distinction between an executive action that regulates people's conduct versus an action that deals with the doling out of government benefits. ##arguments## justice clarence thomas questioned us solicitor general elizabeth prelogar about the distinction between the biden administration's student loan debt forgiveness program and grants that congress needs to appropriate. ""there's some discussion in the briefs .... that this is in effect a cancellation of a debt, that's really what we're talking about, and that as a cancellation of $400 billion in debt, in effect this is a grant of $400 billion and it runs headlong into congress' appropriations authority,"" thomas said. prelogar said that implementing the debt relief program doesn't require that any money be drawn from the treasury, so it doesn't strictly raise an appropriations issue. she also said while loan forgiveness would ""of course"" result in cancellation of a measure of debt for borrowers, she doesn't ""think that that is materially different from the kind of effects you can see from other types of authority that's long been exercised under the heroes act."" thomas said he didn't think she fully explained why you could not argue that the education secretary could just grant $400 billion — which would require appropriations from congress. ""the argument is that you are in effect doing that without appropriations from congress,"" thomas said. prelogar gave an example of relief in periods of extended deferment for soldiers fighting abroad, in which the government has paid interest on loans. ""that's exactly what congress intended under this authority; it's to make those changes to the program in direct response to and in direct proportion to the situation the secretary confronts that will otherwise leave that borrower worse off,"" she said. ##arguments## nebraska’s solicitor general james a. campbell is now speaking at the podium before the nine justices after us solicitor general elizabeth prelogar wrapped her arguments on behalf of the biden administration. campbell is representing the six states that say they would be harmed financially if president joe biden's student loan forgiveness program goes into effect. he is expected to offer several theories to explain why the states will be injured by the plan. most of his theories revolve around the potential of lost tax revenue. he's also expected to stress that the plan amounts to an unlawful attempt to erase an estimated $430 billion of federal student loan debt under the guise of the pandemic. chief justice john roberts made clear that he saw the student debt forgiveness as an important opportunity for the court to further flesh out its ""major questions doctrine."" ""we take very seriously the idea of separation of powers and that power should be divided to prevent its abuse,"" roberts told us solicitor general elizabeth prelogar. he said that the case reminded him of a decision from the trump administration where the court blocked trump's efforts to end the ""dreamers"" program for young undocumented immigrants brought to the united states as minors. ""ijust wonder, given the posture of the case and given our historic concern about the separation of powers, you would recognize at least that this is a case that presents extraordinarily serious important issues about the role of congress and about the role that we should exercise in scrutinizing that, significant enough that the major questions doctrine ought to be considered implicated?"" roberts said. remember: under the “major questions doctrine,"" if an agency acts in a way that could have major political or economic implications, it must have the authority of congress. the states are saying here that essentially, the college debt relief plan is too big for the biden administration to use the authority in its citing. ##arguments## justice neil gorsuch asked whether the biden administration considered the cost to people who are not eligible for the proposed student loan forgiveness program because they don't have student loans. the plaintiffs said that missing from the government's analysis, gorsuch said, is the ""cost to other persons in terms of fairness, for example, people who've paid their loans... and people who are not eligible for loans in the first place."" more context: americans who did not go to college or already paid off their student loans won’t see a direct benefit from biden’s program, which the congressional budget office has estimated will cost $400 billion over time. also, a one-time cancellation of federal student loan debt does nothing to bring down the cost of college for future borrowers. about 81%of households who earn less than $125,000 a year don’t have student loan debt, according to an analysis done last year by matthew chingos, vice president of education data and policy at the urban institute. he based the estimation on the 2019 survey of consumer finances conducted by the federal reserve. ##arguments## justice neil gorsuch brought up the court's decision in 2019 that blocked former president donald trump's plans to add a citizenship question to the census. chief justice john roberts joined the court's then-four liberals to rule in favor of the question's challengers and that ruling is one of the cases that the opponents to student debt relief are citing to back their standing arguments. gorsuch noted tuesday that the court said in the census case, that the potential undercount of the citizenship question would cause new york established standing for new york to bring that case, because an undercount would have cost new york federal funding and a loss in other benefits. ""that kind of knock-on effect was sufficient to constitute standing in that case, and i just like to get your thoughts on how you'd have us distinguish that?"" gorsuch asked. prelogar said that in the census case the injury that would have been caused by an undercount was more direct, and that in the student debt case, the financial injuries the states were claiming were ""self inflicted."" related: exclusive: how john roberts killed the census citizenship question the so-called ""major questions doctrine"" is already seeing a lot of attention as the red states’ case is debated before the justices on tuesday. but what exactly is it? last term, the court cited the “major questions doctrine” in a 6-3 decision that curbed the environmental protection agency’s ability to broadly regulate carbon emissions from existing power plants. under the theory, if an agency acts in a way that could have major political or economic implications, it must have the authority of congress. the states are saying here that essentially, the college debt relief plan is too big for the biden administration to use the authority in its citing. it's an argument that will appeal to the court's conservatives and their 6-3 majority over the liberals. justice samuel alito, for instance, brought it up. “is this the sort of thing that congress is likely to address expressly or through a contestable interpretation of some statutory language?” alito asked us solicitor general elizabeth prelogar. “well, of course, we think congress did address this expressly here. and congress directed that in the context of a national emergency – that is the limitation of the heroes act.” prelogar replied. “the (education) secretary acted within the heartland of his authority and in line with the central purpose of the heroes act in providing that relief here. to apply the major questions doctrine to override that clear text will deny borrowers critical relief that congress authorized and the secretary deemed essential,” prelogar said. chief justice john roberts drew attention to the fact that the biden administration wants to use a power to ""modify"" federal student loan programs in order to cancel roughly $400 billion in debt. ""in an opinion we had a few years ago by justice (antonin) scalia, he talked about what the word 'modify' means, and he said 'modified' in our view connotes moderate change,"" roberts said. ""it might be good english to say that the french revolution modified the status of the french nobility, but only because there's a figure of speech called understatement and a literary device known as sarcasm,"" roberts said. ""we're talking about half a trillion dollars and 43 million americans. how does that fit under the normal understanding of modified?"" roberts asked. the biden administration argues it has the power to cancel federal student loan debt under a 2003 law called the hereos act. but the law does not explicitly say the secretary of education has the power to cancel or forgive student loan debt. instead, the law says the secretary of education has the power to “waiveor modify” a federal student loan program in order to ensure that individuals “are not placed in a worse position financially” because of “a war or other military operation or national emergency.” us solicitor general elizabeth prelogar argued that in the context of the statute, ""modify has to mean making a change up to the point of wholesale elimination."" ""it would be really strange for congress to say you can eliminate obligations altogether or tweak them just the littlest bit. but you can't do anything in between,"" she said. ##arguments## it did not take long for the issue of so-called ""standing"" to come up in tuesday's arguments on the student loan relief program. what does this mean? ""standing"" refers to the harm a plaintiff must show they are facing in order for a court to intervene. the biden administration argues that the challengers in the student debt forgiveness case have not overcome this procedural threshold, meaning that the supreme court could reject their case without even getting into the legal merits of the relief program. justice samuel alito dug in on the issue in questions to us solicitor general elizabeth prelogar and signaled that he was sympathetic to the argument that the states suing the administration had established standing. he pointed specifically to missouri's claim that that the revenue shortfalls the biden action could cause the missouri higher education loan authority (mohela) — an entity that was created by the state to service student loans — could cause knock-on financial harms to missouri itself. ""why shouldn't the test be something more like whether the relationship between this entity and the state of missouri is such that an injury to mohela will necessarily or presumptive be an injury to the state,"" alito said. justice ketanji brown jackson ultimately jumped in, to back up an argument prelogar was making: that the financial interests of missouri and mohela were not sufficiently entangled to give missouri standing. ##arguments## justice clarence thomas kicked off the oral arguments with the first round of questions, asking us solicitor general elizabeth prelogar how the mass loan forgiveness amounts to the terminology used in the relevant statute. ""would you take a minute to explain how a waiver or modification amounts to a ...cancellation,"" thomas said. the biden administration's foes in the case say that the terms ""waive"" or ""modify"" in the law giving the education secretary certain powers applies to smaller bore actions to adjust repayment plants, rather than a blank cancellation of classes of debt. prelogar told thomas that the law in question, the heroes act, contemplates many forms of action an education secretary could take in the face of a national emergency. congress was trying to “cover the field” to give the secretary tools to respond to a national emergency, she said. ##arguments## thesupreme courtis now hearing oral arguments on two challenges to president joe biden’sstudent loan forgiveness program– an initiative aimed at providing targeted debt relief to millions of student-loan borrowers – that has so far been stalled by legal challenges. republican-led states and conservatives challenging the program say it amounts to an unlawful attempt to erase an estimated $430 billion of federal student loan debt under the guise of the pandemic. at the heart of the case is the department of education’s authority to forgive the loans. several of the conservative justices have signaled in recent years that agencies – with no direct accountability to the public – have become too powerful, upsetting the separation of powers. they have moved to cut back on the so-called administrative state. tuesday’s caseswill also highlight an important threshold question that could block the court from reaching the merits of the dispute: whether the parties behind the challenge have the legal right, or “standing,” necessary to bring suit. what both sides are arguing: the biden administration argues that the secretary of education had the clear authority to provide the relief to borrowers making less than $125,000 per year ($250,000 for households) in 2020 or 2021 in order to protect them from financial harms brought on by the pandemic such as the inability to buy food or make rent or mortgage payments. as for the states, nebraska attorney general michael t. hilgers, who is also representing missouri, arkansas, iowa, kansas and south carolina, stressed that the biden administration exceeded its authority by using the pandemic as a pretext to mask the true goal of fulfilling a campaign promise to erase student-loan debt. desiree veney, a senior at morgan state university who qualified for potential loan forgiveness, said history is being made today. crowds of people are outside the us supreme court tuesday ahead of oral arguments in two cases that could decide the fate of president joe biden's student loan forgiveness program. ""it's a veryimportant day in history for not only meand also my peers,"" she told cnn. veney, who is also the vice president of her college's naacp chapter, is from harrisburg, pennsylvania, but attends school in maryland. this means she pays a lot more than some other students for out-of-state tuition, something she said will leave her at a disadvantage when she graduates. student debt has also prevented students at historically black colleges and universities specifically from being able to invest or purchase homes, veney said, expanding the racial wealth gap. debt forgiveness would be an ""opportunity to create a strongerand a more stable foundation formy family and to create generationalwealth afterward,"" she said, adding that it would give her more financial security after graduation and help further continue her education. ""if given this opportunity,it would be a blessing, yes, but it iskind of like you pray for thebest, but prepare for the worst,"" veney said. the supreme court oral arguments on president joe biden's student loan forgiveness program will kick off soon. first up at the podium before the nine justices will be us solicitor general elizabeth prelogar. she is expected to argue that the administration had the clear legal authority to provide relief to borrowers in order to protect them from the financial harms brought on by the pandemic, such as the inability to buy food or make rent or mortgage payments. she will stress that the higher education relief opportunities for students act of 2003—known as the heroes act—provides the legal authority for the relief. she will also say that the states do not have the sufficient injury necessary to bring the claim in the first place. next up will be nebraska’s solicitor general james a. campbell – representing the six states involved — who will offer several theories to explain why the states will be injured if the plan is allowed to go into effect. most of his theories revolve around the potential of lost tax revenue. he's also expected to stress that the plan amounts to an unlawful attempt to erase an estimated $430 billion of federal student loan debt under the guise of the pandemic. once campbell wraps up, prelogar will likely return to make a few closing arguments. the case is slated to last an hour, but look for it to go at least two hours. next comes the second case: with no break, the justices will then tackle the second case initially brought by two student borrowers. prelogar will appear again and is expected to say that the students – myra brown and alexander taylor — like the states, don’t have the legal right to bring the case. she is likely to emphasize that the borrowers didn’t qualify for full relief in the first place, so they won’t be injured if the plan goes into effect. j. michael connolly will then step up on behalf of brown and taylor. connolly works for the boutique law firm consovoy mccarthy, which also represented former president donald trump in some of his legal battles. the attorney is likely to repeat what he said in briefs. the heroes act “does not authorize the secretary to cancel nearly half-a-trillion dollars in debts held by tens of millions of individuals."" this case may not go as long as the first because so many of the issues are the same. prelogar will then return to end the marathon session. what happens next: under normal circumstances, a case with such high political stakes would likely be resolved in late june or early july. but because the justices expedited the briefing, there is a possibility they may prioritize the opinion and release it before the end of the term. the supreme court on tuesday will take up two challenges to president joe biden’s student loan forgiveness program. under the plan, approximately 40 million working and middle-class borrowers would receive up to $20,000 in relief, but republican-led states and conservatives challenged the program shortly after in was announced, saying it's an unlawful attempt to erase an estimated $430 billion of federal student loan debt under the guise of the pandemic advocates for student loan relief gathered outside the court ahead of the hearing on monday night and tuesday. see photos from the scene: about 26 million people had already applied for president joe biden's federal student loan forgiveness program when a federal district court judge struck down the plan in early november. no debt has been canceled thus far. the supreme court willhear arguments on tuesdayin two cases related to the program, with a decision expected by late june or early july. here's what to know about biden's challenged plan: who is eligible? if the courts ultimately allow the program to move forward, not every student loan borrower iseligible for the debt relief. first, only federally held student loans qualify. private student loans are excluded. second, high-income borrowers are generally excluded from receiving debt forgiveness. individual borrowers who make less than $125,000 a year and married couples or heads of households who make less than $250,000 annually could see up to $10,000 of their federal student loan debt forgiven. if aqualifying borroweralso received a federal pell grant while enrolled in college, the individual is eligible for up to $20,000 of debt forgiveness. what about current students? some current students would be eligible under biden’s plan if it’s allowed to take effect. eligibility for borrowers who filed the free application for federal student aid, known as the fafsa, as an independent will be based on the individual’s own household income. what kinds of loans qualify? there are a variety of federal student loans and not all are eligible for relief if the program is allowed to proceed. federal direct loans, including subsidized loans, unsubsidized loans, parent plus loans and graduate plus loans, are eligible. but federal student loans that are guaranteed by the government but held by private lenders are not eligible unless the borrower applied to consolidate those loans into a direct loan by september 29, 2022. will borrowers have to pay taxes on forgiven loans? borrowers will not have to pay federal income tax on the student loan debt forgiven, thanks to a provision in the american rescue plan act that congress passed in 2021. but it’s possible that some borrowers may have to pay state income tax on the amount of debt forgiven. there are a handful of states that may tax discharged debt if state legislative or administrative changes are not made beforehand, according tothe tax policy center.the tax liability could be hundreds of dollars, depending on the state. find answers to other questions about the program here. ##catch up## there are some who are surprised that the biden administration is coming to this conservative court and risking bad precedent. that’s because several of the justices have made clear in recent years that they believe federal agencies— that are unaccountable to the public —have become too powerful, upsetting the delicate separation of powers. in 2021, for instance,the court invalidated the biden administration’s covid-related eviction moratorium issued by the centers for disease control holding that such a program needs to be specifically authorized by congress. in 2022, the court blocked a nationwide vaccine or testing mandate for large businesses, sending a clear message that the occupational safety and health administration had overstepped its authority. and last term the court cited the so called “major questions doctrine” in a 6-3 decision that curbed the environmental protection agency’s ability to broadly regulate carbon emissions from existing power plants. under the theory, if an agency acts in a way that could have major political or economic implications, it must have the authority of congress. in one of today's cases, the red states invoke the major questions doctrine — urging the justices to rule against the biden administration’s student loan plan. look for the conservatives on the court to repeatedly press the government on whether it exceeded its authority in pushing through its student loan forgiveness plan. keep in mind that former president donald trump nominated justices neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh in part because they are often skeptical of government power. ##analysis## the us supreme court will soon hear oral arguments in two cases challenging president joe biden's student loan forgiveness program. the biden administration faced several lawsuits over the plan. the plaintiffs argue that the department of education is overstepping its authority. the plan would cancel up to $10,000 for some borrowers, and up to $20,000 to borrowers who received pell grants. last fall, the biden administrationbegan notifying peoplewho are approved for federal student loan relief. about 26 million people had already applied to the program by the time it was frozen prompting the government to stop taking applications. no debt has been canceled thus far. about the cases: one of the lawsuits was brought bysix republican-led states, headed by nebraska, that argue that the student loan forgiveness program violates the separation of powers and the administrative procedure act, a federal law that governs the process by which federal agencies issue regulations. they argue that it violates the separation of powers and that biden is using the pandemic as a pretext to mask his true goal of fulfilling a campaign promise to erase student loan debt. a lower court judge dismissed this lawsuit on october 20, ruling that the plaintiffs did not have the legal standing to bring the challenge. in november, the 8th us circuit court of appeals reversed and blocked the program. the other challenge that the supreme court will hear was brought by two individual borrowers – myra brown and alexander taylor – who are not qualified for full debt relief forgiveness and who say they were denied an opportunity to comment on the secretary of education’s decision to provided targeted student loan debt relief to some. the lawsuit was filed with the backing of a conservative group called the job creators network foundation. a federal judge in texas ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, striking down the program on november 10. lawyers for the government say that congress gave the secretary of education “expansive authority to alleviate the hardship that federal student loan recipients may suffer as a result of national emergencies,” like the covid-19 pandemic, according to amemofromthe department of justice. ##catch up## it’s been nearly three years since the us government decided to allowborrowers to pause paymentson student loans. since then, the debate on whether to forgive student loans hasreached the supreme court, which will hear the case later this month. whether you paid off a car loan, put down a payment on a new home or made a big purchase that had a significant impact on your life, cnn wants to know if those extra dollars helped you make any financial strides. we know the issue of student loans disproportionately affects those from low-income backgrounds and minority groups, and we’d like to hear from you. click here and share your stories with us, and we may follow up for a cnn story. president joe biden’sstudent loan forgiveness programis at the mercy of the supreme court, and student loan borrowers could be waiting weeks, if not months, to hear whether the program is allowed to go into effect. but there are several other ways many of the 43 million federal student loan borrowers may qualify for student debt relief. here's a look at some other programs: public service loan forgiveness: thepublic service loan forgiveness programallows certain government and nonprofit employees to seek federal student loan forgiveness after making 10 years of qualifying payments. a qualifying borrower’s full remaining balance is canceled, regardless of the amount. teachers, social workers, some nurses and doctors as well as government lawyers are some of the types of borrowers who may be eligible. teacher loan forgiveness program: theteacher loan forgiveness programcancels up to $17,500 in federal student loan debt for certain full-time teachers who have worked in a qualifying low-income elementary or secondary school for at least five consecutive years. math and science teachers who are considered to behighly qualifiedat the secondary school level, as well as special education teachers at both the elementary and secondary levels, are eligible for the full $17,500 of federal student loan forgiveness. those who are considered highly qualified and teach other subject areas may receive up to $5,000 in loan forgiveness. borrower defense to repayment: theborrower defense to repayment programdelivers student debt relief to people who were defrauded by their college. generally, students who attended big, for-profit colleges like corinthian colleges and itt tech that have been found to have misled students with inflated job-placement numbers will qualify for forgiveness under the federal program. there are some groups of students that the department of education has already determined are automatically eligible for borrower defense to repayment, but other students may have to apply for debt relief, demonstrating how the schools misled them or engaged in other misconduct. read about more of the programs here. if the supreme court strikes down president biden’s student loan forgiveness program, it could be possible for the administration to make some modifications to the policy and try again – though that process could take months. “the ball goes back to the biden administration,” said luke herrine, an assistant law professor at the university of alabama who previously worked on a legal strategy for student debt cancellation. “the administration could implement some other version of this installation under a different legal authority, but that may well generate its own litigation and we end up in the same place,” herrine added. the biden administration is also working on changes to existing federal student loan repayment plans that aim to make it easier for borrowers to pay for college. these changes are not facing legal challenges. the department of education is currently finalizing a new income-driven repayment plan to lower monthly payments as well as the total amount borrowers pay back over time. in contrast to the one-time student loan cancellation program, the new repayment plan could helpboth current and future borrowers. additionally, in july, changes will be made thepublic service loan forgiveness program, which allows certain government and nonprofit employees to seek federal student loan forgiveness after making 10 years of qualifying payments. the changes will make it easier for some borrowers to receive debt forgiveness. millions of americans have student loan debt,amassing to more than $1.6 trillionby the end of last year, according to the federal reserve bank of new york. the federal reserve data shows people under the age of 30 are more likely to have student loan debt compared with older adults — underscoring the crippling burden on another generation of americans. but the impact is multigenerational. nearly a quarter of the outstanding student loan debt is owed by americans who are 50 and older. student debt has not always been a crisis. the modern federal education borrowing system came from a series of legislative moves aimed at helping more people have access to college — but it came with some unintended consequences. here are some of the key moments: 1958: the first federal initiative the national student loan program, aimed at expanding access to higher education, was launched in 1958. created from the national defense education act, it was the first federal student loan initiative for those studying certain subjects to improve science, mathematics and engineering skills during the cold war. 1965: the higher education act the higher education act of 1965 opened the possibility of college to even more people, regardless of area of study — but it also created a new type of relationship between the federal government, banks and college campuses through the guaranteed student loan program. it solved for the government the challenge of how to get lenders involved with such a risky financial investment: the loan did not come from the federal government, but instead, the government assured repayment to bankers willing to give loans, shermer said. 1970: sallie mae and a boom in borrowing and private loans the student loan marketing association, known as sallie mae, was created through the reauthorization of the higher education act in 1972. sallie mae offered private student loans along with other financial products. the availability of financial aid products to both for-profit and nonprofit companies allowed for the rise of private student loans, she said. that coupled with therising cost of tuitionin the 1970s meant that students needed more money to continue their education. since there was a limit to how much students could borrow in federal loans, private loans were needed as a supplement. another reason why private loans became more critical was pressure in washington for congress to cut taxes and cut spending, she said. keep reading here. ##catch up## the supreme court is set to hear a headline-grabbing case concerning president joe biden’s student loan forgiveness program that will affect the finances of millions of americans. critics, including the republican-led states that have sued, say the initiative amounts to an unlawful attempt to erase an estimated$430 billionof federal student-loan debt under the guise of the pandemic. but the legal impact could go well beyond the fate of the program. the us supreme court will hear oral arguments in the state-led case plus another brought by individual borrowers backed by a conservative group on tuesday. while most of the attention so far is focused on whether the department of education exceeded its authority in implementing the program, some court watchers are focused on an equally important procedural issue that is a major part of the case: whether the red states behind the challenge have the legal right, or “standing” to bring the dispute in the first place. the concept of standing is one that requires a party to establish an actual or imminent injury to get into court. simply disagreeing with a policy is not enough. in recent years, states from one party have felt increasingly emboldened to come to court to sue an administration from a different party over a controversial policy. for the biden administration, the issue is of critical importance now, especially as republican-led states feel they have an advantage with the court’s 6-3 conservative majority. professor samuel bray of notre dame law school said it’s a problem for both democratic and republican administrations and he worries about states using the judicial branch to bring federal policymaking to a standstill. judges are meant to decide concrete disputes between parties, the thinking goes, and they should not engage in political or policy debates better left to the other branches of government. keep reading here. ahead of today's pivotal supreme court oral arguments, education secretary miguel cardona told cnn that the administration is assured in its authority to forgive $430 billion of federal student loan debt. ""we feel very confident in ourcase, in my authority under theheroes act, to provide reliefover 40 million people acrossthe country,"" cardona said on ""cnn this morning."" what is the heroes act?: in court papers, us solicitor general elizabeth prelogar stressed that the higher education relief opportunities for students act of 2003 – known as the heroes act – provides the government with the authority to offer the relief. under the law, passed to help active-duty military in the wake of the september 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the government says the secretary of education has the authority to act in a national emergency to make sure borrowers are not left worse off with respect to their loans than they were before the emergency. ""we're working on fixing brokensystems, but we feel confidentthat this plan is legal, based onthe fact that it's off of thepandemic and the economic impactthat the pandemic caused,"" cardona said. the secretary added that the covid-19 pandemic is a current ongoing crisis, despite biden saying the pandemic is ""over"" in an interview on ""60 minutes"" in september 2022. the administration plans to end the covid-19 national and public health emergencies in may. but cardona said the ""economicimpact of the pandemic is stillreal,"" adding that the majority of the student loan relief is targeted to those making under $75,000. the fate of president joe biden'sstudent loan forgivenessprogram that would impact scores of borrowers from a wide array of colleges and socioeconomic backgrounds lies in the hands of nine relatively wealthy people who graduated from a short list of elite private schools. when the biden administration goes before thesupreme courttuesday todefend the program,which would offer up to $20,000 of federal student debt forgiveness to millions of qualified borrowers, it will be making its arguments to a small group of jurists who are far from being representative of the borrowers that could benefit from the relief. the justices' salaries alone set them apart from most of the country: chief justice john roberts will make $298,500 in 2023, while each of the associate justices will bring in $274,200 this year for their service. that doesn't include any revenue from outside sources, like book deals. the court is also comprised of some of the nation's brightest legal minds from a small number of prestigious schools, yet another factor that underscores their distance from the borrowers who could benefit from the debt relief assistance. most of itscurrent membersattended one of two ivy league law schools: harvard and yale. roberts, along with justices ketanji brown jackson, neil gorsuch and elena kagan all attended harvard law school. justices sonia sotomayor, clarence thomas, samuel alito and brett kavanaugh went to yale law school. the only current justice who is not part of the ivy club is amy coney barrett, who received her law degree from notre dame. some of the justices had financial assistance to help them attend school: thomasreceived a scholarshipfrom holy cross college to pay for his undergraduate degree there, whilesotomayorattended princeton university and yale law school on scholarships. and they have come from different backgrounds with different politics. thomas, for instance, grew up in poverty in pin point, georgia, and is the court's leading conservative justice. keep reading here. ##analysis## the fate of president joe biden’s majorstudent loan forgiveness programlies with the supreme court. it could be as late as summer before the justices rule on whether the policy can take effect, leaving borrowers uncertain about the future of their loan payments. the mired rollout of biden’s forgiveness program hascreated confusionfor borrowers. here are some of the big questions still surrounding student loans: will biden's student loan forgiveness plan take effect? thesupreme court will hear argumentsin two cases concerning biden’s student loan forgiveness program on tuesday, which could deliver up to $20,000 of debt relief for millions of low- and middle-income borrowers. a decision on whether the program is legal and can move forward is expected by june. until then, it is on hold and no debt will be discharged under the program. litigants argue the biden administration has overstepped its authority, and other recent supreme court decisions haveruled against aggressive executive agency actions. however, lawyers for the biden administration say that congress gave the secretary of education “expansive authority to alleviate the hardship that federal student loan recipients may suffer as a result of national emergencies,” like the covid-19 pandemic, according to amemofrom the department of justice. when will the pandemic pause on payments end? for the third consecutive year, federal student loan borrowers started 2023 without having to make payments on their loans thanks to a pandemic-related pause. payments were set to resume in january, but thebiden administration extended the pauseafter its student loan forgiveness program was halted by federal courts. officials had told borrowers debt relief would be granted before payments restarted. the payment pause will now last until 60 days after litigation over biden’s student loan forgiveness program is resolved. if the program has not been implemented and the litigation has not been resolved by june 30, payments will resume 60 days after that. what about the new student loan repayment plan? the biden administration has proposedbig changes to existing income-driven repayment plans, aimed at making payments more manageable for borrowers. it’s unclear when the reforms may take effect. the changes, which could impact roughly 8 million people currently enrolled in income-driven repayment plans and open up the plans for more borrowers, would reduce monthly debt burdens, as well as the total amount borrowers, pay over the lifetime of their loans. the department of education expects to start implementing some parts of the new income-driven repayment plan later this year but needs to go through a rulemaking process first. dive deeper into looming questions here.",5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.4084904551506042,0.5547802656888962,0.03672930058091879,-0.50910777875506,0,0,0,0,-2.5455388937752996,3.792170234555014,41.0,0.0924919569403662
Fox faces an 'existential threat' from its multibillion-dollar defamation cases,2023-02-28,32.0,"fox chairman rupert murdoch said under oath that he made a business decision when allowing a conspiracy theorist to promote election lies on fox news. ""it is not red or blue; it is green,"" he told lawyers in a deposition made public monday. but spreading falsehoods about the 2020 presidential election for the money may prove extremely costly for fox. the network faces two separate defamation lawsuits from voting technology companies that collectively seek $4.3 billion in damages. fox corporation, the right-wing news outlet's owner, has an estimated $4 billion in cash on hand, according to its latest earnings statement. ""when damages get into the billions, with a b, that can be an existential threat to a journalistic organization — even one as lucrative as as fox,"" said lyrissa lidsky, a constitutional law professor at the university of florida. even if the damages are exaggerated, lidsky said, a verdict against fox in either case would be ""a terrible reputational black eye."" murdoch's bombshell deposition — in which he acknowledged that some fox hosts endorsed false claims that the 2020 election was stolen — could be a game-changer for dominion's case, which hinges on meeting a high legal bar known as ""actual malice."" to meet that standard, a plaintiff has to show that the defendant made defamatory statements with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard for the truth. ""this is one of the most devastating depositions that i've ever seen,"" cnn legal analyst norm eisen said monday. ""when you go beyond reporting and your chairman admits there was endorsement, then that opens you up to liability under the actual malice standard."" if fox were to lose either case, it's not guaranteed that it would have to pay the full amount if a jury decides the damages were excessive. on the other hand, eisen noted, a jury could also increase the award. ""if the jury decides that it was bad enough conduct, they can double or triple that $1.6 billion or go even higher,"" eisen told cnn's wolf blitzer. cases against fox dominion voting systems is suing fox news and fox corporation for $1.6 billion, accusing the network of spreading false claims that its technology enabled election fraud. a trial is set for april. a separate, similar case brought by voting technology firm smartmatic is seeking $2.7 billion in damages. media companies typically have insurance that would cover defamation payouts, though details of fox's coverage aren't known. defamation is notoriously difficult to prove in the united states, which grants news organizations and entertainment companies wide berth under the first amendment. fox has repeatedly stressed that airing the fraud claims was newsworthy and protected under the constitution. but dominion's case is unusually strong, legal experts say. ""the evidence that's been put into the public sphere so far looks like strong evidence that fox knew the truth and decided to go with an alternate narrative,"" lidsky says. legal filings from dominion have shown behind-the-scenes messages showing fox's stars — including tucker carlson, sean hannity, and laura ingraham — mock the lies being pushed by the former president trump's camp asserting that the election was rigged. it also illustrated instances of fox actively pushing back on fact-checks that undermined the election lies being peddled by supporters of former president donald trump. murdoch, meanwhile, conceded that sean hannity, jeanine pirro, maria bartiromo, and former host lou dobbs promoted falsehoods about the presidential contest being stolen. ""some of our commentators were endorsing it,,"" murdoch said, according to the filing, when asked about the hosts' on-air positions about the election. ""i would have liked us to be stronger in denouncing it, in hindsight,"" he added. the filing also revealed that murdoch referred to some of trump's 2020 election lies as ""bulls**t and damaging."" in a statement, fox pushed back against dominion's legal standing, saying the company's lawsuit ""has always been more about what will generate headlines than what can withstand legal and factual scrutiny."" —cnn's oliver darcy contributed to this article.",3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.8906873861948649,0.09314134965340297,0.016171308389554422,-0.9999952319679636,0,0,0,0,-2.9999856959038906,-3.2292824125155333,12.0,-0.2691068677096278
Top US Defense official says Iran could produce 'one bomb's worth of fissile material' in 'about 12 days',2023-02-28,33.0,"iran could now produce ""one bomb's worth of fissile material"" in ""about 12 days,"" a top us defense department official said tuesday. under secretary of defense for policy colin kahl offered one of the most striking us government assessments to date of iran's ""breakout time"" as efforts to try to restore the iran nuclear agreement remain halted and tehran continues to breach the restrictions set out by the deal. kahl said that ""iran's nuclear progress since"" the trump administration withdrew the united states from the 2015 nuclear deal ""has been remarkable."" ""back in 2018, when the previous administration decided to leave the jcpoa, it would have taken iran about 12 months to produce one fissile, one bomb's worth of fissile material,"" kahl said at a house armed services committee hearing, using the acronym for the formal name of the deal: the joint comprehensive plan of action. ""now it would take about 12 days,"" he said. biden administration officials have for months said that iran's breakout time -- the amount of time it would need to produce enough weapons-grade material for one nuclear bomb -- had dwindled to a matter of weeks. the breakout time does not mean that iran could produce an actual bomb in that amount of time. kahl's comments -- set against reports of iran's continued enrichment of uranium in violation of the deal -- present a striking picture of the challenges facing the increasingly defunct agreement. in a restricted report seen by cnn, the international atomic energy agency confirmed that uranium particles enriched to 83.7% purity -- which is close to the 90% enrichment levels needed to make a nuclear bomb -- had been found in iran's fordow fuel enrichment plant, an underground nuclear facility. according to the confidential iaea report, iran's stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60% had grown by 25.2 kg to 87.5 kg since the agency's last quarterly report. ""it is quite clear that iran enriched uranium to near weapons-grade levels,"" kelsey davenport, the director for nonproliferation policy at the arms control association, told cnn. she said tehran may have been ""testing political responses to higher levels of enrichment or it was experimenting and it got caught,"" noting that it underscores the rapid advancement of iran's nuclear program and the high risk of miscalculation. davenport also told cnn that iran's ""significant increase"" in its enriched uranium stockpiles is ""a serious concern.""

US is reviewing Huawei export license policy amid rising congressional scrutiny of China,2023-02-28,34.0,"the us government is reviewing a policy that permits certain us exports to continue to huawei, despite an overall push by the trump and biden administrations to block the chinese telecommunications giant from receiving american technology. alan estevez, a commerce department official, told lawmakers tuesday that the policy is ""under assessment"" as the agency conducts a ""top-to-bottom review of our export control policies related to the [people's republic of china]."" estevez testified before the house foreign affairs committee, which was holding a hearing to scrutinize china's impact on us national security. in 2019, huawei was one of a number of chinese companies placed on the commerce department's entity list, which prohibits us companies from trading specified items with entities named on the list unless they obtain a license to do so. us officials have expressed concerns that huawei's 5g wireless networking gear could allow the chinese government to spy on american communications. huawei has denied that it poses a security risk, and its founder has said the company would resist any chinese government effort to obtain its data. according to foreign affairs committee chairman michael mccaul, between january and march of 2022 the commerce department approved more than $23 billion in license applications to trade with chinese-affiliated companies on the entity list. confronting estevez at tuesday's hearing, mccaul asked the commerce department to square the license approvals with the us government's wider effort to sideline huawei and similar companies. ""a licensing rule of the previous administration that still stands for huawei allows things below 5g, below cloud-level to go,"" estevez said, ""and i will say that all those things are under assessment."" entity list restrictions do not provide for a ""blanket embargo"" on exports generally, estevez added, but rather reflect specific rules about particular exports. separately, in 2020 the commerce department moved to prevent huawei's suppliers from selling the company semiconductor chips made by us-built software and equipment, unless those suppliers also obtained a license. other parts of the us government have also moved against huawei. the federal communications commission has prohibited us wireless carriers from using federal funding to purchase huawei networking gear, and last year also banned future approvals of huawei equipment for sale in the united states, in the first use of the fcc's equipment authorization authority for a national security purpose.

Blinken's new warning to Beijing is the latest sign of deteriorating US-China relations,2023-02-28,35.0,"the united states directly warned tuesday that it would target chinese firms or people involved in any effort to send lethal aid to russia for its war in ukraine, underscoring a fast-deepening showdown with its superpower rival. in the most specific public admonition on the issue to beijing so far, us secretary of state antony blinken underlined that arming moscow's forces would cause china serious problems around the world. ""china can't have it both ways when it comes to ... the russian aggression in ukraine. it can't be putting forward peace proposals on the one hand, while actually feeding the flames of the fire that russia has started with the other hand,"" blinken said in kazakhstan. us officials have spent the past 10 days warning that it has intelligence that china is considering sending lethal aid to russia, causing fury in beijing and underscoring how already deteriorating diplomatic relations are being rocked by almost daily crises -- from a recent spy balloon controversy to a revived dispute over the specific origins of covid-19. on monday evening, the white house gave federal agencies a 30-day deadline to remove tiktok, which is owned by chinese company bytedance, from federal devices. and later tuesday, a new house select committee will hold its first hearing on the fast-widening us-china rivalry. in his clearest comments about how the us would respond if china did decide to help its ally russia with lethal aid, blinken spoke of punishments for chinese firms that could cause beijing to pay an economic price. ""we did very clearly warn china about the implications and consequences of going through with providing such support,"" referring to his own meeting with top chinese diplomat wang yi in munich this month and president joe biden's talks with president xi jinping in indonesia in november 2022. ""we will not hesitate, for example, to target chinese companies or individuals that violate our sanctions, or otherwise engaged in supporting the russian war effort,"" he said. new confrontations -- along with rising tensions between us and chinese forces in asia and escalating standoffs over taiwan -- are dramatizing a long-building and once theoretical superpower rivalry that is suddenly a daily reality. this increasingly adversarial relationship touches multiple areas of american life -- from the economy to public health. it spans the challenges faced by the us military, which are amid the great geopolitical clashes of the early 21st century like in ukraine to risks posed by the chinese-designed apps on the electronic devices everyone carries everywhere. it's fueling the dangerous possibility that the us and china are locked into a potentially disastrous slide toward conflict. and it poses serious challenges for a polarized us political system that struggles to have a rational debate on these issues without descending into a partisan game of who can be tougher on china. such one-upmanship only deepens a self-perpetuating cycle of escalation between the two sides. it is in this politicized atmosphere that the gop-controlled house is debuting a new bipartisan select committee on competition with china during a primetime hearing on tuesday night, just as washington-beijing tensions have rarely been worse. the committee's work will be based on the premise that after years of trying to integrate china peacefully into the global system as a competitor not an enemy, the us is switching to a tougher stance in a belief that a new generation of chinese leaders is trying to dismantle the us global order and international law. republican rep. mike gallagher, the new committee's chairman, told cnn's manu raju that tuesday's hearing would not focus specifically on the latest drama -- after the department of energy assessed with low confidence that the covid-19 pandemic originated with a lab leak in the chinese city of wuhan. he said that finding, which is a minority view among us intelligence agencies, could be examined in a future hearing but that he wanted to show americans on tuesday that the threat from china was ""not just an over there problem, it's ... right here."" ""we want to understand what we got wrong about the chinese communist party and what we need to understand about it going forward in order to get our policy right,"" the wisconsin republican said. on cbs news on sunday, gallagher warned: ""we may call this a strategic competition, but it's not a tennis match. this is about what type of world we want to live in. do we want to live in xinjiang-lite or do we want to live in the free world?"" he said, referring to the chinese region where the us has accused china of inflicting genocide on the uyghur minority, a charge china continues to vehemently deny. the committee may be one of the few areas where a divided congress -- and potentially the white house -- can find common ground. the biden administration has reinforced the already tough stance toward china that ex-president donald trump adopted later in his presidency. biden, for instance, last year signed a new law that will allow the government to spend $200 billion in a bid to claim the leadership of the semiconductor chips industry -- a critical sector that could decide the economic race between the us and china in decades to come. covid-19 origin controversy starts new pan-pacific war of words the new controversy over the origins of covid-19 is a study in isolation of many of the forces ripping at us-china relations, including us mistrust of the chinese communist party and its leader xi jinping's desire to preserve his prestige and that of a political system he holds up as an alternative to western democracy. us demands for information about the origins of the pandemic show how china is refusing to play by global rules -- in this case, in allowing follow-up virological investigations. all of this only exacerbates intense reaction in washington, and in turn tears at us political fault lines. there is no consensus within the us government on the origins of the pandemic. intelligence agencies remain divided over whether it started with animal to human transmission in a wuhan wet market or originated in a viral leak from a chinese laboratory -- and no new evidence has emerged publicly in support of the lab leak theory. investigating the origins is hugely important. ""there is a bottom line here, which is that neither lab leak, nor spillover -- i.e. animal origin -- can be ruled out. we don't have definitive information,"" tom frieden, the former director of the us centers for disease control and prevention, told cnn on monday. but it didn't take long for republicans to claim political victory in the wake of sunday's wall street journal report about new intelligence causing the department of energy to believe with low confidence that a lab leak was to blame. georgia rep. marjorie taylor greene, who has been accused of spreading conspiracy theories about the pandemic, tweeted, ""conspiracy theorists - 100 media - 0."" republican sen. tom cotton of arkansas tweeted: ""re. china's lab leak, being proven right doesn't matter. what matters is holding the chinese communist party accountable so this doesn't happen again."" such definitive statements, based on one assessment, do not recognize that the us intelligence community is still divided over the matter. some republicans have long sought to prove that the virus was a conspiracy by china to unleash contagion on the world, and many have long appeared to be seeking an explanation for the pandemic that could mask trump's negligence in handling it. but even if the virus did emerge from a laboratory, it doesn't mean it was necessarily man made or that the rest of the world was deliberately exposed. china's foreign ministry reacted angrily to the reemergence of the lab leak theory in washington, warning that americans should ""stop stirring up arguments about laboratory leaks, stop smearing china and stop politicizing the issue of the virus origin."" in many ways, it doesn't matter if poor security at a lab in china or animal transmission caused the pandemic that killed nearly seven million people globally, according to world health organization figures, and more than a million in the us. both possible routes of transmission represent a threat to humanity and need to be addressed, which is one reason why china's lack of transparency on the issue is so potentially dangerous. the pandemic remains a huge embarrassment for china, souring its national mythology of a mighty rising power. but in washington this week, the issue has again degenerated into an excuse for republicans to target scientists and government health experts and to twist a narrative about covid-19 that still has massive gaps. the challenge for the new select committee, which is especially probing economic and technological competition with china, will be to break this cycle of politicization to provide a useful examination of us-china relations that could result in effective policy recommendations down the road. the us and china have a new area of confrontation -- ukraine another example of how the wider antagonism between the united states and china is coloring other crises is evident with ukraine. the us, citing unpublished intelligence, has spent the last week warning that china is considering sending lethal aid to bolster russia's forces -- a situation that would effectively put china on the opposite side of a proxy war with the us and nato powers that have sent billions of dollars in weapons to ukraine. beijing has long amplified russia's justifications for the invasion, which took place a year ago shortly after russian president vladimir putin traveled to the chinese capital to agree to a friendship with ""no limits"" with xi. china would prefer russia, which shares its autocratic form of government, not to suffer a total defeat in ukraine -- which could lead to the ousting of close ally putin. and china increasingly tends to view its global interests through the prism of its standoff with the us, so it may perceive an advantage in washington being locked in an arms-length conflict in ukraine that is costing billions of dollars and to which it is sending reserve military equipment and ammunition that can therefore not be used to bolster its pacific forces. delays in procurement in the us arms industry caused by ukraine could also slow the flow of weapons to taiwan. yet a decision by china to throw in its lot with russia in ukraine would amount to a radical change in foreign policy -- and another massive plunge in us-china relations. washington and the european union would certainly respond with sanctions on chinese firms, a threat that will likely give leaders in beijing pause, as the country's economy slowly recovers from years of covid isolation.

Top Republicans question McCarthy over release of January 6 footage as speaker vows deliberate approach,2023-02-28,36.0,"speaker kevin mccarthy faced questions from his leadership team monday night over his plans to publicly release security footage from january 6, 2021, multiple sources told cnn -- a process that he said could take some time to disseminate widely even as fox news host tucker carlson has had an early glimpse. while gop leaders are supportive of the move to release the footage -- which was one of the many concessions mccarthy made in his bid to become speaker -- some lawmakers in the closed-door leadership meeting asked whether sensitive security protocols or certain evacuation routes would be exposed by taking that step. others questioned how long the footage is going to be dragged out in the press, with some lawmakers concerned about the optics of appearing to try to downplay a deadly insurrection in the us capitol. ""let's just rip the band-aid off and get this over with,"" one gop lawmaker told cnn. sources said mccarthy assured his leadership team that he wants to move swiftly, but said they need to be deliberate about how they handle it to ensure the release does not endanger their security. he also told lawmakers that other media outlets will get access to the footage after carlson airs his exclusive, but it could take a few weeks. cnn, along with a group of other media organizations, has signed on to a letter calling for congressional leaders to grant access to the security footage from the riot. a congressional source familiar with the matter said there were ongoing discussions with the capitol police about what restrictions should be placed on the footage and that it remained unclear exactly what limitations would be on the video that carlson will be allowed to air. but even giving carlson the video footage has spawned widespread concerns, given the conservative host has pushed conspiracy theories about the attack and downplayed the violence at the hands of trump supporters. house gop conference chair elise stefanik of new york confirmed that the topic came up in their leadership meeting and said she fully supports mccarthy's decision to publicly release the footage. she also said republicans would ensure that law enforcement and security protocols are protected. ""unlike democrats, we do work very effectively with the capitol police. and we respect law enforcement,"" stefanik told cnn. ""this is about transparency."" mccarthy, who initially told reporters he would answer questions on monday, left the capitol and avoided reporters and questions about the matter. mccarthy defended his decision to publicly release the footage during a closed-door conference meeting on tuesday morning, according to sources in the room. mccarthy said the release was an important step in the name of transparency and argued that there wasn't outcry when the select committee investigating the january 6, 2021, insurrection showed clips at their public hearings of then-vice president mike pence's evacuation. that select committee never revealed pence's exact escape route but showed photos of him in the garage where he was hiding during the riot. one of mccarthy's closest allies, georgia rep. marjorie taylor greene -- who also has downplayed the january 6 attack -- backed his decision to give the footage to carlson. she told cnn on monday she played a role in mccarthy's decision, but she wouldn't go into further detail. greene, who was not in the monday night meeting, said she's spoken with mccarthy, and that the speaker's office is coordinating a process for how to release the footage more widely, beyond fox news, while also ensuring it doesn't violate any security concerns. ""we can't give away our national security,"" greene said, ""everyone in congress agrees. and i think the american people agree. we don't want russia or china or any of these other countries being able to study all the entries and exits of our capital. that's foolish."" greene told cnn that carlson's team was also given certain parameters for what they could and couldn't air. ""yes ... of course (there were parameters) they're being extremely careful and responsible."" ""i think it is any day now,"" greene told cnn of when to expect some of the footage to air on fox news. florida rep. matt gaetz, who urged the speaker to release the footage as mccarthy was courting his vote for the speakership, would not say if that was part of the commitment made to encourage him to vote ""present"" and help the california republican's cause. ""i think it's getting released,"" gaetz told cnn of the security footage. top democrats, too, are closely monitoring the matter. house democratic leader hakeem jeffries of new york said he and mccarthy ""have not had an extended conversation"" yet about releasing the footage to carlson. ""but i look forward to talking to him this week and further about figuring out an approach that makes sense and respects the security concerns that many members have articulated in the house,"" jeffries said of the speaker. top democrats are waiting to see what footage is ultimately released before taking position on whether the full media should also have access to it, a source familiar with the matter said. asked if he believed the footage should be released widely to the media, jeffries told cnn: ""i have no comment on that right now."" other democrats were outraged at the speaker. democratic rep. bennie thompson of mississippi, who chaired the select committee on january 6, told cnn that mccarthy ""opened up a can of worms"" by agreeing to release the footage to carlson and dinged the california republican for fundraising off the move, which he said puts ""the institution at risk."" this story has been updated with additional developments.",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.959696352481842,0.03415710851550102,0.006146477069705725,-1.0,0,0,0,0,-1.0,-6.361308694857781,8.0,-0.7951635868572227
Four takeaways from DeSantis' new book rehashing his culture clashes as Florida governor,2023-02-27,37.0,"florida gov. ron desantis' new book, ""the courage to be free,"" leans into the culture wars that established him as one of the early republican favorites for the gop nomination for the presidency. while more sparse on biographical details than most political memoirs, the 256-page book offers some new insights into his upbringing, college years and military service. but mostly, desantis rehashes his contentious four years as governor and suggests he has laid a path for others to follow. ""the battles we have fought in florida -- from defeating the biomedical security state to stifling woke corporations to fighting indoctrination in schools -- strike at the heart of what it means to be a floridian and an american,"" desantis writes. the book's release has coincided with the soft-launch of the republican's presidential campaign and it ends with a forward-looking note that alludes at the next challenge ahead. ""the florida blueprint is a simple formula: be willing to lead, have the courage of your convictions, deliver for your constituents, and reap the political rewards. this is a blueprint for america's revival. we've shown it can be done,"" he writes. cnn obtained an advance copy of the book before its publication on tuesday. here are four takeaways: desantis (gently) pushes back against trump desantis largely avoids direct confrontation with former president donald trump, whom he praises for his ""unique star power,"" ""massive following"" and ""filling the void that gop leaders had left by ignoring the preferences of their own voters."" he continued his defense of trump's 2016 campaign against investigations for russian election interference. but desantis expended considerable ink challenging trump's version of the 2018 florida governor race to claim back credit for his victory. trump has claimed desantis ""begged"" for a gubernatorial endorsement in the republican gubernatorial primary -- shed tears even. before trump got involved, desantis was ""dead"" and ""leaving the race,"" the former president recently told conservative radio talk show host hugh hewitt. desantis recalled asking trump in late 2017 ""if he would be willing to send out a tweet touting me as a good candidate for florida governor."" trump, desantis said, ""seemed amenable, but at the same time, i was not holding my breath."" trump did tweet about desantis, calling him ""a brilliant young leader"" and playing up the then-congressman's ivy league credentials. in desantis' telling, he recognized the power of trump's endorsement, but suggested its appeal was limited. ""i do not think republican primary voters are sheep who simply follow an endorsement from a politician they like without any individual analysis, but i do believe that a major endorsement can put a candidate on the radar of gop voters in a way that boosts a good candidate's prospects,"" he writes. desantis later says it was his debate performance, not trump's support, that led to a reversal in the polling. he omitted, though, that trump had tweeted a more forceful ""full endorsement"" of desantis just two months before the primary. nor did he note that trump sent a team of florida operatives to help desantis' campaign after the primary. throughout the book, desantis finds more opportunities to undercut the former president. at several points, desantis bemoans the lack of activity in trump's first two years in office, when republicans controlled the house and senate. though he doesn't blame trump explicitly, when juxtaposed against his own record compelling republican lawmakers in his state to act repeatedly in service of his agenda, the implication seems clear. ""here we had a unified republican government for the first time in more than a decade, and yet so much of the time was frittered away on matters like the conspiracy theory that donald trump's campaign had colluded with russia, which gop-led committees investigated for two years,"" he writes. ""why congress didn't do more significant things, such as appropriating money to build the wall at the us-mexico border, was beyond me."" inside the feud with disney desantis' book frames his battle with disney as a demarcation line in his political story. it's mentioned on the second page of the introduction. the juiciest excerpts from that particular chapter (which he labeled ""the magic kingdom of woke corporatism"") were released in advance to fox news. and, in a symbolic move, he signed the bill to remove disney's special governing powers monday, the eve of his book's release. desantis' views his own political feud with the company as somewhat ironic, given that he married his wife in disney world. he also is quite clear that his wife, casey, who hailed from ""a family of disney enthusiasts,"" was the catalyst for the location of their nuptials. ""my only condition was that no disney characters could be part of our wedding,"" he wrote. ""i wanted our special day to look and feel like a traditional wedding. i didn't want mickey mouse or donald duck in our wedding photos."" his relationship with florida's largest employer broke down last year as outrage intensified over a florida bill to limit the instruction of sexual orientation and gender identity. desantis recalled then-disney ceo bob chapek told him during a phone call that he did not want to get the company involved but was under pressure to weigh in. desantis urged chapek to steer clear and suggested the blowback would pass in 48 hours once there is ""some new outrage that the woke mob will focus on."" ""you will end up putting yourself in an untenable position,"" he recalled telling chapek. ""people like me will say, gee, how come disney has never said anything about china, where they make a fortune?'"" disney ultimately weighed in, saying in a statement that it was ""dedicated to standing up for the rights and safety of lgbtq+ members of the disney family, as well as the lgbtq+ community in florida and across the country."" and desantis pounced, as he said he would. to desantis, the episode is a microcosm of a greater struggle between the fight conservatives expect from gop leaders and the instincts of republicans not to meddle in the affairs of businesses. desantis argues, ""in this environment, old-guard corporate republicanism is not up to the task at hand."" ""unfortunately, the sad upshot of these changes is that corporate america has become a major protagonist in battles over american politics and culture. the battle lines almost invariably find large, publicly traded corporations lining up behind leftist causes,"" he writes. ""it is unthinkable that these large companies would side with conservative americans on issues such as the second amendment, the right to life, election integrity, and religious liberty."" desantis vs. desantis desantis' first book, the little-read ""dreams from our founding fathers"" published in 2011, is a case for limited government, separation of powers, humble leadership and executive constraint. desantis' latest book is a defense of his most contentious executive actions, achieved by consolidating power and flexing executive authority, in ways that suggest he has undergone an evolution of his previous principles. in ""the courage to be free,"" desantis -- the former star athlete and naval officer -- demonstrates a tactical precision for using his executive powers in ways intended to keep democrats and the media off guard in pursuit of an aggressive and partisan agenda. he brought to the job, he writes, ""an understanding of how a constitutional form of government operates, the various pressure points that exist, and the best way to leverage authority to achieve substantial policy victories."" ""one of my first orders of business after getting elected was to have my transition team amass an exhaustive list of all the constitutional, statutory, and customary powers of the governor. i wanted to be sure that i was using every lever available to advance our priorities,"" he writes. desantis, looking to jumpstart his political career in 2011, eviscerated then-president barack obama for what he described as executive overreach. he accused obama's then-health and human services secretary, kathleen sebelius, of using ""her power to intimidate private businesses for engaging in speech she didn't like."" he wrote obama was ""resorting to using crude vulgarisms, such as the term 'teabagger,' to describe their fellow citizens simply because these citizens dissented from progressive orthodoxy."" but in ""the courage to be free,"" labeling corporations as ""woke"" and punishing those that speak out ""is not only prudent but necessary to counteract efforts by large corporations to impose a woke agenda on the rest of us."" as desantis writes: ""it is regrettable that our nation has become so politicized, but the fact is that private companies wielding de facto public power is not in the best interests of most americans."" continuing to litigate his coronavirus response desantis built his reelection for governor around his response to covid-19 and his book makes clear he will continue to make that a part of his message as he looks toward a potential campaign for president. as he often does, desantis described florida as a ""citadel of freedom in the united states,"" and defended his actions to reopen schools for the 2020-2021 school year. ""when i announced florida's back to school policy, perhaps because i did so during the height of the summer covid-19 wave, there was substantial public opposition to my decision,"" desantis says. ""for all the controversy that swirled around my decision, and all the incoming fire i took by making it, there was never a doubt in my mind that keeping our schools open was right for our state."" ""keeping florida free"" from covid-19 restrictions has earned desantis criticism from democrats and health experts -- a badge he proudly wears. but desantis also puts up his response against the rest of the country, even trump, who he noted stood behind health officials who pushed states to shut down activity for two weeks to slow the spread. desantis also shared insight into his efforts to open up florida for sports, including a promise to ufc president dana white to big foot any local government that prevented him from holding fights in florida. ""i will overrule any mayor that gives you guys a hard time,"" desantis told white. desantis called for a ""thorough and unbiased investigation of all aspects of the pandemic,"" including the origins of the virus. on monday, john kirby, national security council coordinator for strategic communications, said, ""there is not a consensus right now, in the us government about exactly how covid got started. there is just not an intelligence community consensus."" kirby added that biden made trying to find the origins of covid a ""priority.""

What to watch for as the Supreme Court hears oral arguments on Biden's student loan debt relief plan,2023-02-28,38.0,"the supreme court on tuesday will take up two challenges to president joe biden's student loan forgiveness program -- an initiative aimed at providing targeted debt relief to millions of student-loan borrowers -- that has so far been stalled by legal challenges. republican-led states and conservatives challenging the program say it amounts to an unlawful attempt to erase an estimated $430 billion of federal student loan debt under the guise of the pandemic. at the heart of the case is the department of education's authority to forgive the loans. several of the conservative justices have signaled in recent years that agencies -- with no direct accountability to the public -- have become too powerful, upsetting the separation of powers. they have moved to cut back on the so-called administrative state. in 2021, for instance, the court invalidated the biden administration's covid-19-related eviction moratorium issued by the us centers for disease control and prevention holding that such a program needs to be specifically authorized by congress. in 2022, the court blocked a nationwide vaccine or testing mandate for large businesses, sending a clear message that the occupational safety and health administration had overstepped its authority. tuesday's cases will also highlight an important threshold question that could block the court from reaching the merits of the dispute: whether the parties behind the challenge have the legal right, or ""standing,"" necessary to bring suit. payments paused in 2020, as the covid pandemic began, the department of education paused payments and interest in accrual on student loans to help those struggling financially. as the pandemic progressed, both the trump and the biden administrations further extended the protections. by 2022, however, the biden administration's secretary of education, miguel cardona, determined that the across-the-board pause on all payments should come to an end. fearing that the resumption of payments would put many lower-income borrowers at heightened risk of loan delinquency, the administration said it would offer relief up to $20,000 to approximately 40 million working and middle-class borrowers. the plan, biden said, was meant to ""provide more breathing room for people so they have less burden by student debt."" the initiative came under immediate attack. a district court blocked the program citing the so-called major questions doctrine. under the doctrine, federal agencies cannot regulate matters of ""vast economic and political significance"" without clear authorization from congress. (last june, the supreme court emboldened supporters of the doctrine by citing it in a 6-3 decision that curbed the environmental protection agency's ability to broadly regulate carbon emissions from existing power plants.) as other challenges to the student loan program percolated, the biden administration asked the supreme court to step in and allow the program to go into effect pending appeal. the justices declined to do so, but they agreed to hear two cases on an expedited basis. the first dispute, biden v. nebraska, pits the administration against a group of republican-led states. the second, department of education v. brown, was initially brought by myra brown and alexander taylor, two individuals who did not qualify for the program and argue the government failed to follow proper rulemaking process when putting it in place. as for the payment obligations, they were set to resume last january, but the president issued an extension due to the fact that his loan forgiveness program was stalled in court. as things stand, the payment pause will last until 60 days after the litigation over the loan forgiveness program is resolved. if the program has not been implemented and the litigation has not been resolved by june 30, payment will resume 60 days after that, according to the government. what the biden administration is saying at the supreme court, the biden administration argues that the secretary of education had the clear authority to provide the relief to borrowers making less than $125,000 per year ($250,000 for households) in 2020 or 2021 in order to protect them from financial harms brought on by the pandemic such as the inability to buy food or make rent or mortgage payments. in court papers, solicitor general elizabeth prelogar stressed that the higher education relief opportunities for students act of 2003 -- known as the heroes act -- provides the government with the authority to offer the relief. under the law, passed to help active-duty military in the wake of the september 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the government says the secretary of education has the authority to act in a national emergency to make sure borrowers are not left worse off with respect to their loans than they were before the emergency. she warned the justices that ending the pause in payments without providing additional relief for lower-income borrowers would ""cause delinquency and default rates to spike above pre-pandemic levels."" prelogar rejected claims that the department of education had exceeded its authority under the major questions doctrine. ""this is not a case where the agency relied on statutory language that is vague, cryptic, ancillary, or modest,"" she said, noting that the grant of authority is ""central"" to the heroes act. in addition, she said that neither the states nor the two individual plaintiffs behind the challenges have the standing to file suit. she warned that if the justices held otherwise, it could have ""startling implications"" going forward. ""virtually all federal actions -- from prosecuting crime to imposing taxes to managing property -- have some incidental effects on state finances,"" she said. what the states are saying as for the states, nebraska attorney general michael t. hilgers, who is also representing missouri, arkansas, iowa, kansas and south carolina, stressed that the biden administration exceeded its authority by using the pandemic as a pretext to mask the true goal of fulfilling a campaign promise to erase student-loan debt. ""canceling hundreds of billions of dollars in student loans -- through a decree that extends to nearly all borrowers -- is a breathtaking assertion of power and a matter of great economic and political significance,"" triggering the major questions doctrine, hilgers told the court. such a cancellation power ""is the type of major question that courts presume congress reserves for itself."" hilgers rejected the government's contention that the states can't show the harm necessary to get into court. in court papers he put forward multiple theories of standing that mostly revolve around the theory that the states will lose tax revenue. a federal appeals court focused on one of the states behind the challenge, missouri, and pointed to a state created entity called missouri higher education loan authority (mohela) that has contracted with the federal department of education to service student loans. the court said that because mohela will stop receiving servicing fees for loans discharged under the new plan, mohela won't be able to fulfill its obligation to contribute a specified amount of money to the state treasury. the appeals court ruled mohela is akin to a state entity and therefore said that it satisfied the standing requirement. critics of that theory say that mohela was established with financial and legal independence from the state of missouri and the vast amount of its funds are segregated from state funds. they believe that for the purpose of the lawsuit, mohela cannot be considered an ""arm of the state."" the red states are supported by a group of former government officials including former trump attorney general william barr, former trump white house chief of saff mick mulvaney and others who say that biden should not be able to forgive billions of dollars in student loan debt ""owed by 43 million borrowers who financed a college education with the benefit of tax payer-funded loans."" ""this represents one of the largest expenditures in the nation's history, carried out in the face of clear congressional opposition,"" they wrote.

The 10 biggest revelations from Dominion's explosive Fox News legal filing,2023-02-28,39.0,"fox news continues to be exposed for the dishonest organization that it is — this time, with the help of its billionaire owner. a monday filing in dominion voting systems' $1.6 billion lawsuit against the right-wing talk channel offered additional revelations — including the fact that fox corporation chair rupert murdoch admitted in a deposition that some of his top hosts were pushing election lies to his audience. murdoch rejected that fox news, as an entity, endorsed former president donald trump's election lies. but murdoch conceded that sean hannity, jeanine pirro, maria bartiromo, and former host lou dobbs promoted falsehoods about the 2020 presidential contest being stolen. ""yes. they endorsed,"" murdoch said, according to the filing, when asked about the hosts' promotion of false claims about the election. a version of this article first appeared in the ""reliable sources"" newsletter. sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. ""i would have liked us to be stronger in denouncing it, in hindsight,"" the media mogul added at another point in the deposition. that's just one of the several revelations included in monday's filing. here are some additional highlights: ► in the wake of the election, murdoch wrote in an email to the new york post's col allan, describing election lies that trump was pushing as ""bulls**t and damaging."" ► murdoch said it was ""wrong"" for tucker carlson to host conspiracy theorist mike lindell after the election. when asked why he continued to allow the mypillow ceo to continue appearing on fox news, murdoch signaled it was a business decision. ""it is not red or blue, it is green,"" he said. that's a shocking admission from murdoch about what actually guides coverage at fox news. ► behind the scenes, paul ryan repeatedly warned the murdochs to stop allowing the spread of election lies. the former house speaker said that fox news should ""move on from donald trump"" and ""stop spouting election lies."" ryan told the murdochs that many of those who thought the election had been stolen did so ""because they got a diet of information telling them the election was stolen from what they believe were credible sources."" he was not wrong. ► murdoch responded to one email from ryan by telling him that sean hannity had ""been privately disgusted by trump for weeks, but was scared to lose viewers."" in other words, hannity, who always claims to say the same things on camera as when he's off camera, was not being up front with his loyal audience for fear they'd rebel against him. ► murdoch gave jared kushner ""confidential information"" about then-candidate joe biden's ads ""along with debate strategy"" in 2020, the filing said, offering trump's son-in-law ""a preview of biden's ads before they were public."" at most news organizations, this type of action would result in an investigation and disciplinary measures. ► murdoch asked fox news ceo suzanne scott to have hannity say ""something supportive"" about republican sen. lindsey graham ahead of the 2020 election. murdoch explained, ""we cannot lose the senate if at all possible."" in other words, murdoch was directing the head of his talk network to help the gop. again, this type of directive from an executive would be a major scandal at an actual news network. ► when shepard smith attacked the ""trump administration's 'lies'"" on air, rupert emailed scott and fox news president jay wallace calling it ""over the top!"" and telling them, ""need to chat to him."" in another instance, lachlan murdoch told scott that then-correspondent leland vittert was ""smug and obnoxious"" when reporting from a nov. 14 pro-trump rally. murdoch said the tone should be a ""celebration of the president."" ► despite fox accurately calling the race in arizona for biden, murdoch suggested firing bill sammon, then the head of the network's washington bureau. ""maybe best to let bill go right away,"" which would ""be a big message with trump people"" the filing said. sammon was later ""told the inevitable"" that day on nov. 20, 2020. ► murdoch said he ""suggested or urged"" the firing of host lou dobbs because he ""was an extremist,"" but allowed him to continue hosting a program at the network until after the election. dominion argues that's because dobbs was popular with trump and his supporters and the network was fending off viewer defections to newsmax. in totality, the documents continue to underscore that at its core, fox news is not a news network. news networks work hard to deliver the truth to their viewers. these documents reveal that fox news executives and hosts knew the truth and yet they peddled election lies to the audience. and when the handful of hosts and correspondents who have integrity at the channel tried to be honest with viewers, the highest levels of fox news worked against them. the documents lay bare that the channel's business model is not based on informing its audience, but rather on feeding them content — even dangerous conspiracy theories — that keeps viewers happy and watching. in response, fox news said in a statement that dominion's lawsuit ""has always been more about what will generate headlines than what can withstand legal and factual scrutiny."" the network added, ""their summary judgment motion took an extreme, unsupported view of defamation law that would prevent journalists from basic reporting and their efforts to publicly smear fox for covering and commenting on allegations by a sitting president of the united states should be recognized for what it is: a blatant violation of the first amendment."" top legal experts cnn has spoken with disagree with fox news' assessment of dominion's legal filings. but even if dominion does not prevail in court, it has left a permanent stain on the channel and revealed its true motives.",9.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.573270943429735,0.28804893884807825,0.13868012584538925,-0.3798121257207498,0,0,0,0,-3.418309131486748,-6.513020459061806,30.0,-0.21710068196872687
Rupert Murdoch acknowledged that Fox News hosts endorsed false stolen election claims,2023-02-27,40.0,"rupert murdoch, the chairman of fox corporation, acknowledged in a deposition taken by dominion voting systems that some fox news hosts endorsed false claims that the 2020 election was stolen. murdoch's remarks were made public in a legal filing as part of dominion's $1.6 billion lawsuit against fox news. in his deposition, murdoch rejected that the right-wing talk network as an entity endorsed former president donald trump's election lies. but murdoch conceded that sean hannity, jeanine pirro, maria bartiromo, and former host lou dobbs promoted the falsehood about the presidential contest being stolen. ""some of our commentators were endorsing it,,"" murdoch said, according to the filing, when asked about the talk hosts' on-air positions about the election. ""i would have liked us to be stronger in denouncing it, in hindsight,"" he added. the filing also revealed that murdoch referred to some of trump's 2020 election lies as ""bulls**t and damaging."" fox calls dominion lawsuit 'dubious' in a monday statement, fox news assailed dominion. ""dominion's lawsuit has always been more about what will generate headlines than what can withstand legal and factual scrutiny,"" the network said, ""as illustrated by them now being forced to slash their fanciful damages demand by more than half a billion dollars after their own expert debunked its implausible claims."" ""their summary judgment motion took an extreme, unsupported view of defamation law that would prevent journalists from basic reporting and their efforts to publicly smear fox for covering and commenting on allegations by a sitting president of the united states should be recognized for what it is: a blatant violation of the first amendment,"" the network added. fox on monday defended the actions of executives and hosts during the 2020 election in its own legal filings countering dominion voting systems' lawsuit. fox alleged that its hosts' on-air assertions about election fraud were taken out of context. fox says it should not be held liable for the hosts' claims. ""dominion's summary judgment motion is flawed from top to bottom and should be rejected in its entirety,"" lawyers for fox news wrote in its filing monday. fox corporation said in its filing that dominion ""has produced zero evidentiary support for its dubious theory that high-level executives at fox corporation 'chose to publish and broadcast' or played a 'direct role in the creation and publication' of false election lies."" fox hosts ridicule election fraud claims in another filing made public earlier this month, a trove of messages and emails from the most prominent stars and highest-ranking executives at fox news showed they had privately ridiculed claims of election fraud in the 2020 election, despite the right-wing channel promoting lies about the presidential contest on its air. the messages showed that tucker carlson, sean hannity, and laura ingraham brutally mocked lies being pushed by former president donald trump's camp asserting that the election was rigged. the court filings have offered the most vivid picture to date of the chaos that transpired behind the scenes at fox news after trump lost the election and viewers rebelled against the right-wing channel for accurately calling the contest in biden's favor. top legal experts told cnn after last week's filing that dominion's legal position appeared strong. ""it's a major blow,"" renowned first amendment attorney floyd abrams said of dominion's motion for a summary judgment, adding that the ""recent revelations certainly put fox in a more precarious situation"" in defending against the lawsuit on first amendment grounds. rebecca tushnet, the frank stanton professor of first amendment law at harvard law school, described dominion's evidence as a ""very strong"" filing that ""clearly lays out the difference between what fox was saying publicly and what top people at fox were privately admitting."" tushnet said that in her years of practicing and teaching law, she had never seen such damning evidence collected in the pre-trial phase of a defamation suit. ""i don't recall anything comparable to this,"" tushnet said. ""donald trump seems to be very good at generating unprecedented situations."" murdoch said it was 'wrong' for tucker carlson to host election conspiracy theorist mike lindell in his deposition, murdoch also said that it was ""wrong"" for fox's tucker carlson to have hosted election conspiracy theorist mike lindell on his program following the presidential election. murdoch testified it was ""wrong for tucker to host mike lindell to repeat those allegations against dominion on january 26th, 2021,"" the documents said. when asked why he continued to allow lindell, the mypillow ceo, to make election fraud claims on fox news, murdoch said it was a business decision. ""it is not red or blue, it is green,"" murdoch replied, according to the court documents. ""the man is on every night. pays us a lot of money..."" murdoch said. ""at first you think it's comic, and then you get bored and irritated."" murdoch also said he could have stopped rudy giuliani and sidney powell, former lawyers for president trump and his campaign who alleged election fraud, from appearing on the network's programs, the filing said. ""i could have. but i didn't,"" murdoch said. paul ryan warned murdochs, fox to stop spreading false election narratives court documents monday showed that paul ryan repeatedly warned murdoch and fox news of the dangerous effects that discussing false election fraud narratives on air would have with viewers. ryan, the former house speaker and a fox corporation board member, repeatedly told rupert and fox corporation ceo lachlan murdoch that the company ""should not be spreading conspiracy theories."" on at least one occasion, ryan advised the murdochs that the company should ""move on from donald trump and stop spouting election lies."" during this time, ryan told the murdochs that many of those who thought the election had been stolen did so ""because they got a diet of information telling them the election was stolen from what they believe were credible sources."" ""the sooner we can put down the echoes of falsehoods from our side, the faster we can get onto principled loyal opposition,"" ryan wrote to rupert. ""i truly hope our contributors, along with tucker, laura, and sean get that and execute."" rupert responded to ryan, noting that ""everything changed"" following the events of january 6, 2021, and asked the former speaker turned fox executive for suggestions for contributors. murdoch gave kushner 'confidential information' about biden ads also revealed in dominion's filing, rupert murdoch gave jared kushner, son-in-law of former president donald trump, ""confidential information about [president joe] biden's ads, along with debate strategy"" in 2020, ""providing kushner a preview of biden's ads before they were public,"" the court filing states. murdoch, under oath, also said that on election night, kushner called him upset about the media's coverage of the election that was ultimately called for biden. murdoch testified that kushner said, ""this is terrible"" and murdoch could ""hear trump's voice in the background shouting."" murdoch said he replied, ""well, the numbers are the numbers."" according to the filing, murdoch said that he believed no fraud had occurred in the election. ""yes. i mean, we thought everything was on the up-and-up. i think that was shown when we announced arizona,"" murdoch said, referring to fox news' projection on election night that joe biden would win the critical battleground state. a kushner spokesperson did not immediately respond to a cnn request for comment. - cnn's liam reilly and nicki brown contributed to this report",9.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.7003027035130395,0.18062228823287618,0.11907500683123039,-0.664421909999555,0,0,0,0,-5.9797971899959945,-11.476916880402365,37.0,-0.31018694271357744
Covid 'lab leak theory': What we've learned,2023-02-27,41.0,"an updated intelligence assessment about the origins of the covid-19 virus has reopened the long-simmering and unsolved debate about how the virus came to be -- and will fuel a new committee house republicans have created to investigate the issue. while scientists still predominantly believe the virus occurred naturally in animals and spread to humans in an outbreak at a market in wuhan, china, the us department of energy's office of intelligence and counterintelligence is now the second tentacle of the us government intelligence apparatus, along with the fbi, that endorses the ""lab leak theory"" -- the minority view that the virus occurred as a result of work in a chinese lab. the doe office is one of 18 government agencies that make up the intelligence community, which are under the umbrella of the office of the director of national intelligence. most of the intelligence community remains either split or leaning toward the natural occurrence theory that scientific investigations have concluded as most likely. but without conclusive evidence, no one has been able to reject the lab leak theory entirely. the theory has been the subject of much focus by republican lawmakers, and polling in 2021 suggested a majority of americans believe the chinese government had something to do with the origins of the virus. asked whether they believe the virus originated from a laboratory leak in china or from human contact with an infected animal, about half (52%) said that they believed a lab leak was responsible. now in the house majority, republicans have formed a special subcommittee of the house oversight committee specifically to investigate, among other things, china's role in the early spread of the virus and us government dollars that helped fund some research at the wuhan institute of virology, the research facility at the center of the lab leak theory. lack of answers about the origins of covid-19 and an accumulation of circumstantial evidence have led some scientists, the biden administration and the world health organization to argue that the lab leak theory needs more study. if only china was cooperating. us lawmakers who have pushed the lab leak theory seized on reporting about the new department of energy assessment, although the details of what led to the assessment are not yet public. ""i'm pleased the department of energy has finally reached the same conclusion that i had already come to,"" rep. michael mccaul of texas, chairman of the foreign affairs committee, said in a statement. sen. josh hawley of missouri demanded more information about the department of energy's assessment and promised to push for more such reports to be declassified. still a minority view the change in opinion by the energy department's intelligence office is far from a total backing of the ""lab leak"" theory. for starters, the conclusion was reached only with ""low confidence,"" as opposed to medium or high confidence. cnn's jeremy herb and natasha bertrand explain the confidence levels: intelligence agencies can make assessments with either low, medium or high confidence. a low confidence assessment generally means that the information obtained is not reliable enough or is too fragmented to make a more definitive analytic judgment or that there is not enough information available to draw a more robust conclusion. it's not clear what exactly changed things for the officials involved in the assessment for the department of energy, but whatever it was has not convinced the majority of intelligence agencies. according to a two-page list of takeaways from the initial 2021 intelligence community review of covid-19 origins ordered by president joe biden, four components of the intelligence community and the national intelligence council believed, like most scientists, that ""natural exposure"" caused the virus. three elements of the intelligence community did not believe there was enough evidence to make a determination. and one agency, which cnn has reported is the fbi, had medium confidence in the lab leak theory. there is agreement on some key points while the intelligence community remains very much split on what led to the virus, they were completely aligned on three key points when they first issued a two-page unclassified report in 2021: the virus was not developed as a biological weapon.most of the agencies believe the virus was not genetically engineered. (two agencies did not think there was sufficient evidence to make an assessment either way.)chinese officials did not have ""foreknowledge of the virus"" before the initial outbreak. something everyone seems to agree on is that china has not been cooperative in figuring out how the virus evolved. previous investigations have not answered the question cnn's chief medical correspondent dr. sanjay gupta did a long-form report in 2021 about all of the available evidence and talked to multiple people who had assessed the available evidence. a. chris gajilan has an extensive report on what is to be learned from all of that, and how a key who assessment was flawed due to a lack of cooperation from the chinese government. dr. anthony fauci -- the former director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases whom republicans have told they will call before congress to testify about the origins of the disease -- has consistently repeated he believes the virus most likely occurred naturally, since other, similar viruses have evolved that way. but he has been careful to add that it's important to keep an ""open mind"" about the lab leak possibility. an open and high-level commission could help while there are multiple theories about how it happened, there is also a realization that we may never know. ""unfortunately, i don't think that we will ever get a real answer,"" cnn national security analyst peter bergen said monday morning. he argued the us government should get ahead of politically divisive theories and empanel a bipartisan group to write a definitive and public report. ""we have never had a covid commission like the 9/11 commission,"" he said. ""i think we desperately need it. because more americans have died of covid than have died in every american war since the american revolution, which is an astonishing number; that is a major national security issue."" china should 'be more honest' the state department renewed its criticism of china's openness about the origins of the virus on monday. ""if we're going to do something to strengthen the world health organization, then we're going to have to push china to be more active in it, and to of course, be more honest about what happened three years ago in wuhan with the origin of the covid-19 crisis,"" us ambassador to china nicholas burns told reporters. state department spokesman ned price, in separate comments to reporters, accused china of ""blocking from the beginning international investigators and members of the global health community from accessing information that they need to understand the origins of covid-19."" 'regardless, we know the next step' cnn's john king asked dr. megan ranney, deputy dean of the school of public health at brown university, why it matters, at this point, where the virus came from. ranney argued that if the virus came from a lab leak, it means the world needs better biosecurity protocols. if the virus came from animal-to-human transmission, we need to be able to respond more quickly to outbreaks. ""regardless, we know the next step,"" ranney said. ""while we're focusing on where covid-19 started, we're not spending time about how to keep america from ever having to go through the last three years again."" 'the evidence isn't there' king also talked to beth sanner, the former deputy director of national intelligence for mission integration during the trump administration, about the report. ""if you want to blame somebody in terms of how this all unfolded, it's very clear that china hid this, did not move quickly enough, and now is blocking investigation,"" she said. but she said it's important to look at the entire analysis of the intelligence community, which is based on evidence. and the evidence does not conclusively point to any one theory. ""we don't just take information or just take a feeling and turn it into analysis,"" she said.

Opinion: Scott Adams has only himself to blame for Dilbert's troubles,2023-02-27,42.0,"scott adams -- creator of the once popular ""dilbert"" comic strip that lampoons corporate culture -- apparently doesn't like being held accountable for his recent undeniably racist rant in which he called black americans a ""hate group"" and urged white people to ""get the hell away"" from them. on saturday, in response to the fierce backlash over his remarks after hundreds of newspapers dropped his comic strip, adams whined about being targeted for ""cancellation."" in reality, this is not ""cancel culture,"" but ""consequence culture"" where people are rightly held accountable for their words and actions. adams' bigoted diatribe was posted wednesday on his youtube show, ""real coffee with scott adams."" the trump-supporting cartoonist cited a poll by rasmussen, a conservative polling company, that claimed 53% of the black americans who were surveyed agreed with the statement, ""it's ok to be white."" if that phrase strikes you as odd, that may not be surprising. as the anti-defamation league has noted, the statement was made popular in the white supremacist movement as a way to troll liberals. unexplained, as of yet, is why rasmussen used a white supremacist-coined phrase in their poll. the poll results caused adams to hysterically exclaim that, ""if nearly half of all blacks are not ok with white people...that's a hate group."" in fact, the polling company said that 26% of black americans agreed with that view. adams added about blacks, ""i don't want to have anything to do with them."" and he went even further: ""i don't think it makes any sense as a white citizen of america to try to help black citizens anymore...there's no longer a rational impulse. so, i'm going to back off on being helpful to black america because it doesn't seem like it pays off."" he didn't elaborate about what kind of so-called help he provided to black americans in the past. the cartoonist then offered a piece of advice to his fellow white americans: ""i would say, based on the current way things are going, the best advice i would give to white people is to get the hell away from black people, just get the f**k away...because there is no fixing this."" i imagine that the ghosts of segregationists were cheering this sentiment. for its part, rasmussen wrote in a tweet on friday, ""astroturf has finally discovered our 'ok to be white?' poll, inspired by the @adl literally defining the wording of the question as 'hate speech',"" -- adding a clown emoji in the message. it's not surprising that a broad cross-section of newspapers in this country no longer want to be associated with adams. the washington post, houston chronicle and the usa today network that includes more than 300 local media outlets in 43 states were among the publications announcing they would no longer be running dilbert. in response to the backlash, adams first defended his comments by tweeting that he was only ""advising people to avoid hate."" it wasn't long however before he claimed he was being made a victim for speaking his mind. ""by monday, i should be mostly canceled,"" he said on saturday, adding, ""my reputation for the rest of my life is destroyed. you can't come back from this."" aww, poor multi-millionaire adams. he is being held accountable for his words -- which as of now he has not apologized for, but instead defended. this is not the first time adams has invoked white victimhood for his own failings and unfairly targeted black americans. in june 2020, adams cited the tv network upn's cancellation of his ""dilbert"" animated primetime tv series by tweeting, ""i lost my tv show for being white when upn decided it would focus on an african american audience. that was the third job i lost for being white."" in reality -- as variety reported -- the show was canceled because of a huge drop in ratings. adams is just a prime example of the era we live in, a time when some people will say racist or bigoted remarks and then play the victim card, alleging that they have been victimized by ""cancel culture"" in hopes of silencing their critics. in the minds of people like him, freedom of expression means being free to spew all the hate-filled garbage they want and in response, requiring the rest of us to bite our tongues. but that's not how free speech works. people will and should push back against bigotry. in this case, adams was not just criticized by those offended by his vile views. publications he's been associated with for years no longer want anything to do with him. this is what consequence culture looks like. if you don't like the consequences, then don't spew hate.

Rep. Elissa Slotkin entering race to succeed retiring Michigan Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow,2023-02-27,43.0,"michigan rep. elissa slotkin is entering the race to replace retiring democratic sen. debbie stabenow, with a campaign launch video on her youtube page and a us senate campaign website up. the announcement makes slotkin the first democrat to officially declare a bid in what is likely to be among the most competitive and expensive senate contests in 2024. in the three-minute-long video, slotkin talks about growing up in michigan, entering public service after 9/11 and going on to work for the cia. ""look, we all know america is going through something right now. we seem to be living crisis to crisis. but there are certain things that should be really simple,"" slotkin says in the video. ""this is why i'm running for the united states senate. we need a new generation of leaders that thinks differently, works harder, and never forgets that we are public servants."" slotkin won reelection to the us house in one of michigan's top battleground districts in 2022. according to her most recent fec filing, slotkin had about $130,000 in her campaign account at the end of 2022. michigan's senate seat is crucial for democrats. the party is defending 23 of the 34 senate seats up for reelection next year, including three seats in states that backed former president donald trump by at least 8 points in 2020: west virginia, montana and ohio. besides michigan, the party is also defending seats in other battleground states such as arizona, nevada, pennsylvania and wisconsin. other potential candidates for the seat include republican reps. bill huizenga and john james, democratic rep. debbie dingell, and democratic state sen. mallory mcmorrow, who drew national attention last year in a floor speech pushing back against anti-lgbtq attacks from a republican colleague. james lost a closer-than-expected race to stabenow in 2018 and then narrowly lost a bid for the state's other senate seat in 2020, before winning election to the house in november from a swing seat north of detroit. several other democrats who have been considered potential candidates, such as michigan gov. gretchen whitmer, transportation secretary pete buttigieg and rep. dan kildee, have said they are not running. this story has been updated with additional details and background information.",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.07466196268796921,0.4284127950668335,0.4969251751899719,0.9619421447498049,0,0,0,0,0.9619421447498049,-7.83928130077672,21.0,-0.37329910956079615
New assessment on the origins of Covid-19 adds to the confusion,2023-02-27,44.0,"""we want to know what led to this, so we can hopefully try and prevent something similar from happening in the future."" those words, from dr. david relman, an infectious disease expert and microbiologist at stanford university, reflected the national conversation around the origins of covid-19 in 2021. did it come from a lab? was it a zoonotic transfer? something else? surely, with time, an answer would become clear. but now, three years removed from the start of a pandemic that is still disrupting daily life, an assessment from the us energy department is only adding to the confusion about what really happened in wuhan, china, in late 2019. the department has assessed that the covid-19 pandemic most likely emerged from a laboratory leak in china, according to a newly updated classified intelligence report first reported by the wall street journal on sunday. yet two sources said that the department assessed in the intelligence report that it had ""low confidence"" that the coronavirus accidentally escaped from a lab in wuhan, cnn's jeremy herb and natasha bertrand reported. intelligence agencies can make assessments with either low, medium or high confidence; and a low confidence assessment generally means that the information obtained is not reliable enough or is too fragmented to make a more definitive analytic judgment or that there is not enough information available to draw a more robust conclusion. national security adviser jake sullivan acknowledged on cnn's ""state of the union"" on sunday that the intelligence community is divided on the matter, while noting that president joe biden has put resources into getting to the bottom of the origin question. the intelligence community has been split on the matter for years. in 2021, the intelligence community declassified a report that showed four agencies in the intelligence community had assessed with low confidence that the virus likely jumped from animals to humans naturally in the wild. one assessed with moderate confidence that the pandemic was the result of a laboratory accident. three other intelligence community elements were unable to coalesce around either explanation without additional information, the community's report said. lab leak theory gains traction for the better part of 2020, advocates of the lab leak theory had to fight against claims they were being xenophobic or racist — in part thanks to anti-chinese rhetoric from then-president donald trump, who embraced the theory. an inquiry launched by trump's state department, which sought to investigate whether china's biological weapons program could have had a greater role in the pandemic's origin in wuhan, was shut down early on in the biden administration. a letter from public health experts published in february 2020 in the lancet, an influential scientific journal, also set the tone early by declaring the virus to have a natural origin. but the lab leak theory has gained more traction with time, especially following reports that the intelligence community found evidence that researchers at the wuhan institute of virology fell seriously ill with a mysterious virus in november 2019 -- although it's not clear whether they contracted covid-19 and no further evidence has emerged to corroborate that report. by july 2021, senior biden administration officials overseeing an intelligence review into the origins believed that the lab leak theory was at least as credible as the possibility that the virus emerged naturally in the wild -- a dramatic shift from a year earlier, when democrats publicly downplayed such an idea. 'not a definitive answer' the latest intelligence assessment was provided to congress as republicans on capitol hill have been pushing for further investigation into the theory, while accusing the biden administration of playing down its possibility. house foreign affairs chairman michael mccaul said sunday he was ""pleased"" the energy department ""has finally reached the same conclusion that i had already come to."" (the texas republican had released a 2021 report that concluded that ""the preponderance of the evidence"" showed the pandemic originated with a leak from the wuhan lab.) ""now is the time for the entire biden administration to join the department of energy, the federal bureau of investigation, and the majority of americans by publicly concluding what common sense told us at the start -- the covid-19 pandemic originated from a lab leak in wuhan, china,"" mccaul said in a statement. sullivan said sunday that biden had directed the national laboratories, which are part of the department of energy, to be brought into the assessment. ""right now, there is not a definitive answer that has emerged from the intelligence community on this question,"" sullivan told cnn's dana bash. ""some elements of the intelligence community have reached conclusions on one side, some on the other. a number of them have said they just don't have enough information to be sure."" so where does that leave us? not far from where we started. past pandemics have emerged from natural transmission through animals, and it often takes months or years to discover the host that the virus passed through as it adapted to infect humans. in some cases, as in ebola, the original natural source has never been identified. and it's been more than 40 years since the first cases of ebola. so why does it matter where covid-19 came from? as relman, the stanford microbiologist, previously noted to cnn, finding the answer can help prevent the next pandemic.",2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.44359308760613203,0.5152466297149658,0.04116030037403107,-0.4823515960652744,0,0,0,0,-0.9647031921305488,-5.385675361420519,14.0,-0.3846910972443228
GOP grapples with how to control Trump -- again,2023-02-27,45.0,"gop leaders are sending warnings that they want former president donald trump to play by the rules and put his party above his own interests as he embarks on a third campaign -- that is, to behave in a way he rarely, if ever, has before. republican national committee chair ronna mcdaniel gave the clearest sign yet on cnn's ""state of the union"" sunday that 2024 gop white house candidates will have to pledge to back the party's presidential nominee if it isn't them -- or risk being banned from the debate stage. ""i think it's kind of a no-brainer, right?"" mcdaniel told dana bash, adding that formal criteria haven't yet been established for the first debate in august. ""if you're going to be on the republican national committee debate stage asking voters to support you, you should say, 'i'm going to support the voters and who they choose as the nominee,'"" mcdaniel added. the former president, who signed a loyalty pledge in 2015, responded with his typical hubris on sunday, despite recent polling showing that enthusiasm for him among the gop isn't what it used to be. ""president trump will support the republican nominee because it will be him,"" a campaign spokesperson told cnn in response to mcdaniel's prediction there'd be a loyalty pledge required of candidates. trump has already said that whether he would back someone other than himself as the 2024 republican nominee would depend on who the candidate was. given that he is attacking his potential primary rivals, especially high-flying florida gov. ron desantis, the potential for new party splits is growing. ever since trump took control of the gop with his 2016 nomination and victory, the party has almost always capitulated to his unruly instincts and crushing of rules and conventions -- most notoriously appeasing his extremism during two impeachments. many gop lawmakers amplified his false claims of electoral fraud in the 2020 presidential election and whitewashed his role in the january 6, 2021, insurrection. yet trump's intervention in last year's midterm elections, when many of his election-denying acolytes lost in swing states and helped to quell a republican red wave, highlighted how his own priorities may diverge from his party's. some republican leaders blame trump and the way he alienates more moderate, suburban voters for the party's disappointing performances when they lost the house in 2018, the senate and white house in 2020 and fell short of expectations in 2022, even though they flipped the house. as a result, some top gop donors and opinion formers have argued that it's time for the party to move on from a candidate who is radioactive with many voters and who could thwart their chances of defeating president joe biden in an expected reelection bid. it remains to be seen if this view is shared among trump's longtime base. questions about whether trump would support desantis as nominee -- or anyone else who might beat him -- stemmed from a radio interview with hugh hewitt earlier this month. ""it would depend. i would give you the same answer i gave in 2016 during the debate. ... it would have to depend on who the nominee was,"" trump said. it would be a nightmare scenario for the gop if trump were to lose the party's nominating contest next year but spend the general election railing against the party's presidential pick. even small defections among trump's devoted grassroots political base could be critical in the kind of swing state races that decided the last two presidential elections. trump rarely plays by the rules trump acts as if he is entitled to his third consecutive spot at the top of the republican party's presidential ticket. but that assumption will face a new test this week when desantis, whom trump has already accused of disloyalty for considering a white house run, promotes and releases a new book in a rite of passage for potential presidential candidates. trump has also lashed out at nikki haley, who served as his ambassador to the united nations and has launched a 2024 bid rooted in calls for a new generation of american political leadership. both trump and haley are scheduled to speak at this week's conservative political action conference outside washington, dc. desantis, meanwhile, is scheduled to attend events in texas and california. while requiring debate candidates to sign a pledge to support the nominee would be a show of party unity and would, in effect, be an attempt to box trump in, it would hardly be enforceable should the ex-president not win the nomination. given that trump already falsely claimed the 2020 general election, which he lost fair and square, was marred by voter fraud, it's hardly far-fetched to believe he may trash any nomination process that he doesn't win. but mcdaniel said on cnn that she was sure that all the candidates would sign such a pledge, noting trump had signed on in the 2016 race and raising the leverage that the party has in getting all of the candidates on board. ""i think they all want to be on the debate stage. i think president trump would like to be on the debate stage. that's what he likes to do,"" mcdaniel told bash. the rnc head, who just won her own contested reelection, also warned that the gop has lost big races in the midterms ""because of republicans refusing to support other republicans. and unless we fix this in our party, unless we start coming together, we will not win in 2024."" mcdaniel may also have a problem beyond trump, since some possible gop 2024 contenders have warned that following his role in inciting a mob attack on congress in one of the most damaging blows to us democracy in modern times, the ex-president is no longer fit to carry the party's banner or for the presidency. former arkansas gov. asa hutchinson said on cbs this month that trump had ""disqualified himself and should not serve our country again as a result of what happened"" on january 6, 2021. but hutchinson did not say whether he would decline to endorse trump if he were the nominee. another possible anti-trump candidate, former maryland gov. larry hogan, suggested to hewitt this month that he would support the ex-president if he was the party's nominee but later said on twitter, ""trump won't commit to supporting the republican nominee, and i won't commit to supporting him."" signs of vulnerability in trump's campaign one reason why the question of whether trump would endorse a nominee other than himself in 2024 is so topical is because of some early signs that the former president might not have quite the hold on his party as he once did. his campaign hasn't exactly caught fire since he launched it last fall. some recent polls, while too far out from primary voting to be decisive, suggest that desantis is closely matched with trump -- even if other candidates like haley and potential candidates like ex-vice president mike pence trail in single figures. after his bumper reelection win in florida in november, desantis is seen by some party figures as representative of trump's populist, cultural and ""america first"" principles without the indiscipline and scandal that follows the ex-president. the florida governor has adopted trump's pugilistic partisan style, telling fox news host mark levin on sunday that he had made ""the democratic party in our state, basically, a rotten carcass on the side of the street."" it remains a question, however, how desantis would stand up to trump's searing attacks on a debate stage. and many once vaunted candidates -- like former govs. jeb bush of florida and scott walker of wisconsin -- have looked strong in theory, only to see their campaigns flame out when they hit the trail. still, mcdaniel's message on sunday shows the depth of party concern that an untamed trump could again severely impair the republican party's hopes of winning the white house and control of congress.",29.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.5750117544727079,0.2511525870670147,0.17383565455835698,-0.42843261233549146,0,0,0,0,-12.424545757729252,-11.830423929153778,34.0,-0.3479536449751111
RNC chair says requiring loyalty pledge for participation in GOP presidential debates is a 'no-brainer',2023-02-26,46.0,"republican national committee chairwoman ronna mcdaniel said sunday that she expects 2024 gop presidential contenders will have to sign a pledge to back the party's ultimate nominee in order to participate in primary debates. ""we haven't put the criteria out, but i expect a pledge will be part of it. it was part of 2016. i think it's kind of a no-brainer, right? if you're going to be on the republican national committee debate stage asking voters to support you, you should say, 'i'm going to support the voters and who they choose as the nominee,'"" mcdaniel told cnn's dana bash on ""state of the union"" in her first interview since winning a contentious race for a fourth term as rnc chairwoman. ""as rnc chair, if i said i wouldn't support the republican nominee, i would be removed from office,"" she said. asked if there would be other requirements for candidates to get onto the debate stage, mcdaniel said, ""i think there should be a threshold."" ""you want to make sure you have people on the debate stage who are running for president. we don't want people who are running for book deals, or media contracts, or cabinet positions,"" she said. republicans who have launched presidential bids include former president donald trump, former us ambassador to the united nations nikki haley and entrepreneur vivek ramaswamy, but many more are signaling interest. among them are florida gov. ron desantis, former vice president mike pence, and mike pompeo, trump's former secretary of state. a trump campaign spokesperson told cnn later sunday in response to mcdaniel's pledge expectation that ""president trump will support the republican nominee because it will be him."" earlier this month, trump hesitated when asked if he would support the eventual gop nominee if it were not him. ""it would depend,"" the former president told conservative radio host hugh hewitt during an interview on radio show. ""it would have to depend on who the nominee was."" desantis called for ""some new blood in the rnc"" prior to mcdaniel's win in january, while offering praise for harmeet dhillon, one of her opponents for the chair position. asked by bash if she had spoken to the florida governor since then, mcdaniel said, ""ron and i have a good relationship. and we're going to work well together,"" adding that she campaigned with desantis' wife, casey, ""quite a bit"" in the last election. the primary is still in its early stages, and it could take months before the field fully rounds into form and candidates make more than occasional visits to states such as iowa, new hampshire and south carolina, which will kick off the gop's nominating process. ""we can't be attacking each other so much that we lose sight of: we have to beat the democrats. we have to beat joe biden in 2024. and we may have divisive primaries and differences of opinions, but in the end we have to settle those to win the big picture, which is governing our country and doing right by the american people,"" mcdaniel said sunday, leaning on the message of unity she put forward in her campaign for another term atop the rnc. asked sunday about compelling certain white house hopefuls who have broken with party leaders -- such as former arkansas gov. asa hutchinson -- to sign a loyalty pledge, mcdaniel offered: ""i think you support the voters."" ""i am mitt romney's niece and i was appointed to the rnc by donald trump. and i would support both of them ... if they were the nominee of our party over joe biden. but i don't know if they would support each other,"" she said. mcdaniel was also asked about the decision by republicans in her home state of michigan to choose kristina karamo as state party chair. karamo has falsely claimed that trump won the state in the 2020 election, and she has yet to concede her loss in last year's race for michigan secretary of state. ""i don't know her very well. and i wasn't at this recent convention,"" said mcdaniel, herself a former michigan gop chair. ""but i'm committed to michigan. it's my state."" ""we have a senate seat. we have house seats. i love our great state. and the rnc is absolutely committed to michigan,"" she said. this story has been updated with additional reaction.

Opinion: Tim Scott's pitch to Republicans offers more than the usual red meat,2023-02-26,47.0,"don't underestimate tim scott. this week, the south carolina republican senator embarked on the obligatory iowa listening tour that precedes a possible presidential campaign. he offered up a well-scripted speech in des moines and then led the polk county lincoln day dinner, testing out the themes that could define a candidacy. if you glanced at the headlines, you might think that he was selling a warmed over form of trump's ""combative vision,"" served with a side order of desantis' bitter culture war assaults. that would be a mistake. because if you actually listened to scott's speeches, you'd hear a very different pitch to voters. ""for america to be at our best, we have to work together,"" scott said. ""we must come together on a common ground, built on common sense."" yes, tim scott is an unapologetic conservative. he is a person whose religious faith genuinely defines his personal journey and his politics. that may or may not be your policy preference. but his vision is fundamentally optimistic, a rebuke to grievance politics on the left and (implicitly) the right. he is not fanning the flames of fear about ""american carnage."" he is not wielding the american flag as a weapon to bludgeon people who look different than him. amid a wave of strategically induced crt panic, he is also not trying to whitewash american history to pretend it is an unadulterated story of perfection. at the lincoln day dinner, he told the story of how his beloved grandfather, born in 1921, was taught to step aside on the sidewalk to let a white man pass and never make eye contact. this was deep in the jim crow south. ""so when i talk about our history, i'm not whitewashing it,"" scott said. but he added that his grandfather told him ""you can be bitter -- or you can be better. i chose better."" as the only black republican senator, scott sees his remarkable rise as evidence of american exceptionalism and our success in forming a more perfect union. and as inherently unique as it is, scott's story is not one that can simply be dismissed out of hand. but he is ready to have his patriotism attacked.

Opinion: The message Biden sent to Putin,2023-02-26,48.0,"in april 1917, an impatient revolutionary leader stepped onto a train in zurich, beginning an 8-day journey home to st. petersburg. vladimir lenin couldn't wait to intervene in the turmoil that followed the abdication of russia's tsar nicholas ii. german authorities were happy to let the train carry lenin and his supporters through their nation, hoping the revolutionaries would further destabilize the shaky government of their wartime enemy. and they did. last weekend, a president of the united states secretly boarded a european train and made history of a different kind -- aiming to inspire. and he did. joe biden, the onetime amtrak commuter who now mostly travels by plane and helicopter, embarked from a station in eastern poland for the nearly 10-hour trip to kyiv, seated in a rail car paneled in dark wood. there he met with president volodymyr zelensky, and proclaimed that despite russia's invasion last feb. 24, ""one year later, kyiv stands. and ukraine stands. democracy stands."" as frida ghitis wrote, ""the risky trip on monday to an active war zone was not just a powerful symbol of american support, it was a shot in the arm to a population that has endured russia's devastating attacks on civilian apartment blocks, hospitals, schools and the power stations that provide heat and electricity."" ""who could have imagined in 2022, when ukraine's situation looked so hopeless that the united states offered to evacuate zelensky -- and he famously refused -- that a year later the ukrainian people would have put up such a strong resistance, and the west would have given so much support for their efforts? and that instead of (russian president vladimir) putin having a military parade in kyiv, it would be biden walking in the ukrainian capital's streets, arriving at the ornate mariinsky palace, the official residence of the ukrainian president?"" in the conservative national review, mark antonio wright observed, ""this trip took guts...the moment reminds me not so much of presidents bush, obama, and trump flying unannounced to iraq or afghanistan, but of president roosevelt's wartime travels across the atlantic. make no mistake, there was risk involved in this trip. traveling to the capital of a nation fighting a shooting war with a great power, the u.s. had no way to choreograph with exactitude the circumstances of his travel or arrival. neither the u.s. nor ukraine has total control of the airspace. neither the u.s. nor ukraine could guarantee biden's security on the ground."" jill filipovic observed that ""a year into putin's war, it's clear that he is willing to sacrifice untold lives to cement his power and russia's imperial interests."" she pointed out the russian president's effort to ally with culture warriors by attacking the west's openness to same-sex marriage, among other progressive values. ""americans have a choice, both at home and abroad: do we stand with autocrats and their small, hateful view of the world? or do we stand for freedom and democracy -- including the obligation to live among those whose views you don't agree with and whose choices you wouldn't make yourself?"" ""the decision, and the stakes, couldn't be clearer,"" filipovic wrote. ohio's train biden's critics cited another train -- the one that derailed feb. 3 in east palestine, ohio -- to try to take the shine off his historic trip. the derailment led to the release and burning of vinyl chloride and stirred fears among residents that their health and community were being endangered. ""three weeks after the derailment of a freight train carrying hazardous chemical ignited a days-long fire in their town, residents of east palestine are still waiting for answers,"" wrote ericka l. copeland, the chapter director of sierra club ohio. ""the concerns of environmental groups like ours are focused on the ongoing impacts to the east palestine community, where people continue to report odors and immediate health problems, chemical residues remain on soils and surfaces, and clean-up and soil removal is ongoing."" a federal regulator called the derailment ""100% preventable."" former president donald trump visited the site wednesday and said, ""you have a president going to ukraine and you have people in ohio that are in desperate need of help."" the former president didn't mention his own administration's deregulation efforts, including dropping a rail safety rule instituted by the obama administration, although experts said it probably wouldn't have applied to the derailment. transportation secretary pete buttigieg, who went to east palestine thursday, said he regretted not speaking out sooner on the derailment. julian zelizer wrote that ""the president needs to reassure the residents of east palestine and make sure that the town has all the resources it needs for a comprehensive cleanup while calling for the establishment of safety regulations that can diminish the chances of this kind of accident from happening again."" still, he noted, the president ""has plenty to work with to dispute the kind of claims being leveled by a republican party that has focused much more on supply side tax cuts, deregulation, and culture wars than on addressing the kind of crucial issues to emerge through the situation in east palestine."" flying with kids when kara alaimo and her husband traveled with their three-year-old on a quick trip to florida last month, they left their one-year-old child home with extended family. ""travel is such a nightmare that we thought she'd be happier not coming along,"" alaimo wrote. so alaimo was pleased to hear that united airlines will now allow families booking basic economy tickets to snag adjacent seats without additional fees for traveling together. ""united has said it will roll out more family-friendly features this year,"" wrote kara alaimo. ""that's good to hear, because we really need them...if airlines want to incentivize more families with young kids to travel, they need to make it a whole lot less difficult."" fast cars paul hockenos, a us native living in germany, says he's not a slow driver but ""it's utterly disconcerting when, ticking along at a brisk 75 miles per hour, somebody blows by me on the left and then disappears over the horizon as if i were driving a lawnmower."" germany's 7,200-mile autobahn network is famous for its long stretches without any speed limit, but now there are questions about whether to invest in it further. hockenos wrote that the nation's ""transportation sector's carbon emissions, say experts, are attributable overwhelmingly to cars and trucks -- and the higher the speed of a car, the greater the emissions..."" the ""burning question in germany at the moment is whether tens of billions of euros earmarked for new and broader autobahn wouldn't do more good building out cycling highways, like in the netherlands, or an improved high-speed, densely networked rail service."" ""ultimately, the proclivities of the car zealots have no place in the 21st century when we're racing against the clock to decarbonize our economies."" protecting children online pressure is building on congress to protect children online. patrick t. brown cited concern about a whistleblower's release of documents indicating that instagram's data ""showed the site made 'body image issues worse for 1 in 3 teen girls,' and also led to more severe and self-destructive thoughts."" ""while the company disputed the claims, it also postponed an 'instagram for kids' offering. cyberbullying and non-consensual nude photo sharing have plagued high schools."" the kids online safety act (kosa), which has bipartisan support, ""would require social media sites to default minors into the strongest possible privacy protections and give parents new tools to monitor harmful content. it would mandate social media platforms mitigate harms to minors, such as by restricting or eliminating content relating to self-harm, suicide and eating disorders. and it would set up require an annual audit of risks to minors, including providing broader data access to researchers to study the impact of social media on kids' development,"" brown wrote. meanwhile, supreme court justices admitted their confusion about key aspects of the online world last week. ""i mean, we're a court,"" said justice elena kagan. ""we really don't know about these things. you know, these are not like the nine greatest experts on the internet."" they were trying to make sense of the legal status of section 230 of the communications decency act of 1996, which shields platforms like google from liability for the content of their sites. the family of nohemi gonzalez, a 23-year-old student from california killed by isis terrorists in a paris bistro in 2015, argues that youtube, owned by google, should be held legally responsible for its algorithm allegedly promoting terrorist videos online. social media companies, marc ginsberg wrote, ""must be held to account for failing to quickly deploy the resources and technology to prevent extremist content from inciting violence despite earning a financial bonanza across their platforms. section 230 has shielded their need to make that investment."" grand juror's moment emily kohrs, the 30-year-old who was chosen foreperson of the special grand jury investigating claims of voter fraud in georgia in the 2020 election, rose from obscurity to media stardom within a few days. kohrs spoke guardedly to major media outlets about the grand jury's findings, including some of the witnesses and evidence. it is rare to hear publicly from someone in that role, particularly before a case is concluded. ""kohrs won't win any prizes for grand jury foreperson etiquette. her display has been unseemly, to say the least,"" wrote norm eisen and fred wertheimer. ""it has violated good taste -- but not the law..."" ""there is no hint in her remarks of special grand jurors being pressured to decide in one way or another,"" they observed. ""the da may now seek indictments from a regular grand jury that may have read or seen kohrs' remarks -- but those grand jurors almost certainly have her actual report, so whatever hints kohrs has dropped are hardly news to them. any potential targets might argue the statements will influence the trial jurors, but that can be dealt with during jury selection by asking prospective jurors if they heard the statements and were affected by them."" one year later oleksandra matviichuk documents the horrors of the ukraine war in her role as head of the center for civil liberties, a winner of the nobel peace prize last year.

Ron DeSantis wanted to send weapons to Ukraine when he was a congressman -- as a presidential hopeful he questions US involvement,2023-02-26,49.0,"florida gov. ron desantis once strongly supported arming ukraine to fight russia, urging then-president barack obama to do so as a deterrent to russian aggression in eastern europe -- a position at odds with his statements this week questioning the united states' involvement in the conflict. as a conservative congressman, desantis, now a potential presidential hopeful, urged sending ""defensive and offensive"" weapons to ukraine in 2014 and 2015 and even voted to refuse to fund a new missile defense treaty with russia until they withdrew from ukraine, according to a review of desantis' past comments by cnn's kfile. once an advocate of a hardline, hawkish approach to russia by supporting ukraine, the florida governor shifted course this week in anticipation of a potential presidential run in a changed, more isolationist republican party, questioning whether it was in the united states' interest to be involved in what he called, ""things like the borderlands or over crimea."" he added that russia was not ""the same threat to our country, even though they're hostile"" and downplayed the threats that russia could invade nato countries. desantis' foreign policy pivot from being a self-described follower of the ""reagan school"" of foreign policy to a more trumpian worldview comes as the republican party's voting base has grown increasingly isolationist. a recent poll from pew research center shows 40% of republican and republican-leaning independent voters now believe the us is providing too much support for ukraine, up from 9% last year. a cnn kfile review of desantis' past comments and actions found that desantis consistently supported sending aid to ukraine and condemned the russian annexation of crimea in 2014 and 2015 and as late as 2017. in a previously unreported interview with conservative talk radio host bill bennett in june 2015, desantis said he supported providing arms to ukraine and nato neighboring countries after russia annexed crimea in 2014 and criticized the obama administration for not doing so. ""we in the congress have been urging the president, i've been, to provide arms to ukraine. they want to fight their good fight. they're not asking us to fight it for them. and the president has steadfastly refused. and i think that that's a mistake,"" said desantis. ""i think that when someone like [russian president vladimir] putin sees obama being indecisive, i think that whets his appetite to create more trouble in the area. and i think if we were to arm the ukrainians, i think that would send a strong signal to him that he shouldn't be going any further,"" he added. in an interview from december 2017, desantis continued to align himself with the ""reagan school that's tough on russia,"" criticizing democrats for not supporting sending aid to ukraine. ""a couple years ago, obama was refusing to provide lethal aid to ukraine, they were trying to do a reset. the democrats lauded that,"" said desantis on fox news. ""they viewed guys like me who are -- who are more of the reagan school that's tough on russia as kind of throwbacks to the cold war. they criticized mitt romney in 2012. now all of a sudden because they're using it against trump, they're so concerned about russia."" desantis supported ukraine after russia illegally annexed crimea in 2014 in february and march of 2014, russia invaded the peninsula crimea in ukraine and occupied the territory, illegally annexing it and declaring it as a part of russia, an act that us and european allies decried and punished. as a freshman congressman serving on the house foreign affairs committee at the time, desantis voted for a resolution calling on russia to withdraw its forces from ukraine and voted on legislation authorizing $68 million in aid to ukraine and codifying sanctions on russia, which later passed in the house and a similar bill was later signed by obama. he also voted to sanction russian and ukrainian officials involved in the annexation as well as provide economic assistance to ukrainians. in may 2015, desantis voted for an amendment in the defense spending bill that would bar funds to implement the start treaty, a nuclear deterrent treaty between the us and russia, until then-president obama certified russian forces were no longer illegally occupying ukrainian territory. the house approved the amendment, congress passed the legislation, but obama vetoed the bill. desantis also co-sponsored a resolution in 2015 supporting free elections without russian interference in ukraine, a direct response to the crimea referendum desantis once referred to as a ""obviously a farce."" while desantis strongly rebuked russian aggression, he did not advocate for military intervention, noting in 2014 that us military options were ""definitely limited."" ""we have common cause with those folks,"" he said in march 2014, referring to ukrainians who protested the annexation, ""but it's just a type of situation where militarily, we don't really have any, any options to do much. so, i don't know if ukraine as a whole is written off, but i don't see us doing very much to reunify crimea with ukraine."" desantis argued in an interview with fox news in may 2015 that putin ""knows he can get away with things there. and i think if we had a policy which was firm, which armed ukraine with defensive and offensive weapons so that they could defend themselves, i think putin would make different calculations."" he continued, ""and so i think obama's policy of weakness is actually making a larger conflict more likely. and i think if you had reagan's policy of strength, i think you'd see people like putin not wanna mess with us."" after the ukraine-russia war broke out in february 2022 following russia's initial invasion in february 2022, desantis remained quiet on the issue until he criticized the biden administration's response and blamed the invasion on president joe biden, citing the afghanistan withdrawal. ""my feeling is that they haven't done enough, europe or biden's administration, to really hit putin where it counts,"" he said in a february 2022 news conference, emphasizing the russian economy's reliance on oil and gas exports. he also expressed support for ukrainians, saying ""i was heartened to see them having some moxie to fight back."" ""and let me tell you, if you go into another country with an armed population that is hell bent on resisting you, i mean, it's gonna be death by a thousand cuts for the russian army,"" desantis added. days later, desantis said in a news conference, ""i think that putin would probably not have done this if he thought the united states was strong, but i think he thinks that the united states is weak because of the impotence of biden's administration."" desantis also highlighted his previous support for ukraine in a different news conference, pointing to weapons for ukraine funded during the trump administration.

Media organizations ask Congress for access to January 6 footage,2023-02-25,50.0,"cnn, along with a group of other media organizations, has signed on to a letter calling for congressional leaders to grant access to security footage from inside the us capitol on january 6, 2021, after house speaker kevin mccarthy gave fox news' tucker carlson access to the material earlier this month. in a friday letter on behalf of the press coalition to mccarthy, house majority leader steve scalise, house minority leader hakeem jeffries, senate majority leader chuck schumer and senate minority leader mitch mcconnell, attorney charles tobin called on congress to release all the security footage showing the attack on the capitol. ""without full public access to the complete historical record, there is concern that an ideologically-based narrative of an already polarizing event will take hold in the public consciousness, with destabilizing risks to the legitimacy of congress, the capitol police, and the various federal investigations and prosecutions of january 6 crimes,"" tobin said in the letter. advance publications, abc news, axios, cbs news, scripps, gannett, the los angeles times, politico and propublica are the other media organizations joining cnn on the letter. the request comes after carlson announced on his show that he had been granted ""unfettered"" access to ""44,000 hours"" of surveillance footage from inside the capitol on january 6. cnn previously reported that mccarthy did not consult with his house gop leadership team or with jeffries before deciding to give carlson access. in an interview with the new york times on wednesday, mccarthy justified the decision by saying, ""i promised."" ""i was asked in the press about these tapes, and i said they do belong to the american public. i think sunshine lets everybody make their own judgment,"" the california republican told the times. mccarthy has faced significant pressure from his right flank to relitigate the work of the house select committee that investigated the january 6, 2021, insurrection. the now-defunct january 6 panel got access to all the security footage from us capitol police during its investigation, but it did not release some footage for security reasons. a source familiar with the committee's work told cnn that the unreleased footage was considered sensitive material because it showed top officials moving through the us capitol when they evacuated to safety. during his bid for the speakership, mccarthy vowed to hold hearings on the security failures that led to the capitol getting overrun, and he told the select committee to preserve all of its records for potential future review by the newly empowered gop majority. carlson has been a prominent promoter of january 6 conspiracy theories and has devoted significant airtime to boosting false claims that liberal ""deep state"" partisans within the fbi orchestrated the insurrection as a way to undermine former president donald trump. some republican lawmakers had hoped to review the material themselves, likely to look for footage to support their controversial claims about the january 6 attack. democrats have criticized mccarthy's decision to give carlson access to the security footage. jeffries said in a letter to colleagues that the move ""represents an egregious security breach that endangers the hardworking women and men of the united states capitol police, who valiantly defended our democracy with their lives at risk on that fateful day."" schumer told his senate colleagues in a letter that the disclosure ""poses grave security risks to members of congress and everyone who works on capitol hill.""

DeSantis has a new book coming out next week. Here's what his first one said,2023-02-25,51.0,"florida gov. ron desantis on tuesday will release his book, ""the courage to be free,"" to much anticipation ahead of his expected plunge into the 2024 presidential race. but it's not the first time desantis has dabbled in authorship to jumpstart his political ambitions. as a little-known navy prosecutor on the cusp of a bid for a jacksonville-area congressional seat, desantis in 2011 released the audaciously titled ""dreams from our founding fathers."" he has joked that the book -- from an obscure publisher that mostly dealt in children's titles and a thriller series produced by a middle school principal -- received little acclaim and was ""read by about a dozen people."" unlike most entries in the political genre, it's not a memoir and its autobiographical content is sparse. rather, it's a lengthy critique of barack obama's political ascent and presidency, affixed on the hypothesis that the policies and philosophies of the country's first black executive diverged dramatically from the ""enduring truths that the constitution's creators relied upon when they framed america's foundational document."" it litigates the case by contrasting the then-president's beliefs and background (pulling often from the democrat's own best-selling 1995 autobiography, ""dreams from my father"") with the writings of the founding fathers. it's an instructive window into desantis' governing beliefs, which at times seem to collide with his current leadership style but may soon inform his platform as he seeks higher office. it shows the early seeds of his disdain for the media, strongly suggests christianity is foundational to the constitution and demonstrates his early willingness to buck establishment forces in his own party. as was the time, the book also serves as a full-throated defense of the tea party movement while eviscerating the affordable care act, the healthcare law signed by obama that provoked republicans across the country -- including desantis -- to run for office. but it also makes historical arguments for the preservation of slavery and touches on obama's roots and muslim outreach in ways that democrats have already amplified ahead of desantis' expected run for president. here are four takeaways from the book. using the founding fathers and the federalist papers as a guide desantis' views on the country's founding document and the reach of the federal government is informed heavily by the federalist papers, the essays produced by alexander hamilton, james madison and john jay to persuade new york to ratify the us constitution. desantis writes that these essays represent ""the single best source for the exposition of the principles underlying the constitution of the united states of america."" it's these writings that often buttress desantis' criticisms of obama and his insistence that the democrat's vision of america is antithetical to its foundational document. to desantis, the very notion of a ""transformative"" presidency flies in the face of the static role of the executive envisioned by the framers. (the word ""transform"" appears 75 times throughout the short work.) in his book, desantis argued that the constitution's creators expected representatives to be responsive -- though not beholden -- to public opinion, especially when pursuing far-reaching pieces of legislation. as it is, desantis said, obama and his allies should have looked at the decades of opposition to health care reform as a sign not to mess with it. desantis as governor, though, has often eschewed public opinion when taking actions and has proudly declared, ""i'm not going to lead based on polls."" for example, desantis signed the most restrictive abortion law in florida's modern history despite consistent support for making the procedure accessible to women. it's not the only inconsistent view on leadership between desantis the author and desantis the politician. desantis also took great umbrage at descriptions of obama ""casting his candidacy as one of singular historical significance and himself as a messianic figure."" but his own closing message to florida voters last fall came in a 90-second video that suggested he was made by god on the eighth day to be a ""fighter."" he also compared obama with george washington, who, desantis wrote, possessed ""a deep sense of humility, a humility that dovetailed superbly with the ethos of republican government."" and he noted that the founding fathers warned of a demagogue leader who ""capitalizes on popular prejudices by peddling false claims, by employing questionable rhetorical techniques, or by intentionally sowing divisions among different factions or interests within the body politic."" desantis as a republican primary candidate for governor in 2018 campaigned almost exclusively on his endorsement from then-president donald trump, who often peddled false claims and once claimed, ""i alone can fix it."" slavery as a necessary compromise desantis at one point accused obama of not paying fealty to the constitution with the same vigor as his predecessors and suggested it was because of obama's inability to look beyond the codification of slavery at the nation's birth. desantis wrote that after the 2010 midterms, ""a noticeably agitated obama even declared, 'i couldn't go through the front door at this country's founding' "" -- an opinion desantis called ""seriously flawed."" desantis throughout the book is dismissive of criticism that the founding fathers are tainted by their failure to end the enslavement of black americans, and he described the preservation of slavery and the three-fifths compromise as necessary to ensure the passage of the constitution -- ""a view shared by strongly anti-slavery delegates like alexander hamilton and benjamin franklin,"" he wrote. ""slavery had been a fact of life throughout human history, and had existed in britain's american colonies for 150 years before the convention at philadelphia in 1787. in certain southern states, slave labor was the backbone of the entire economy, and immediately abolishing slavery would have represented an enlightened but also a monumental change -- a revolution far more socially, politically and economically momentous than the american revolution itself,"" desantis wrote. ""this is why there was no real chance that the convention would abolish the peculiar institution of slavery."" more recently, desantis has contended that the american revolution itself ""caused people to question slavery"" and birthed abolition movements. ""no one had questioned it before we decided as americans that we are endowed by our creator with inalienable rights,"" desantis said last year. desantis went on to argue in his book that obama's views were more closely aligned with the slavery defender sen. stephen a. douglas, who lost the 1860 presidential election to abraham lincoln, than the great emancipator. ""though obama made every attempt to draw comparisons between himself and lincoln, it is actually one of lincoln's foremost political adversaries and one of obama's predecessors, stephen a. douglas, who argued like obama that the founders meant to exclude non-whites from the natural rights clarion call contained in the declaration of independence."" desantis would use this rhetorical trick again in the book to accuse obama of ascribing to ""the same doctrine that chief justice taney invoked in dred scott"" -- the supreme court case that found enslaved african americans could not claim citizenship and didn't enjoy the rights ascribed by the constitution. this criticism of slavery's perversions clouding constitutional judgment extended to supreme court justice thurgood marshall, the country's first black justice, desantis contended. desantis took issue with marshall's criticism of the framers on the grounds that ""the government they devised was defective from the start."" desantis wrote: ""such criticism misses the mark."" a time capsule to the affordable care act debate at the time desantis published his book, few topics animated voters like the 2010 passage of obama's signature domestic achievement, the affordable care act. desantis accused the law's champions of putting ""america on a course to a government-run, single-payer system"" -- a warning that has yet to materialize, though several democratic candidates for president ran on such a policy during the 2020 election. desantis' opposition to ""obamacare"" isn't surprising on its face. as a lawmaker, he voted often with his republican colleagues to repeal the affordable care act and he was a founding member of the freedom caucus, which helped orchestrate a federal government shutdown aimed at defunding the law. but unlike some republicans, who at times voiced support for the law's more popular provisions (like the requirement for insurance to cover children until age 26), desantis' opposition appeared wholesale. ""initially justified by obama as a needed remedy for the problem of rising health care costs that hurt members of the middle class, the post-passage euphoria revealed a different, more controversial justification for a federal overhaul of the health care system: the redistribution of wealth,"" desantis wrote. even the requirement for insurance companies to cover adults and children with pre-existing conditions appeared problematic to desantis because it could lead to higher insurance costs. ""though this sounded noble, the law had the effect of undermining insurance coverage for children,"" desantis contended. ""by mandating that insurers take on more risk than is economically justifiable, obamacare forced insurers either to absorb financial losses or else increase premiums for all policies."" can desantis match his goal posts? desantis in his book laid out a blueprint for leadership that is rigidly confined to a strict reading of the constitution and adherence to ""fundamental law with stable meaning."" this includes limitations on the executive branch's abilities and a rigorous adherence to separation of powers. as governor, desantis has at times flouted seemingly similar constraints on executive power that he often charged obama with crossing in his book. for example, he accused obama's then-health and human services secretary, kathleen sebelius, of using ""her power to intimidate private businesses for engaging in speech she didn't like. this illustrates the progressive impulse to centralize authority in bureaucratic arrangements at its apogee."" but as governor, desantis issued an eerily similar warning to businesses not to get in his way, or else. ""if you are in one of these corporations, if you're a woke ceo, you want to get involved in our legislative business, look, it's a free country,"" desantis said in 2021. ""but understand, if you do that, i'm fighting back against you. and i'm going to make sure that people understand your business practices, and anything i don't like about what you're doing."" it's a lesson disney certainly learned.",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.9664267301559448,0.02580484189093113,0.007768441457301378,-1.0,0,0,0,0,-1.0,-9.83393305392261,13.0,-0.7564563887632777

""rep. perry's communications with executive branch officials, as reflected in the responsive records, demonstrate that he welcomed, rather than resisted, and indeed often initiated these communication [redacted],"" chief judge beryl howell of the dc district court wrote in one of four unsealed opinions, after she had reviewed the records and decided to release them to prosecutors. around the 2020 election, the pennsylvania lawmaker had been in touch with president donald trump and powerful trump backers, including white house chief of staff mark meadows, justice department official jeffrey clark and others who pushed false claims of election fraud. his communications with the executive branch, she wrote, were ""proactive, persistent and protracted."" the newly available court records provide more insight into the scope of the ongoing fight over perry's phone, which is part of special counsel jack smith's criminal investigation around january 6, 2021. in total, howell on friday unsealed four opinions with redactions that she wrote related to the justice department's ability to access more than 2,200 records on the congressman's cell phone, after the fbi seized the device last year. howell also called perry's phone compendium a ""multi-pronged push for executive branch officials to take more aggressive action,"" likely in response to suspicions of election fraud, and deemed those cell phone records not covered by congressional protection. in another part of her rulings, howell wrote how perry's communications with private individuals shouldn't stay secret from investigators, either -- including almost 700 records showing his interest in election security and electors as well as contact with trump campaign attorneys. ""what is plain is that the clause does not shield rep. perry's random musings with private individuals touting an expertise in cybersecurity or political discussions with attorneys from a presidential campaign, or with state legislators concerning hearings before them about possible local election fraud or actions they could take to challenge election results in pennsylvania,"" howell wrote. unsealings friday while howell ultimately let perry keep about 161 of his records from investigators under the constitution's speech or debate clause -- a provision that shields legislators from certain law enforcement actions targeting conduct related to their legislative duties -- she ordered that the 2,000 other records be given to justice department investigators. the inquiry is now part of special counsel smith's january 6 investigation. perry has appealed her ruling, managing to keep secret all 2,000 records for almost seven months since his phone's seizure, and the dc circuit court of appeals heard arguments in the case on thursday. because some of those arguments were public, howell released redacted versions of her opinions and orders in the case friday night. she largely rejected perry's arguments for privacy, calling his approach to the case an ""astonishing view of the scope of the legislative privilege"" that would ""truly cloak members of congress with a powerful dual non-disclosure and immunity shield for virtually any of their activities that could be deemed information gathering about any matter which might engage legislative attention."" 44 days the unsealed court orders also provided more insight into the search itself, and how the case came to be. after perry's phone was seized and copied by fbi agents on august 9, the justice department returned to court for a warrant to review the contents of his phone. nine days later, howell approved the warrant, ""finding probable cause that a crime was committed"" and that evidence of the crime would be found on perry's phone, according to the unsealed opinions. perry had 44 days to argue to the court his speech or debate privileges as a member of congress, which could protect records of legitimate legislative activity from the federal investigation. he told the court his phone contained ""communications with his staff, members of congress, and others"" -- then logged records on his phone, including ""notes,"" by date, recipient, sender and subject matter for a judge to consider. howell then went through those records. perry has not been charged with a crime. accusations of slow-walking howell last november showed concern that perry's team was trying to ""unilaterally delay"" the criminal investigation. the court fight itself has put on hold doj's ability to access the content of perry's phone. and, howell accused perry's team of slow-walking the work on the case, as their review of the contents of the phone last fall went slowly as the litigation moved forward. his team was reviewing his phone records for possible privilege assertions at a rate of 265 documents a day, the justice department told the judge, while the court had ordered them to review records at a rate of 800 a day, according to one of the opinions released friday. ""if rep. perry has indeed significantly deviated from the pace required under the perry privilege log order, and he continues to slow-walk producing privilege logs to the government ... he risks forfeiting his right to assert his privilege,"" she wrote in november. ""rep. perry is now on notice to speed up his review."" the timing of his documents review didn't arise again in howell's future opinions, according to the redacted now-released court records. this story has been updated with additional details.

A first report on the Ohio toxic train wreck was released. Here's what it found — and what investigators are still looking into,2023-02-24,53.0,"after federal officials released an initial report concluding that this month's toxic train wreck in ohio was completely preventable, investigators will begin examining procedures, practices and design prior to the derailment that has sparked long-term concerns among hundreds of frustrated residents. the national transportation safety board on thursday released its preliminary report on the investigation into the february 3 train crash in east palestine, ohio, where residents have been complaining about feeling sick after hazardous chemicals seeped into the air, water and soil. ohio environmental officials made a civil referral this week asking the state attorney general's office to begin ""legal and/or equitable civil actions"" against train operator norfolk southern, which could result in a civil complaint if negotiations with the company were to fail. the ntsb report found that one of the train's cars carrying plastic pellets was heated by a hot axle that sparked the initial fire, according to jennifer homendy, the chair of the safety board. as the temperature of the bearing got hotter, the train passed by two wayside defect detectors that did not trigger an audible alarm message because the heat threshold was not met at that point, homendy explained. a third detector eventually picked up the high temperature, but it was already too late by then. ""this was 100% preventable. ... there is no accident. every single event that we investigate is preventable,"" homendy said during a news conference thursday. ""the ntsb has one goal, and that is safety and ensuring that this never happens again."" the next phase of the investigation will examine the train's wheelset and bearing as well as the damage from the derailment, the ntsb report noted. the agency will also focus on the designs of tank cars and railcars along with maintenance procedures and practices. plus, investigators will review the train operator's use of wayside defect detectors and the company's railcar inspection practices. more specifically, determining what caused the wheel bearing failure will be key to the investigation, homendy said. 'this is not a time for politics,' ntsb chair says on friday, homendy said on ""cnn this morning"" that she's concerned politics could cloud the investigation and prevent safety improvements. former president donald trump visited the site of the train derailment on wednesday where he criticized president joe biden's administration's handling of the railway disaster. ""this is not a time for politics,"" homendy said. ""there is a time for politics. it is not this."" on thursday, transportation secretary pete buttigieg also visited the derailment site, and when asked how political figures like trump could help, buttigieg addressed the former president directly saying he could ""express support for reversing the deregulation that happened on his watch."" another key aspect of the investigation will focus on the response to the chemical disaster, particularly the manual detonations of tanks carrying toxic chemicals. five of the 38 derailed train cars were carrying more than 115,000 gallons of vinyl chloride, according to the ntsb's report. exposure to high levels of vinyl chloride can increase cancer risk or cause death. those five cars ""continued to concern authorities because the temperature inside one tank car was still rising,"" indicating a polymerization reaction which could have resulted in an explosion, the report said. to help prevent a potentially deadly blast of vinyl chloride, crews released the toxic chemical into a trench and burned it off on february 6 — three days after the derailment. since then, some east palestine residents have said they are experiencing headaches, dizziness, nausea and bloody noses — a host of health issues they say they did not have prior to the crash. at the same time, officials have been adamant in reassuring residents of the air's safety and the municipal water supply. 2 million gallons of firefighting water to be disposed of in texas around 2 million gallons of firefighting water from the train derailment site are expected to be disposed in harris county, texas, according to the county's chief executive. harris county judge lina hidalgo said her office was told by texas molecular on thursday that the shipments began arriving around last wednesday, she said. texas molecular was hired to dispose of the potentially dangerous water from the train derailment, the company, which said it has more than four decades of experience in managing water safely, has told cnn. the company told hidalgo's office thursday that half a million gallons were already in the county. hidalgo expressed frustration that she first learned about the water shipments from the news media -- not from a government agency or texas molecular. ""it's a very real problem we were told yesterday the materials were coming only to learn today they've been here for a week,"" hidalgo said. she added that although there's no legal requirement for her office to be notified, ""it doesn't quite seem right."" texas molecular is receiving the water from trucks, but it's unclear if trucks are used for the entire trip, hidalgo said. the company told her office they're receiving about 30 trucks of water a day, she said. cnn is seeking comment from texas molecular about how the water is being transported. hidalgo said her office is looking for information about the disposal, including the chemical composition of the firefighting water, the precautions that are being taken, and why harris county was the chosen site. ""there's nothing right now to tell me -- to tell us -- there's going to be an accident in transport, that this is being done in such a way that is not compatible with the well, that there's a nefarious reason why the water is coming here and not to a closer site,"" hidalgo said. ""but it is our job to do basic due diligence on that information."" a total of 1.7 million gallons of contaminated liquid have been removed from the immediate site of the derailment, according to a thursday news release from the ohio emergency management agency. more than 1.1 million gallons of ""contaminated liquid"" from east palestine have been transported off-site so far, with the majority going to texas molecular and the rest going to a facility in vickery, ohio. cnn has asked the ohio agency the location of the remaining 581,500 gallons, which have been ""removed"" but not ""hauled off-site."" michigan congresswoman says she was unaware contaminated soil was coming to her state congresswoman debbie dingell of michigan said she was ""not given a heads up"" that contaminated soil from east palestine would be transported to the us ecology wayne disposal in belleville, michigan. ""we were not given a heads up on this reported action,"" dingell said in a press release on friday, ""our priority is to always keep the people we represent safe."" dingell said inquires to the epa, department of transportation, norfolk southern, us ecology, the state of ohio and others involved are in the process. on friday afternoon, ohio gov. mike dewine released an update on the removal of the contaminated site in east palestine, saying that soil would be transported to michigan. so far, 4,832 cubic yards of soil have been removed from the ground in east palestine. approximately six truckloads of that contaminated soil are on their way to the hazardous waste disposal facility in michigan, according to a news release from dewine. evidence does not show wrongdoing from crew the 149-car train operated by norfolk southern on february 3 had three employees on board: a locomotive engineer, a conductor and a trainee who were all in the head end of the locomotive, homendy told cnn's jake tapper on thursday. so far, the investigation found the crew did not do anything wrong prior to the derailment, though the crash was ""100% preventable,"" homendy said. video of the train before the derailment showed what appeared to be an overheated wheel bearing, according to the ntsb report. footage showed sparks flying from underneath the train. ntsb investigators are now focusing on one train car's wheel set and bearing to figure out what may have caused the overheating, homendy said. ""we have a lot of questions about that,"" she said friday, including the ""thresholds and why they vary so much between railroads."" ultimately, it's the railroads that set the temperature thresholds for the detectors, homendy said. releasing publicly a probable cause or causes for the derailment could take 12 to 18 months, homendy said during the news conference. ""we are very deliberative. we are the gold standard when it comes to investigations globally, and we are methodical in our approach,"" homendy said. ""but if we see a safety issue that we need to be addressed immediately, something systemic, we will not hesitate to issue an urgent safety recommendation."" in the meantime, here's what the ntsb preliminary report found so far: one wheel bearing's temperature reached a ""critical"" level — 253 degrees fahrenheit above the ambient temperature — and prompted an audible alarm that instructed ""the crew to slow and stop the train to inspect a hot axle,"" the report says.the train's engineer applied the train's brakes and additional braking after the alert of an overheating axle, the report states. ""during this deceleration, the wheel bearing failed,"" homendy explained. ""car 23 derailed, and the train initiated an emergency brake application and came to a stop."" even after reading the preliminary ntsb report, ohio attorney general dave yost told ""cnn this morning"" that there's still a lot of facts he doesn't know. among his biggest questions are: ""had the train been shorter, had there been additional staff, could this have been averted? based on the alerts that occurred, how long is the reaction time and how is that influenced by the size of the train?"" yost told cnn. how officials have responded the us environmental protection agency has ordered norfolk southern to cover the full cost of cleaning up the aftermath of the train crash. ""epa has special authority for situations just like this where we can compel companies who inflict trauma and cause environmental and health damage to communities, like norfolk southern has done, to completely clean up the mess that they've caused and pay for it,"" epa administrator michael regan said. norfolk southern will be required to: provide a descriptive work plan on how they intend to clean up the water, soil and debrisreimburse the epa for providing residents a cleaning service of their homes and businessesshow up to public meetings and explain their progress if the company does not follow the order, the epa will step in to complete the duties, while fining norfolk southern up to $70,000 a day, regan said wednesday during a cnn town hall.

"Biden: 'At this point I'm not' planning to visit East Palestine, Ohio, after toxic train derailment",2023-02-25,54.0,"president joe biden told reporters at the white house friday he has no plans travel to east palestine, ohio, and defended his administration's response to the train derailment there that caused a toxic chemical spill. ""at this point, i'm not,"" biden said, when asked if he has any plans to visit the community, pointing instead to his and his administration's early and consistent response to the disaster. ""you know, we were there two hours after the train went down -- two hours,"" biden said. ""i've spoken with every single major figure in both pennsylvania and in ohio, and so the idea that we're not engaged is just simply not there. and initially, there was not a request for me to go out even before i was heading over to kyiv, so i'm keeping very close tabs on it. we're doing all we can."" biden, who was briefed friday on the latest developments, noted that he had held a ""long meeting with my team"" on zoom. following biden's comments, a white house official shared a detailed timeline outlining the federal government's response in the wake of the derailment, including the arrival of federal teams from the environmental protection agency, the department of transportation, the federal railroad administration, and the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration just two hours after norfolk southern reported the derailment to the national response center at 10:53 p.m. et on february 3. according to the timeline, the white house contacted ohio republican gov. mike dewine to offer additional federal assistance on february 5, with biden calling dewine and pennsylvania democratic gov. josh shapiro on february 6. ""federal teams have continued to arrive in east palestine -- investigating the cause of the derailment, making norfolk southern clean up its mess and reimburse families, conducting public health screenings, monitoring the air and water, and screening over 550 homes,"" the official told cnn. but the biden administration's response has drawn criticism from republicans, including east palestine mayor trent conaway, who told fox news earlier this week that biden's decision to visit ukraine while the situation was unfolding in ohio was ""the biggest slap in the face, that tells you right now he doesn't care about us."" in remarks from east palestine wednesday, former president donald trump slammed the biden administration's handling of the situation, telling supporters in ohio, ""you are not forgotten."" per the white house, biden made calls tuesday from warsaw, poland, to receive updates on the epa's response, including with pa administrator michael regan, ohio democratic sen. sherrod brown, ohio republican rep. bill johnson, dewine and shapiro. pressed on the administration's response, white house press secretary karine jean-pierre told reporters thursday, ""yes, he [biden] is satisfied"" at his administration's response, while touting agency work throughout the crisis. ""showing up is having the environmental protection administrator on the ground, showing up is having the dot secretary on the ground to talk about what is the next process, holding to account the account the company that caused the spill,"" she said, while criticizing ""bad faith attacks"" against members of biden's administration, including transportation secretary pete buttigieg.",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.11195732653141022,0.7794620394706726,0.10858065634965897,-0.008663887454350937,0,0,0,0,-0.008663887454350937,-2.4810390913464744,7.0,-0.3544341559066392
"12 blue states sue FDA, saying it's too strict in limiting abortion drugs as legal battle over mifepristone heats up",2023-02-25,55.0,"twelve states led by liberal attorneys general announced friday that they had sued the food and drug administration, saying its limits on mifepristone, one of the two drugs used for medication abortion, are too strict. the suit is a possible hedge by states waiting to see how a federal judge in texas rules in a lawsuit brought by anti-abortion groups seeking to block the fda's approval of mifepristone altogether. conflicting rulings could mean the supreme court is asked to sort out the issue. related: how a medication abortion, also known as an 'abortion pill,' works ""the federal government has known for years that mifepristone is safe and effective,"" washington state attorney general bob ferguson said in a statement. ""in the wake of the supreme court's radical decision overturning roe v. wade, the fda is now exposing doctors, pharmacists and patients to unnecessary risk. the fda's excessive restrictions on this important drug have no basis in medical science."" mifepristone was first approved in 2000 and medication abortion accounts for more than half of the abortions in the us. it is the first drug, followed by misoprostol, in the medication abortion regimen. patients and providers must sign agreements stating the drug will be used to end a pregnancy, and pharmacies must have special certification. the lawsuit was filed in federal court in the eastern district of washington state. the states in the lawsuit are: washington, oregon, arizona, colorado, connecticut, delaware, illinois, michigan, nevada, new mexico, rhode island and vermont. final brief filed in texas lawsuit a lawsuit seeking to block the use of medication abortion nationwide could receive an initial decision at any moment, after the plaintiffs in the case submitted to the court on friday their final brief on the challenge. the lawsuit, filed in november by anti-abortion advocates against fda, challenges the two-decade-old approval of mifepristone, the first drug in the medication abortion process. a decision by us district judge matthew kacsmaryk, an appointee of former president donald trump, in favor of the plaintiffs could have far-reaching consequences since medication abortion now makes up a majority of abortions obtained in the us. in the filing submitted friday, the anti-abortion advocates rehashed many of the arguments they made in earlier briefs. its submission means that kacsmaryk could soon rule on a motion by the plaintiffs to temporarily block use of the medication. the judge had previously said that once the february 24 filing deadline ended, ""briefing will then be closed on the matter, absent any 'exceptional or extraordinary circumstances.'"" kacsmaryk, however, could also call for a hearing, or ask for additional responses. the defendants in the case -- the fda and danco, which makes mifepristone -- argued in separate briefs to the court that a decision against the drug's approval would be unprecedented and would shutter the drugmaker's business. reproductive rights advocates have stressed that a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs would be devastating, with naral pro-choice america saying in a statement that if the drug is yanked from the market, ""64.5 million women of reproductive age in the us would lose access to medication abortion care, an exponential increase in harm overnight.""

Fulton County judge who oversaw special grand jury in Trump probe says jurors are free to discuss final report,2023-02-24,56.0,"the judge who oversaw a special grand jury investigating efforts by former president donald trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election in georgia says he instructed jurors they were prevented from discussing deliberations but did not face restrictions in talking about the panel's final report. ""the contents of the report are not deliberations,"" fulton county superior court judge robert mcburney told cnn. mcburney also said that the special grand jury, which has faced criticism from trump and his legal team, did its job consistent with the rules governing special grand juries in the state. ""they complied with their charter,"" he said. the judge has ordered the contents of the panel's final report, including recommendations about whether anyone should face indictments, to remain under seal. but he acknowledged that special grand jurors are not prevented from discussing their work product. ""what witnesses said, what you put in your report, those are not off-limits,"" he added. the report includes recommendations from the special grand jury about whether trump or any of his associates should face criminal charges. the panel's foreperson, emily kohrs, went on a media blitz this week, suggesting in interviews with cnn and other outlets that the special grand jury recommended more than a dozen indictments. mcburney declined to comment on whether he believed kohrs crossed a line about what special grand jurors were allowed to divulge during her media appearances. ""it's not for me to assess,"" the judge said. mcburney, who previously spoke with the atlanta journal-constitution about the instructions governing special grand jurors, elaborated on what constitutes deliberations. he noted that if a witness or prosecutor was present with the special grand jury, those discussions would be fair game for special grand jurors to discuss publicly. ""if someone is presenting or if a witness is testifying responding to questions from a prosecutor, or the district attorney is talking to the grand jury, that is not deliberations,"" mcburney said. while the special grand jury cannot issue indictments -- and ultimately it will be up to fulton county district attorney fani willis to determine if anyone should face charges -- kohrs' media tour set off some backlash about the process, particularly from trump's attorneys. ""what we have seen over the past 48-hours proves that whatever conclusions were drawn were not the result of an analytical, trustworthy, or credible investigation as one would expect in a matter of historic proportion such as this,"" trump attorneys drew findling, jennifer little and marissa goldberg said in a statement this week.",5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.6564311519265175,0.3263904392719269,0.01717840861529112,-0.7886672770091054,0,0,0,0,-3.9433363850455274,-4.413444159220169,11.0,-0.40122219629274264
"'It's a major blow': Dominion has uncovered 'smoking gun' evidence in case against Fox News, legal experts say",2023-02-24,57.0,"fox news is in serious hot water. that's what several legal experts told cnn this week following dominion voting systems explosive legal filing against the right-wing talk channel, revealing the network's executives and hosts privately blasted the election fraud claims being peddled by donald trump's team, despite allowing lies about the 2020 contest to be promoted on its air. while the legal experts cautioned that they would like to see fox news' formal legal response to the filing, they all indicated in no uncertain terms that the evidence compiled in dominion's legal filing represents a serious threat to the channel. ""it's a major blow,"" attorney floyd abrams of pentagon papers fame said, adding that the ""recent revelations certainly put fox in a more precarious situation"" in defending against the lawsuit on first amendment grounds. a version of this article first appeared in the ""reliable sources"" newsletter. sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. rebecca tushnet, the frank stanton professor of first amendment law at harvard law school, described dominion's evidence as a ""very strong"" filing that ""clearly lays out the difference between what fox was saying publicly and what top people at fox were privately admitting."" a cache of behind-the-scenes messages included in the legal filing showed fox corp chairman rupert murdoch called trump's claims ""really crazy stuff,"" and the cable network's stars — including tucker carlson, sean hannity, and laura ingraham — brutally mock the lies being pushed by the former president's camp asserting that the election was rigged. it also showed attempts to crack down on fact-checking election lies. on one occasion, carlson demanded that fox news white house correspondent jacqui heinrich be fired after she fact-checked a trump tweet pushing election fraud claims. tushnet said that in all of her years practicing and teaching law, she had never seen such damning evidence collected in the pre-trial phase of a defamation suit. ""i don't recall anything comparable to this,"" tushnet said. ""donald trump seems to be very good at generating unprecedented situations."" david korzenik, an attorney who teaches first amendment law and represents a number of media organizations, said that the filing showed dominion's case against fox news has serious teeth. korzenik stressed that while the law allows for bias and ratings-seeking behavior by media outlets, it does not allow for the publication of material one knows to be false. the filing, korzenik said, ""certainly puts fox in the actual malice crosshairs and puts them in real jeopardy."" ronnell andersen jones, a professor and media law scholar at the university of utah, described the evidence as ""pretty voluminous"" and said that she too had never seen evidence like it collected in a high-profile defamation case against an outlet as enormous as fox. ""this is a pretty staggering brief,"" jones said. ""dominion's filing here is unique not just as to the volume of the evidence but also as to the directness of the evidence and the timeline of the evidence."" ""this 'out of the horse's mouth' evidence of knowing falsity is not something we often see,"" jones added. ""when coupled with the compelling storyline that dominion is telling about motivation — the evidence that at least some key players in the organization were actively looking to advance some election denialism in order to win back viewers who had departed — it makes for a strong actual malice storyline."" in a statement, fox news accused dominion of generating ""noise and confusion,"" adding, ""the core of this case remains about freedom of the press and freedom of speech, which are fundamental rights afforded by the constitution and protected by new york times v. sullivan."" ""dominion has mischaracterized the record, cherry-picked quotes stripped of key context, and spilled considerable ink on facts that are irrelevant under black-letter principles of defamation law,"" the network said. ""their motion for summary judgment takes an extreme and unsupported view of defamation law and rests on an accounting of the facts that has no basis in the record."" but the attorneys said dominion's filing showed it had built a powerful case against fox.

Media outlets ask Georgia Supreme Court to release full grand jury report on Trump 2020 election probe,2023-02-24,58.0,"a coalition of media outlets is asking the georgia supreme court to reconsider a decision that blocked the full release of a fulton county special grand jury report, which includes recommendations for whether former president donald trump or any of his associates should face criminal charges for their efforts to undermine the 2020 election. a lower court order blocking most of the report's release ""prevented the public and press from reading the full report even though it addresses a subject of paramount public concern to this state and nation: possible wrongdoing in connection with the us presidential election of 2020, including possible wrongdoing by the then sitting us president,"" the media coalition, which includes cnn, argued friday in a court filing. the georgia supreme court can decide whether or not to take up the appeal, which comes after fulton county superior court judge robert mcburney released snippets of the report earlier this month. but mcburney, who oversaw the special grand jury, decided to keep the vast majority of the document under seal, including recommendations for who should face criminal charges. mcburney wrote in his decision that it was a matter of ""fundamental fairness"" to keep the special grand jury's conclusions under wraps to protect the rights of potential defendants and others named in the report. ""here, however, for anyone named in the special purpose grand jury's final report who was not afforded the opportunity to appear before the grand jury, none of those due process rights has been satisfied,"" mcburney wrote in his february order. ""and for those who did appear -- willingly or not -- only the right to be heard (although without counsel or rebuttal) was protected."" the media coalition argued friday that the special grand jury's report constitutes a court document primed for public release and claimed the reputational concerns of those named in the report do not outweigh the public's interest in viewing its findings. ""the report should be a public court record so that the citizens of the nation and this county can determine for themselves whether the future prosecutorial decisions of the district attorney's office 'do justice' under georgia's laws,"" the media coalition wrote. fulton county district attorney fani willis, an elected democrat, has previously argued against the report's public release, citing her ongoing investigation. ultimately, the special grand jury can't issue indictments on its own. it will be up to willis to determine who to pursue charges against. since mcburney's decision to keep most of the report secret, more information about the panel's findings has publicly emerged. emily kohrs, the foreperson for the special grand jury granted a handful of media interviews, including with cnn, in which she suggested the panel had recommended more than a dozen people for indictment. she declined to say whether trump was on that list of recommendations, but told cnn, ""there may be some names on that list that you wouldn't expect. but the big name that everyone keeps asking me about -- i don't think you will be shocked."" trump's lawyers have slammed the foreperson's media tour, saying in a statement that the media blitz ""proves that whatever conclusions were drawn"" by the grand jury ""were not the result of an analytical, trustworthy, or credible investigation, as one would expect in a matter of historic proportion such as this.""",3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.5126179332534472,0.45286505700399476,0.03451698087155819,-0.685430133587901,0,0,0,0,-2.056290400763703,-7.99735935609175,14.0,-0.5712399540065536
Exclusive: How a box with classified documents ended up in Trump's office months after FBI searched Mar-a-Lago,2023-02-24,59.0,"the justice department wants to know how a box containing a handful of classified records scattered among copies of presidential schedules turned up at mar-a-lago late last year, well after several rounds of searches of the property by federal agents and aides to former president donald trump, according to people familiar with the matter. investigators working for special counsel jack smith in recent weeks have interviewed a trump aide who copied classified materials found in the box using her phone to put them onto a laptop. after a voluntary interview with the aide, prosecutors subpoenaed the password to the laptop, which she provided, according to one of the sources. the classified documents contained in the box were discovered in december, after the justice department told trump's legal team to conduct yet another search for documents at trump's mar-a-lago resort. people familiar with the trump legal team's efforts to locate documents describe a confusing chain of events that delayed discovery of the box, including having its contents uploaded to the cloud, emailed to a trump employee, and moved to an offsite location before finally ending up back at a mar-a-lago bridal suite that is now trump's office -- the very place that the fbi had searched just weeks earlier. trump's legal team has acknowledged in recent weeks they turned over to the special counsel the box and a laptop containing its scanned contents. but prosecutors have continued asking why it wasn't given to the justice department earlier, and what if any role or knowledge trump may have had about its movements, sources said. the odyssey of the box has been a recent focus of smith's investigation into the mishandling of classified documents at mar-a-lago, according to people familiar with the line of questioning from federal prosecutors. the haphazard handling of documents that ended up online, on computers and moved around to multiple locations could further complicate trump's case in an investigation with criminal implications. one person who described the box's movements and the special counsel's inquiry into it described federal investigators as suspecting a ""shell game with classified documents."" the person said trump's daily movements and instructions to staff are a core part of prosecutors' questions as well. tim parlatore, an attorney for trump, said in an interview with cnn earlier this month that the aide had not seen the classified markings. ""after we did the search in december and found within this box of thousands that there were a couple of pages that had a little marking at the bottom, which we turned over, after that, we found out that she had scanned the box so that it would be digitized,"" parlatore said. ""she had no idea that there was any classification markings on anything. and as soon as we found out about that, we called up the doj to let them know and immediately provided them access to it."" a spokesman for the special counsel's office declined to comment. from tennis cottage to bridal suite in the fall of 2021, a longtime trump staffer at the white house and mar-a-lago initially sent the box to a lower-level trump aide, who has been employed by the former president since he left office. the staffer wanted copies of presidential schedules in the box to be scanned. the aide took the box to mar-a-lago's ""tennis cottage,"" where she worked. no scanning machine was available there for the aide to use, so she turned the documents into scanned files using an adobe application on her phone, uploading them to a trump-owned laptop, according to people familiar with the matter. as she worked through the thousands of pages over several days, she didn't notice there were classified documents among the presidential records, the people said. in november 2021, after the contents in the box were scanned, the box was moved to an office in downtown palm beach funded by the general services administration, the people said. the box remained there even after trump's team gave 15 boxes containing classified and other federal records to the national archives in january 2022. the justice department then subpoenaed for the return of all classified records in trump's possession in may 2022, and his lawyers handed over some additional documents to justice department investigators who visited mar-a-lago and toured the space in an attempt to reclaim more documents in june. the fbi then searched mar-a-lago in august while trump was at his golf club in bedminster, new jersey, retrieving more than a hundred records marked as classified in certain rooms at the club, including a bridal suite converted into trump's office and other locations where boxes were kept. but this particular box was at the palm beach office during that search. when trump returned to mar-a-lago last fall, along with his aide, the box was retrieved from the palm beach office and brought to the bridal suite at mar-a-lago where the aide was now working alongside trump in a new role, people familiar with the matter said. tracking down the box in november at the behest of the justice department, trump's legal team hired two people to search four additional locations for classified documents: bedminster, trump tower in new york, a storage unit in florida and the palm beach office where the box had been for nearly a year. during those searches, two additional classified documents were found in the storage unit, which they handed over to prosecutors. trump's team had hoped their searches in november -- and assertions in writing that they've scoured trump's properties and handed over all classified records -- put to rest prosecutors' concerns. the trump lawyers argued that the fbi had already searched mar-a-lago in august. but the justice department demanded that trump lawyers also do another search of the property themselves as they threatened to hold trump in contempt. during the december search of mar-a-lago, the box containing the handful of classified documents intermingled with trump's presidential schedules was at last discovered, according to the people familiar with the search efforts. ""when the team found the box, it was initially believed that the fbi had simply missed it during the search warrant. but upon further investigation, the legal team discovered that an aide had moved it as part of her job function,"" one source said. by that point, the box had been moved into a closet in the suite where trump campaign memorabilia was stored, the people said. trump's lawyers then turned over the box to the justice department. in recent weeks, prosecutors secured grand jury testimony from the two people hired to search trump's properties last fall and have been pursuing answers from his lawyers.

Fact check: Pence falsely claims opponents admitted there weren't Chinese spy balloons over the US while he was VP,2023-02-24,60.0,"former vice president mike pence, who is now considering a run for president, was asked on fox on wednesday about the biden administration's criticism of rail deregulation efforts by the trump administration. fox host martha maccallum told pence that, in the wake of the train derailment in east palestine, ohio, in early february, ""they're blaming the trump administration. they say it's the regulations that you peeled back that led to this lack of safety."" pence replied: ""yeah, same crowd that said that chinese balloons floated over our administration, right -- until they admitted that they didn't."" facts first: pence's claim is false. neither the biden administration nor the pentagon has ""admitted"" that chinese spy balloons didn't float over the united states during the trump-pence administration. in fact, the biden administration and the pentagon have said this month that chinese spy balloons did float over the us during the trump-pence era. the pentagon has briefed congress about these suspected trump-era incidents; former trump administration national security officials who were briefed by the intelligence community last week have not disputed the existence of these incidents after the briefings; and cnn has viewed excerpts from a 2022 military intelligence report that said a chinese spy balloon in 2019 ""drifted past hawaii and across florida before continuing its journey."" former trump national security adviser robert o'brien told cnn last week that his briefing made clear that ""nothing like"" this year's chinese balloon incident, ""with the balloon loitering over us nuclear sites,"" took place under trump. but o'brien did not say the trump-era incidents didn't happen at all. rather, he said that ""we were not briefed during the trump administration on this program, and most of this was discovered after we left office. most of it quite recently."" cnn has reported that three chinese spy balloons are suspected to have transited over the continental us under trump. pentagon spokesperson john kirby said early this month that these previous suspected incursions were ""brief"" and ""nothing at all like what we saw last week in terms of duration."" regardless, contrary to pence's insinuation, the incursions are certainly still suspected to have occurred. pence's explanation cnn asked pence's team on wednesday what he was talking about when he claimed an unnamed ""crowd"" had ""admitted"" that chinese balloons didn't float over the us while he was vice president. a pence spokesperson responded thursday by saying that pence was noting that although the biden administration had tried to distract from its own poor handling of the new balloon incident by claiming ""spy balloons entered the united states during the trump administration,"" such claims ""were debunked when norad and other national security officials admitted these detections were not made by their agencies until after the trump administration left office."" but if trump-era balloon incidents were not discovered until after trump left office, as biden officials and the commander of the north american aerospace defense command have indeed said, this belated discovery clearly does not ""debunk"" the fact that the incidents happened in the first place. the us military shot down the latest suspected chinese spy balloon on biden's orders over the atlantic ocean on february 4 after it drifted off the east coast. the balloon had entered us airspace over alaska on january 28, and then, after floating over canada, returned to us airspace over idaho on january 31, according to a senior defense official. many republicans, including pence, argued that the balloon should have been shot down sooner; defense officials said they waited because they did not want to risk having falling debris harm people or property on the ground.",11.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.48610802401195874,0.4952568330548026,0.01863512731241909,-0.6608892710028598,0,0,0,0,-7.269781981031457,-23.541189279842353,45.0,-0.5231375395520523
"Celebrities may have helped shape anti-vaccine opinions during Covid-19 pandemic, study finds",2023-02-24,61.0,"covid-19 vaccines are known to be safe and effective, and they're available for free, but many americans in the us refuse to get them -- and a recent study suggests that celebrities may share some of the blame for people's mistrust. celebrities have long tried to positively influence public health, studies show, but during the covid-19 pandemic, they also seemed to have a large influence on spreading misinformation. decades ago, in the 1950s, people could see stars like elvis presley, dick van dyke and ella fitzgerald in tv ads that encouraged polio vaccination. this celebrity influence boosted the country's general vaccination efforts, and vaccination nearly eliminated the deadly disease. in 2021, us officials used celebrities in tv ads to encourage more people to get vaccinated against covid-19. big names like lifestyle guru martha stewart, singer charlie puth and even senate minority leader mitchell mcconnell showed up in spots that had billions of ad impressions. the world isn't restricted to only three tv networks any more, so celebrities like actress hilary duff, actor dwayne ""the rock"" johnson, singer dolly parton and even big bird also used their enormous presence on instagram and twitter to promote a pro covid-19 vaccine message. but social media also became a vehicle for celebrities to cast doubt about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine and even to spread disinformation about covid. their negative messages seemed to find an audience. for their study, published in the journal bmj health & care informatics, researchers examined nearly 13 million tweets between january 2020 and march 2022 about covid-19 and vaccines. they designed a natural language model to determine the sentiment of each tweet and compared them with tweets that also mentioned people in the public eye. the stars they picked to analyze included people who had shared skepticism about the vaccines, who had covid-related tweets that were identified as misinformation or who retweeted misinformation about covid. they included rapper nicki minaj, football player aaron rodgers, tennis player novak djokovic, singer eric clapton, sen. rand paul, former president donald trump, sen. ted cruz, florida gov. ron desantis, tv host tucker carlson and commentator joe rogan. the researchers found 45,255 tweets from 34,407 unique authors talking about covid-19 vaccine-related issues. those tweets generated a total of 16.32 million likes. the tweets from these influencers, overall, were more negative about the vaccine than positive, the study found. these tweets were specifically more related to antivaccine controversy, rather than news about vaccine development, the study said. the highest number of negative comments was associated with rodgers and minaj. clapton had ""very few"" positive tweets, the study said, and that may have had an influence, but he also caught flak for it from the public. the most-liked tweet that mentioned clapton and the vaccine said, ""strongly disagree with [ec] ... take on covid and the vaccine and disgusted by his previous white supremacist comments. but if you reference the death of his son to criticize him, you are an ignorant scumbag."" trump and cruz were found to have the most substantial impact within this group, with combined likes totaling more than 122,000. they too came in for criticism on the topic, with many users wondering whether these politicians were qualified to have opinions about the vaccines. the study said the most-liked tweet mentioning cruz was, ""i called ted cruz's office asking to make an appointment to talk with the senator about my blood pressure. they told me that the senator was not qualified to give medical advice and that i should call my doctor. so i asked them to stop advising about vaccines."" the most-liked tweet associated with rogan was an antivaxx statement: ""i love how the same people who don't want us to listen to joe rogan, aaron rodgers about the covid vaccine, want us to listen to big bird & elmo."" posts shared by news anchors and politicians seemed to have the most influence in terms of the most tweets and retweets, the study found. ""our findings suggest that the presence of consistent patterns of emotional content co-occurring with messaging shared by those persons in the public eye that we've mentioned, influenced public opinion and largely stimulated online public discourse, for the at least over the course of the first two years of the covid pandemic,"" said study co-author brianna white, a research coordinator in the population health intelligence lab at the university of tennessee health science center -- oak ridge national laboratory center for biomedical informatics. ""we also argue that obviously as the risk of severe negative health outcomes increase with the failure to comply with health protective behavior recommendations, that our findings suggest that polarized messages from societal elite may downplay those severe negative health outcome risks."" the study doesn't get into exactly why celebrity tweets would have such an impact on people's attitudes about the vaccine. dr. ellen selkie, who has conducted research on influence at the intersection of social media, celebrity and public health outcomes, said celebrities are influential because they attract a lot of attention. ""i think part of the influence that media have on behavior has to do with the amount of exposure. just in general, the volume of content that is focused on a specific topic or on a specific sort of interpretation of that topic -- in this case misinformation -- the repeated exposure to any given thing is going to increase the likelihood that it's going to have an effect,"" said selkie, who was not involved in the new research. she is an adolescent health pediatrician and researcher with uw health kids and an assistant professor of pediatrics at the university of wisconsin school of medicine and public health. just as people listen to a friend's thoughts, they'll listen to a celebrity whom they tend to like or identify with because they trust their opinion. ""with fandoms, in terms of the relationship between musical artists and actors and their fans, there is this sort of mutual love that fans and artists have for each other, which sort of can approximate that sense that they're looking out for each other,"" selkie said. she said she would be interested to see research on the influence of celebrities who tweeted positive messages about the covid-19 vaccine. the authors of the study hope public health leaders will use the findings right away. ""we argue this threat to population health should create a sense of urgency and warrants public health response to identify, develop and implement innovative mitigation strategies,"" the study says. exposure to large amounts of this misinformation can have a lasting impact and work against the public's best interest when it comes to their health. ""as populations grow to trust the influential nature of celebrity activity on social platforms, followers are disarmed and open to persuasion when faced with false information, creating opportunities for dissemination and rapid spread of misinformation and disinformation,"" the study says.",2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.17348847072571516,0.6137478947639465,0.21276365034282207,0.19630529506509806,0,0,0,0,0.3926105901301961,-19.205242304666626,42.0,-0.45726767392063394
Conservative former judge J. Michael Luttig blasts Mike Pence plan to defy subpoena,2023-02-24,62.0,"in a stern rebuke of former vice president mike pence, the conservative former judge who advised pence on how to handle the january 6, 2021, election certification vote is now warning of both the legal and political consequences of pence's plan to fight the grand jury subpoena by special counsel jack smith. ""we can expect the federal courts to make short shrift of this 'hail mary' claim and mr. pence doesn't have a chance in the world of winning his case in any federal court and avoiding testifying before the grand jury,"" former judge j. michael luttig says in an op-ed published in the new york times on friday. luttig calls pence's vow to resist the subpoena a ""dangerous gambit"" and one that will invite an ""embarrassing spectacle."" ""no prosecutor, least of all mr. smith, will abide this political gambit for long,"" luttig says. the op-ed was published the day after cnn and others reported that federal prosecutors are asking a judge to compel pence to testify in smith's probe. in recent public comments, pence has said he will fight the subpoena on the grounds that, under the constitution's speech or debate clause, the executive branch cannot compel his testimony before a grand jury. the clause shields lawmakers from certain law enforcement actions that target their legislative conduct. pence and his team have argued that they believe the former vice president is also covered under it in the role he was serving, during congress' january 6, 2021, certification vote, as president of the senate. luttig predicts in the op-ed that pence's arguments will fail, writing that even if the courts find that pence is entitled to some protections under the constitutional provision, they will ""unquestionably hold that mr. pence is nonetheless required to testify in response to mr. smith's subpoena."" luttig also says that pence and his lawyers are ""mistaken"" if they think that litigation will tie up the courts for ""months and months."" ""what mr. smith wants to know about are mr. pence's communications and interactions with mr. trump before, and perhaps during, the vote count, which are entirely fair game for a grand jury investigating possible crimes against the united states,"" luttig writes. luttig's public condemnation of pence's claims is notable, given the counsel he gave pence and his team that the former vice president did not have the authority to disrupt the congressional certification vote -- counsel pence ultimately followed. luttig has previously praised pence for withstanding former president donald trump's pressure to halt the certification of president joe biden's win. luttig testified before the house january 6 select committee, which was disbanded with the new congress this year. luttig has deep roots in the conservative legal movement. he clerked for the late justice antonin scalia when scalia was on the powerful dc federal appeals court. luttig counts among his former clerks republican sen. ted cruz and fbi director chris wray, as well as john eastman, the attorney who spearheaded the plan to disrupt congress certification of the 2020 results. in his op-ed, luttig defends smith's investigation and disputes pence's accusation that the subpoena for his testimony is politically motivated. ""injecting campaign-style politics into the criminal investigatory process with his rhetorical characterization of mr. smith's subpoena as a 'biden d.o.j. subpoena,' mr. pence is trying to score points with voters who want to see president biden unseated in 2024. well enough. that's what politicians do,"" luttig writes. ""but jack smith's subpoena was neither politically motivated nor designed to strengthen president biden's political hand in 2024. thus the jarring dissonance between the subpoena and mr. pence's characterization of it. it is mr. pence who has chosen to politicize the subpoena, not the d.o.j."" the former judge goes on to say that pence's plan to fight the subpoena risks a political backlash. pointing to pence's promise to take the subpoena battle to the supreme court, luttig writes: ""a politician should be careful what he wishes for -- no more so than when he's a possible presidential candidate who would have the supreme court decide a constitutional case that could undermine his viability in an upcoming campaign.""

Judge tosses out disciplinary action against Sidney Powell for work on Trump election reversal bid,2023-02-24,63.0,"a texas judge on thursday dismissed the petition brought by state bar of texas' commission for lawyer discipline alleging that attorney sidney powell had violated legal ethics rules with her work on former president donald trump's 2020 election reversal gambits. judge andrea bouressa, who presides in texas' 471st district court, said the commission had not met its burden in proving that powell had run afoul of texas' attorney code of conduct. the judge also knocked the commission for not properly labeling its exhibits in its filing, leading her to only consider two of the exhibits the commission had filed. it is possible that the dismissal order could be appealed, but a spokesperson for the disciplinary commission declined to comment. the attorney who represented powell in the disciplinary proceedings did not respond to cnn's inquiry. the disciplinary proceedings for the ex-trump attorney unfolded in state court in texas, where she is licensed, after a march 1 petition from the texas bar's disciplinary commission asked the court to find her in violation of the professional code for attorneys in the state. as cnn previously reported, those who have sought disciplinary responses for trump's legal allies say the post-election conduct crossed ethical lines into the realm of professional misconduct -- and that the tactics were well outside the normal bounds of legal challenges to election procedures. a number of former trump lawyers, including rudy giuliani and john eastman, have faced state bar reviews.",4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.7961841970682144,0.19406142458319664,0.009754355880431831,-0.9968102449436785,0,0,0,0,-3.987240979774714,-20.290848618327725,41.0,-0.4948987467884811
McCarthy rewards the pro-Trump radicals who put him in power,2023-02-24,64.0,"house speaker kevin mccarthy is keeping his word to radicals who put him in power and rewarding those who can keep him there, paving a smooth start to his tenure that may, however, be storing up trouble down the road. the california republican handed hard-right house members with plum committee assignments, dumped several high-profile democrats from key panels to please the conservative media universe, launched investigations into the ""weaponization"" of government against republicans like former president donald trump and gave a pass to georgia rep. marjorie taylor greene when she heckled president joe biden during the state of the union address or suggested ""national divorce"" between red and blue states. he's refused to demand the resignation of new york rep. george santos, a serial fabulist, who might be an embarrassment but whose seat remains critical to the gop's tiny majority. this week, in his most stunning move yet, mccarthy is giving fox news host tucker carlson exclusive access to security footage of the january 6, 2021, us capitol insurrection. the move may fuel carlson's false claims and conspiracies about a heinous attack on american democracy. the fox primetime star has in the past baselessly claimed people working for the fbi orchestrated the invasion of congress. mccarthy is currying favor with a past critic and supremely powerful media host he'd love to get on his side as he tries to rule his conference and court the conservative base. he's already used the effort in fundraising appeals. and his move may also help whitewash trump's culpability for the insurrection, weeks after the ex-president played a role in helping him win the speakership. a smooth start to mccarthy's speakership after appeasing demands from gop holdouts and finally securing the speakership on the 15th roll call vote last month, mccarthy's opponents argue that he's now cravenly paying back the most extreme members of the most radical gop conference in modern american history. but perhaps, he's also purchasing goodwill among his members that could give him more maneuvering room when he needs votes later in the year over critically important issues like raising the government's borrowing limit, agreeing on a budget and sending more military aid to ukraine. yet there's little in mccarthy's past as a republican leader that suggests he has such political dexterity. and the most riotous members of the house gop seem highly unlikely to accept mccarthy's concessions and fall in line. nor does the uncompromising ideology of some of the political and media influencers he's courting suggest they'd be content to cede power to him. and as mccarthy parries accusations that he's acting from naked political motivations, he's adopting superficially principled justifications that mock his critics. he told the new york times he handed over the security tapes because he had ""promised"" to do so. the speaker gave such an undertaking to florida rep. matt gaetz, a gop source told cnn's melanie zanona, in his quest to secure the gavel, but the apparent deal did not specify that carlson should get the footage. mccarthy suggested to the times he was also acting in the interests of transparency. ""i was asked in the press about these tapes, and i said they do belong to the american public. i think sunshine lets everybody make their own judgment."" except, he's not giving them to the american people so anyone can see them, or releasing them to all media, at least yet. the speaker is specifically offering access to a conservative tv host who has made no secret of his agenda. had he wanted to create that ray of sunshine, mccarthy could have posted them online, tasked congressional committees to examine them or invited other media outlets to also view them. the credibility of fox news -- carlson's television home and the apparent destiny of the tapes -- has, meanwhile, taken a hit following revelations from text messages and emails in a court filing this week that some of fox's biggest stars and executives privately dismissed trump's lies about voter fraud after the 2020 election but allowed them to dominate its airwaves. just as mccarthy is apparently unwilling to challenge the power of conservative media, fox appeared unwilling to alienate a conservative audience that wanted to believe trump won. cnn has reached out to fox news and carlson with questions about how the security footage will be handled but had not received a response as of thursday evening. mccarthy also tried to cast his stance on santos, who lied about large portions of his biography and career resume, as a democratic one. ""the voters of his district have elected him,"" mccarthy said of the freshman in january, suggesting that to demand the resignation of the new york republican would be an affront to democracy -- even though it appears voters had no idea of the truth about santos when they sent him to washington. mccarthy has since hinted that his position could change if the house ethics committee ""finds something"" against santos, who won a district that biden carried in 2020 and that could be tough for the gop to hold. mccarthy's stances have led to criticism and enraged democrats, who say his release of the footage to carlson could endanger the security of the capitol. but in america's bitter political climate, appealing to activist political bases is often the first consideration -- especially in the radicalized republican party of the trump era. in the modern gop, earning the anger of the media is an essential element of appealing to grassroots voters and often seems a major motivation of top party figures. mccarthy's coming dilemmas previous republican speakers like john boehner and paul ryan tried to manage their radical right-wing conferences while staying faithful to the institutional responsibilities of their leadership position. it was a balancing act that eventually doomed their tenures. mccarthy appears to be taking the opposite tack, throwing his lot in completely with the extremists who have outsized influence due to the far-smaller-than-expected house majority the gop managed to win in the 2022 midterms. but his accommodation of his conference might only work in the short term. in a sign of growing trouble, a border security bill that mccarthy had hoped to pass early in the new congress is still in limbo after moderates voiced fierce opposition to a three-page draft drawn up by conservative rep. chip roy from texas. the dispute underscores the fatal flaw in the gop majority between right-wingers keen to appeal to the base and moderates who won seats in states like new york and california, where they could face difficult reelection bids in 2024. cnn also reported this week on bitter splits between factions of the gop on the question of more aid for ukraine. mccarthy has tried to finesse this divide by saying he favors support for the kyiv government but is also against a ""blank check"" for president volodymyr zelensky -- in a nod to lawmakers like gaetz and greene who oppose multi-billion dollar us aid packages. the speaker's position is allowing him to avoid alienating either faction so far, but it will come under fierce pressure when massive requests for arms and ammunition for ukraine arrive on capitol hill. mccarthy also appears to be navigating into a perilous position on a looming showdown with biden over the need to raise the government's borrowing authority, or the debt ceiling, later this year. if the authority is not granted by congress, the us could default on its obligations, shredding its credit rating and throwing the american and global economies into turmoil. but mccarthy is standing with the most radical members of his conference who are demanding huge spending cuts, which biden has refused to accept, in order to lift the debt ceiling. the california republican may end up with a fateful choice between backing the lawmakers who elected him speaker and crashing the economy, since, if he tried to grant biden such authority by using some democratic votes, it's possible he'd be toppled.

Appeals court questions access that prosecutors can have to a GOP lawmaker's phone seized in 2020 election investigation,2023-02-23,65.0,"a federal appeals court on thursday questioned the access that justice department prosecutors can have to a gop lawmaker's phone seized as part of the special counsel investigation into 2020 election subversion. at a partially public hearing thursday, the us dc circuit court of appeals grappled with the scope of a constitutional provision that shields legislators from certain law enforcement actions and had tough questions for both the attorney representing republican rep. scott perry, whose phone was seized by the fbi in august, and for the justice department attorney arguing in favor of prosecutors being able to obtain communications from the device. many details of the dispute remain shrouded in secrecy, including an underlying district court opinion that perry appealed to the circuit court. an attorney for perry said thursday that the files in question pertained to the discussions the pennsylvania congressman was having about two legislative matters: a election rules reform bill congress was considering in early 2021 and perry's vote on the january 6, 2021, certification of the presidential election results. a lawyer for the special counsel's office did not provide that level of detail about what's at issue in the case, argued that the justice department should be able to access a member of congress' cell phone records if they were making calls as informal research before a possible legislative vote. the key issue in the case is whether the constitution's so-called speech or debate clause -- which says legislators cannot be questioned on ""any speech or debate"" in congress -- applies to a lawmaker's ""informal fact finding"" that was not formally authorized by congress. two judges on the circuit panel -- circuit judges gregory katsas and neomi rao, both trump appointees -- zeroed in on this issue in their questions for doj attorney john pellettieri. they seemed to balk at the hard line he drew that those kinds of informal communications were not protected by the clause. the judges, however, also grilled rowley on whether he was pushing a virtually limitless interpretation of the clause that would shield all sort of communications lawmakers had, including with individuals not in congress. ""shouldn't we put weight on the fact that what we're talking about here seems far afield from speech or debate?"" katsas asked rowley. how the dc circuit views the 17-word constitutional provision could have implications not just for how the trump investigations proceed, but what sort of immunity legislators have in all sorts of court proceedings going forward -- particularly if the conduct is not clearly part of their formal activities in congress. ""we want members of congress to be able to do their jobs without constantly being hauled into court,"" said elliot williams, a former justice department official who also worked for the senate judiciary committee. ""but it defies logic and probably the constitution for congress to think it can wave a wand and call everything it touches quote 'informal legislative fact-finding.'"" perry was identified by the house january 6 committee as a player in trump's efforts to weaponize the justice department. perry did not comply with a subpoena from the committee for his testimony. after the fbi seized perry's phone access, he filed a public lawsuit challenging investigators' access to its contents. however, the wrangling between him and the justice department has played out in private court proceedings. only the first hour or so of the roughly 90 minute hearing played out in open court, with the latter part of the proceedings taking place under seal. no 'get out of jail free card' the constitution's speech or debate clause says that ""for any speech or debate in either house,"" lawmakers ""shall not be questioned in any other place."" it functions as a separation-of-powers provision that prevents legislators from being arrested or being forced to participate in court proceedings for their legislative conduct on the congressional floor. courts have also said the clause extends to lawmaker conduct in congressional committee proceedings and that it also can cover congressional staff. the speech of debate clause is ""not a get out of jail free card,"" thomas spulak, who served as general counsel to the house of representatives in the 1990s, told cnn this week. ""it only protects them from questioning, being subpoenaed or anything else for any legislative acts,"" spulak said. ""what we're seeing today is a judicial analysis of what defines a legislative act."" in the judges' questions for the doj thursday, the dc circuit panel appeared sympathetic to perry's position that informal discussions that legislators have with outside parties can amount to the type of legislative activity covered by the clause. ""suppose a member is deliberating how to vote. they do a series of calls to key stakeholders and records the calls. you think you can get that?"" katsas asked pellettieri. rao asked the doj lawyer: ""why is an individual's fact finding not a precursor to legislative proceeding?"" already, the speech or debate clause has been invoked in disputes arising from investigations into 2020 election subversion, including when south carolina gop sen. lindsey graham tried to resist a testimonial subpoena issued in the fulton county grand jury probe. rowley, at thursday's hearing, pointed to the graham case and other decisions as supporting perry's arguments. he offered the recent trail derailment in ohio as an example of the type of matter a lawmaker would do his own research on for potential legislation even though congress had not yet set up a formal investigation. still, the judges hinted their wariness of interpreting the provision too broadly ""i am wondering what you think might be the limits of such a non-disclosure privilege,"" rao asked rowley. what kind of ""informal"" fact-finding amounts to covered legislative activity? in seeking to block doj's access to perry's phone, his lawyers have pointed specifically to a 2007 ruling concerning an fbi search of then-rep. william jefferson's congressional office in a bribery probe. the dc circuit said that the justice department ran afoul of the constitutional clause by sorting through the louisiana democrat's files without his consent. chief judge beryl howell, however, ruled under seal that in perry's case, some of the communications on perry's phones wouldn't fall under his legislative work because they weren't sanctioned by any legislative authority. she said that investigators could access certain materials on perry's phone that his lawyers had argued should be withheld. howell's ruling did, however, allow perry to protect some of his phone contents under the speech or debate clause, a source familiar with the investigation told cnn. to make her decision, howell confidentially reviewed details about the information that was on perry's phone that the justice department sought, the source said. prosecutors still haven't gotten access to the more than 2,000 records they seek. the dc circuit court of appeals above howell has put on hold her rulings, including investigators' ability to access perry's phone records, as it hears arguments in the case on a much-quicker-than-usual timeline. on thursday, perry's attorney said that his circumstances were parallel to the 2007 case, with the difference being this search is of a cell phone instead of an office. the judges, however, asked rowley whether the immunity applies once a lawmaker speaks to parties outside of congress -- and questioned whether that could theoretically cover all kinds of communications of a member of congress using a cell phone. ""it's not the cell phone that makes this odd, it's that the communication can be to anyone in the universe,"" katsas told rowley. circuit judge karen henderson, the third member of the panel, participated in thursday's hearing remotely. henderson, an appointee of president george h.w. bush, was on the circuit panel in the william jefferson case and wrote a concurrence that took a much narrower view of the speech or debate clause than the one embraced by the other judges on that decision. the dc circuit is also considering whether it has the authority to intervene at this point, but the judges asked the parties to focus on the other legal questions in the case when arguing on thursday. the house -- with the approval of both majority and minority leadership -- has sought to weigh in on the case, in a sign of how the perry litigation could set the rules for how the immunity applies to all sorts of lawmaker activity going forward. the house's filings, however, are not public. spulak noted that, practically speaking, the role of a congressperson has become ""pretty broad"" over time and that their legislative duties can go beyond talking about a specific piece of legislation, ""since oversight is fundamental to the legislative process."" in the graham case, the us supreme court refused to block the fulton county grand jury's subpoena for his testimony. the justices stressed that the lower courts that ordered his appearance had said that the speech or debate clause precluded him from question about the ""informal investigative fact finding"" that was part of his legislative activity. the dc circuit's consideration of the perry case could flesh out what kind of informal fact-finding amounts to protected legislative activity. ""depending on how broad you read what a legislative act is, it could permit members of congress to really cover lots of their conduct within the speech or debate clause that i think we would generally not think would be covered,"" said neil eggleston, a former white house counsel under president barack obama. this story has been updated with additional developments thursday.",3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.4360695065309604,0.5202006896336874,0.04372984233001868,-0.6335731597240509,0,0,0,0,-1.9007194791721527,-9.787537497882056,16.0,-0.6117210936176285
Biden nominates former MasterCard exec Ajay Banga to lead World Bank,2023-02-23,66.0,"president joe biden has announced that he's nominating ajay banga, a former mastercard executive, to serve as president of the world bank. in a statement, biden said that banga is ""uniquely equipped to lead the world bank at this critical moment in history"" and that he has a ""proven track record managing people and systems, and partnering with global leaders around the world to deliver results."" banga has been the vice chairman at general atlantic, a new york-based investment firm, since 2022. prior to that, the 63-year-old was the ceo of mastercard from 2010 to 2021. ""raised in india, ajay has a unique perspective on the opportunities and challenges facing developing countries and how the world bank can deliver on its ambitious agenda to reduce poverty and expand prosperity,' biden said in the statement. notably, the white house highlighted banga's ""extensive experience"" in creating partnerships to address climate change and financial inclusion,"" something biden pledged would be an important qualification for the next world bank president. banga would replace previous president david malpass, who announced last week that he's stepping down a year early — serving four years of a five-year term. although malpass had been praised by the world bank and administration officials for his handling of the global challenges posed by russia's invasion of ukraine and the covid-19 pandemic, his tenure faced controversy following comments he made last september about climate change. during a panel, herefused to confirm during a climate panel whether he accepted the scientific consensus that burning fossil fuels were dangerously warming the planet. after an outpouring of criticism, many opponents called for his resignation. however, he recently told cnn's julia chatterley that he has ""no regrets"" over his four-year tenure.

McCarthy defends release of January 6 footage to Tucker Carlson: 'I promised',2023-02-23,67.0,"house speaker kevin mccarthy defended his controversial move to grant fox news host tucker carlson access to security footage from the january 6, 2021, attack on the capitol, telling the new york times he ""promised."" ""i was asked in the press about these tapes, and i said they do belong to the american public. i think sunshine lets everybody make their own judgment,"" he told the times. mccarthy -- who has already been fundraising on the move -- did indeed promise to release the footage as part of his bid to become speaker, and it was something republican rep. matt gaetz had specifically been demanding. in fact, it was on a lengthy list of demands that gaetz walked into mccarthy's office with on the monday night before the speaker's vote, according to a gop source familiar with the list. but the list did not say the footage needs to go to carlson -- that was decided later. mccarthy could have tasked his own committees with sorting through the footage and presenting it, but a source close to mccarthy said he has long been wary of having the house gop looking like it is investigating or relitigating the january 6 attack. instead, mccarthy opted to give the footage to a friendly conservative media network. specifically, he opted to give the exclusive to carlson, who has been one of the most vocal voices in conservative media calling for the footage to be released. carlson has been a huge mccarthy critic -- so this move could help win the speaker some favor with carlson's camp as mccarthy tries to hold together both the conservative and moderate wings of his republican conference. mccarthy is hoping that outsourcing this work to the media will be a way to appease his right flank without upsetting his moderates and majority makers. but it's a still a big risk, and mccarthy and house republicans could still wind up taking the blame for however this plays out in the media. already, democrats have been quick to criticize the move by mccarthy, warning that it creates a significant security risk. senate majority leader chuck schumer on wednesday blasted mccarthy in a letter to his senate colleagues -- comments that marked the first time schumer has spoken out about the move. schumer said in the letter that, ""the speaker is needlessly exposing the capitol complex"" and that the disclosure ""poses grave security risks to members of congress and everyone who works on capitol hill."" in the letter, schumer said mccarthy's decision to give the footage to carlson ""laid bare that this sham is simply about pandering to maga election deniers, not the truth."" carlson has been one of the most prominent promoters of january 6 conspiracy theories. most notably, he has devoted significant airtime to the false claim that liberal ""deep state"" partisans within the fbi orchestrated the insurrection as a way to undermine former president donald trump. he has conducted sympathetic interviews with some of the rioters who were subsequently charged by the justice department. after more than a dozen news outlets, including cnn, sued for access to the videos in 2021, the chief judge of dc federal court ruled that the public has a strong interest in seeing some security footage from the attack. however, these video releases haven't been automatic or guaranteed. news outlets can request the public release of videos after they are played in open court, on a case-by-case basis.",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.9272457957267761,0.06307312846183777,0.009681053459644318,-1.0,0,0,0,0,-1.0,-9.854156488209,14.0,-0.7038683205863572
"Trump and FBI director can be deposed in lawsuit from ex-FBI agent Peter Strzok, judge rules",2023-02-23,68.0,"former president donald trump and fbi director christopher wray can be deposed as part of a lawsuit from an ex-fbi agent who sued over his 2018 termination, a federal judge ruled thursday. the ruling ends a yearlong dispute over whether the former agent, peter strzok, could question them under oath. strzok's lawsuit alleges that trump's political vendetta prompted his firing and the public release of his texts, in violation of his constitutional rights and the privacy act. dc district judge amy berman jackson held a sealed hearing thursday morning, after which she issued a brief ruling. as part of her ruling, jackson said that the biden white house must decide by late march whether the current president will assert executive privilege over conversations that trump had directly related to strzok's firing. the depositions also must be limited to less than two hours, jackson ruled, and to a narrow set of topics, including the government's decision to fire strzok. the justice department tried to block the subpoenas, arguing that strzok hadn't proven trump played a role in his dismissal. despite trump's repeated and public calls for strzok's dismissal, it was fbi's then-deputy director david bowdich who made the decision to fire him, doj argued. strzok's firing came after an internal investigation into texts he'd exchanged with former fbi lawyer lisa page over concerns they had with a potential trump presidency, as the texts could be interpreted to show political bias. the messages also revealed that strzok and page had had an extramarital relationship. the justice department's inspector general issued reports on both high-profile investigations that strzok and page participated in -- the investigation into hillary clinton's use of private email and the investigation into potential ties between russia and the trump campaign -- and cleared both probes of political bias. page has brought her own lawsuit alleging that the justice department violated the privacy act by releasing their texts, but jackson's order allowing trump and wray to be deposed only applies in strzok's case.",8.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.8106832355260849,0.1803005784167908,0.00901616836199537,-0.917182653805016,0,0,0,0,-7.337461230440128,-13.204376738874412,18.0,-0.7335764854930229
Opinion: Georgia grand juror's tacky media tour won't trash the case,2023-02-23,69.0,"georgia special grand jury foreperson emily kohrs, one of the ""random people"" chosen to help with the sweeping investigation of former president donald trump, has garnered considerable attention by making the major media rounds. it is reminiscent of ""the full ginsberg,"" in which monica lewinsky's lawyer during the clinton impeachment stopped at every sunday show. perhaps we need a new coinage: ""the full kohrs."" it certainly would have been better for decorum if kohrs had refrained from speaking to the media, and she may even trigger motions challenging potential indictments. but that won't change anything legally. any such motions will fail under georgia law because she is neither a member of the regular grand jury that would ultimately issue charges, nor of the trial jury that would adjudicate them. and for that reason, any pr damage is likely to be long forgotten before trials occur. to review the whirlwind of the past days, after portions of the georgia special grand jury report were released, kohrs spoke to a series of major print and broadcast outlets. when asked on cnn about the names recommended for indictment, she stated, ""the big name that everyone keeps asking me about - i don't think you'll be shocked,"" adding that the jurors ""definitely heard a lot about former president trump and we definitely discussed him a lot in the room,"" and that ""i am positive i have heard the president on the phone more than once."" she also described her impressions about other witnesses, including cassidy hutchinson, brad raffensperger, mark meadows and brian kemp, in an interview with the associated press. and she told the atlanta journal-constitution that the evidence considered included new audio recordings that have not yet been made public. she also provided the press with quite a bit of behind the scenes color, for example describing the popsicle she was enjoying when she swore in one witness. after kohrs' public statements, lawyers connected to several witnesses in the fulton county proceedings on wednesday suggested that they would use her remarks in an effort to quash or dismiss the indictments. the argument would presumably be that she violated the secrecy that pertains to the special grand jury proceedings and prejudiced defendants' right to a fair trial. such arguments are doomed under georgia law. georgia does instruct jurors to ""keep the deliberations of the grand jury secret."" but the state's supreme court has explained that ""deliberations"" are quite limited. they do not include ""all things coming to (a) person's knowledge as a result of grand jury attendance."" in fact, grand jury members are not ""bound to secrecy regarding the evidence presented to a grand jury"" -- just their discussions with each other about it. kohrs' statements focus on the demeanor of several gop witnesses, the evidence presented to the grand jury and the fact that the jury concluded its investigation and made recommendations -- not ""deliberations"" to which the special grand jury is ""bound to secrecy."" kohrs' statements did not disclose the content of discussions, even though they indicate that discussions took place. there are also unique considerations because kohrs was the foreperson of a special grand jury -- and a partial report about its investigation was already released. georgia law expressly authorizes the publication of special grand jury reports and recommendations. thus, kohrs' related comments raise a lessened secrecy concern than some have claimed. georgia simply does not afford that degree of legal protection to most aspects of a grand jury's work. indeed, since 1939, georgia courts have recognized that general statements by grand juries, including in published recommendations, did not create a basis for dismissing an indictment. the supervising judge, robert mcburney, alluded to this relatively forgiving standard during oral argument on the motion to release the special grand jury report. pressing the litigants on whether or not to keep all or portions of the report secret, he suggested that there would be nothing to stop special grand jurors from speaking out if they so chose. while he did not formally reach that conclusion, and in fact (kohrs says) provided her with guidelines on what can and cannot be disclosed, his nod at special grand jurors' leeway is notable. perhaps the closest kohrs came to disclosing deliberations was when she stated the special grand jury did not call trump because he ""was not a battle we picked to fight."" but even there, she did not reveal the debate points the grand jurors engaged in to reach that decision. rather, she was stating the outcome. in light of georgia's loose restrictions, that is not enough to cross the line. more fundamentally, like her other statements, that one does not harm the former president or anyone else. that is the final and biggest reason that kohrs' statements cannot result in the dismissals of future indictments: no defendant's rights to a fair trial have been prejudiced. under georgia law, her comments to the press would have to ""(castigate, impugn a defendant's) integrity, ... and subject (him) to the odium of condemnation ... without giving him the slightest opportunity to defend himself."" kohrs has not done that. rather, she mentions general recollections of witnesses and subjects of conversation and does not name individuals recommended for indictment. any individuals ultimately charged will be able to mount defenses in court -- and in the court of public opinion. nor has kohrs revealed any prejudice in the special grand jury's already concluded deliberations. for instance, there is no hint in her remarks of special grand jurors being pressured to decide in one way or another. the da may now seek indictments from a regular grand jury that may have read or seen kohrs' remarks -- but those grand jurors almost certainly have her actual report, so whatever hints kohrs has dropped are hardly news to them. any potential targets might argue the statements will influence the trial jurors, but that can be dealt with during jury selection by asking prospective jurors if they heard the statements and were affected by them. kohrs won't win any prizes for grand jury foreperson etiquette. her display has been unseemly, to say the least. it has violated good taste -- but not the law.",3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.6567964553833008,0.23273019244273505,0.11047328822314739,-0.6412288798526878,0,0,0,0,-1.9236866395580634,-11.990531484017183,16.0,-0.7494082177510739

What to know about the lawsuit aiming to ban medication abortion drug mifepristone,2023-02-11,71.0,"a federal judge could rule any day on a lawsuit seeking to block the use of medication abortion nationwide, in the biggest abortion-related case since the supreme court overturned roe v. wade last year. the lawsuit, filed in november by anti-abortion advocates against the us food and drug administration, targets the agency's two-decade-old approval of mifepristone, the first drug in the medication abortion process. medication abortion, which now makes up a majority of abortions obtained in the us, has become a particularly acute flashpoint in the fallout from the supreme court's decision last year overturning roe v. wade. us district judge matthew kacsmaryk, an appointee of former president donald trump, may act at any time on a motion by the plaintiffs to temporarily block use of the medication. any decision that blocks access to medication abortion -- even temporarily -- will significantly disrupt abortion case nationwide, however. reproductive rights advocates say that if kacsmaryk ultimately sides with the plaintiffs, ""it would eliminate the most commonly used method of abortion care,"" according to naral pro-choice america. here's what to know about the lawsuit: what the lawsuit is seeking the lawsuit, filed last year by a coalition of anti-abortion national medical associations under the umbrella of the ""alliance for hippocratic medicine"" and several doctors, is seeking a number of actions by the court, chief among them a preliminary and permanent injunction ordering the fda ""to withdraw mifepristone and misoprostol as fda-approved chemical abortion drugs and to withdraw defendants' actions to deregulate these chemical abortion drugs."" ""after two decades of engaging the fda to no avail, plaintiffs now ask this court to do what the fda was and is legally required to do: protect women and girls by holding unlawful, setting aside, and vacating the fda's actions to approve chemical abortion drugs and eviscerate crucial safeguards for those who undergo this dangerous drug regimen,"" the complaint reads. the challengers are also targeting the fda's recent moves to make the pills more accessible, which include removing the requirement that the pills be picked up in-person from an abortion provider. what fda says the fda responded to the lawsuit in january by asking the judge to deny the motion for a preliminary injunction, arguing that issuing one in the matter ""would upend the status quo and the reliance interests of patients and doctors who depend on mifepristone, as well as businesses involved with mifepristone distribution."" the agency also says a ruling against it would set a dangerous precedent. ""more generally, if longstanding fda drug approvals were so easily enjoined, even decades after being issued, pharmaceutical companies would be unable to confidently rely on fda approval decisions to develop the pharmaceutical-drug infrastructure that americans depend on to treat a variety of health conditions,"" the fda wrote. ""a preliminary injunction would interfere with congress's decision to entrust fda with responsibility to ensure the safety and efficacy of drugs. in discharging this role, fda applies its technical expertise to make complex scientific determinations about drugs' safety and efficacy, and these determinations are entitled to substantial deference."" what the drug company says danco, which makes mifepristone, also made a similar request to the fda's in a court filing, stressing that the lawsuit could decimate the company's business. the drug company has been allowed to intervene in the case, as the anti-abortion activists are also asking the court to halt the fda's 2016 approval of its version of the medication abortion drug. ""danco is a small pharmaceutical company. it sells one drug: mifeprex,"" lawyers for the company wrote in court papers. ""entering the mandatory preliminary injunction plaintiffs seek would force fda to withdraw approval for danco's only product, effectively shuttering danco's business."" ""congress entrusts decision-making like this with the fda. and they're coming in trying to overrule that, saying this medication is unsafe because women bleed. well, that's part of having an abortion. it's also part of having a pregnancy,"" said ryan brown, an attorney representing danco in the case. ""the bottom line being that they just want to do away with abortion across the board and for any reason."" who is the judge in the case? kacsmaryk was appointed to the court in 2017 by then-president trump and was confirmed by a 52-46 vote in 2019. since then, he's helped make texas a legal graveyard for policies of president joe biden's administration, presiding over 95% of the civil cases brought in amarillo, texas. in december, kacsmaryk put on hold the biden administration's most recent attempt to end the so-called ""remain in mexico"" program. and he has overseen texas cases challenging vaccine mandates, the gender identity guidance issued by the us equal employment opportunity commission and the administration's limits on the use of covid-19 relief funds for tax cuts. before joining the court, kacsmaryk served as deputy general counsel at the first liberty institute, a nonprofit religious liberty legal group, where he worked mainly on ""religious liberty litigation in federal courts and amicus briefs in the us supreme court,"" according to his white house biography. red and blue states weigh in the case is being closely watched by a number of interested parties, including republican and democratic state attorneys general. in february, two different multi-state coalitions filed amicus briefs with the court urging them to act one way or another in the matter. a coalition of 22 democratic attorneys general urged kacsmaryk to deny the motion for a preliminary injunction, writing in court papers that ""annulling -- or even merely limiting -- any of the fda's actions relating to medication abortion would result in an even more drastic reduction in abortion access across the entire nation, worsening already dire outcomes, deepening entrenched disparities in access to health care, and placing a potentially unbearable strain on the health care system as a whole."" they noted that ""the availability of mifepristone has been particularly critical in providing access to abortion in low-income, underserved, and rural communities where procedural abortion may be unavailable,"" adding that since the drug is used more during the first trimester of a pregnancy, ""eliminating access to this method will result in more abortions taking place later in pregnancy, further increasing costs and medical risks."" the democratic attorneys general noted that abortion clinics in their states have already seen a surge in patients because of traffic from residents of states where extreme abortion restrictions are in effect. cutting off access to medication abortion would further overburden those clinics, the blue states argued, as surgical abortion would be the only available method. a coalition of 22 republican attorneys general, meanwhile, asked the court to issue the preliminary injunction, arguing the fda exceeded its authority when it approved the medication. ""state laws on chemical abortion thus account for the public interests at issue -- and they do so with the benefit of democratic legitimacy (and legal authority). the fda's actions can make no such claim. by obstructing the judgments of elected representatives, the agency has undermined the public interest,"" they wrote. what abortion-rights advocates are saying abortion rights advocates have sounded the alarm on the case, stressing that a ruling by kacsmaryk in favor of the plaintiffs would affect every corner of the country since the lawsuit is targeting a federal agency. ""if fda approval of mifepristone is revoked, 64.5 million women of reproductive age in the us would lose access to medication abortion care, an exponential increase in harm overnight,"" naral said in a statement in february, pointing to internal research. ""this research reveals the high stakes of this lawsuit, and we can only expect the worst from this trump-appointed federal judge. americans want access to abortion, but anti-choice bad actors are dead set on restricting reproductive freedom by any means possible,"" said angela vasquez-giroux, the group's vice president of communications and research. and activists quickly mobilized in texas around the issue, with the women's march holding a rally at the federal courthouse in amarillo, texas, in february to protest the suit. ""we've said it before: the fight for reproductive rights now lies in the states, and legal challenges like these are just the latest example of how our fight is bigger than roe,"" said rachel carmona, the executive director of women's march. judge decides against fast-tracking trial kacsmaryk had been considering whether to consolidate a potential hearing on the preliminary injunction request with a trial on the merits of the lawsuit, a move that would have fast-tracked the entire case. he asked the parties to weigh in, with both the plaintiffs and danco voicing support for the consolidation. the fda, however, urged the judge not to fast-track the trial, saying in a brief that because of the plaintiffs' ""extreme delay in filing suit to challenge fda's approval of the drug, there is no reason to decide this case on an emergency basis."" kacsmaryk ultimately decided against fast-tracking the trial, writing in a february 21 order: ""having considered the briefing and relevant law, the court determines that consolidation would not be appropriate in this case."" when will kacsmaryk rule? kacsmaryk told the plaintiffs that they had until february 24 to file a joint response to briefs submitted by the fda and danco. in an earlier order, the judge said that following the deadline, ""briefing will then be closed on the matter, absent any 'exceptional or extraordinary circumstances.'"" now that the response is in, kacsmaryk can rule at any time, though he could also call for a hearing, or ask for additional responses as well. and because he decided against fast-tracking the trial in the case, his first ruling will only be on the preliminary injunction request, which, if granted in full, would temporarily pull the abortion drug from the market. any decision that blocked access to medication abortion -- even temporarily -- will significantly disrupt abortion case nationwide, however. potential supreme court showdown a day before the plaintiffs submitted their brief, 12 states led by liberal attorneys general sued the fda, saying its limits on mifepristone are too strict. the suit creates the possibility of circuit courts offering conflicting takes about the safety of abortion medication and how accessible the drug should be, something that would increase the likelihood of the supreme court weighing in. the lawsuit was filed in federa",3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.054665692150592804,0.7849039634068807,0.1604302947719892,0.2599481784985401,0,0,0,0,0.7798445354956203,-10.481303334451631,16.0,-0.655081458403227
Fury over Biden's new asylum policy grows after he thanks Poland for welcoming Ukrainian refugees,2023-02-23,72.0,"the split screen was striking. president joe biden in warsaw, poland, expressed unequivocal support for refugees borne out of russia's brutal invasion of ukraine. back home, his administration just hours later announced its toughest policy yet aimed at turning away migrants, many of whom are fleeing persecution and economic ruin in their home countries. from behind a podium adorning the iconic seal of the us presidency and in front of a set of american, ukrainian and polish flags, biden on tuesday had delivered a stirring message: america would forever stand with ukraine on the side of democracy and freedom. critical in that fight for freedom, biden said in remarks ahead of the one-year anniversary of russia's invasion of ukraine, was taking care of the millions of ukrainians whose homes, families and livelihoods have been destroyed over the last year. ""look at what you've done so far. poland is hosting more than 1.5 million refugees from this war. god bless you,"" biden told the crowd gathered at the royal castle. ""poland's generosity -- your willingness to open your hearts and your homes -- is extraordinary."" back at home, that show of appreciation to the polish people struck a nerve. while the two populations -- refugees fleeing war and asylum seekers -- are different, the contrast between biden's own words aimed at refugees in europe and his administration's newly announced policy on the us border did not go unnoticed among immigration and human rights advocates and democratic lawmakers alike, some of whom were quick to express their dismay. one senior democratic aide, who asked for anonymity to speak freely, bluntly described the situation as a ""real contradiction."" ""you see the president really highlighting how many refugees poland has taken,"" the aide said. ""and then on the same day, there's a rollout to very actively reduce the number of people who can even access our asylum system."" one immigration activist went as far as to say that they found some of biden's words in the warsaw speech ""deeply offensive,"" when heard in the context of his administration's new move to ban thousands of people -- fleeing persecution and hardships in their home countries -- from seeking asylum in the us. ""freedom. there is no sweeter word than freedom. there is no nobler goal than freedom,"" biden had said in warsaw. advocates have noted that some of the very modern protections that are in place for displaced people date back to the atrocities of world war ii. on tuesday afternoon, the homeland security and justice departments announced the administration's most restrictive policy yet aimed at curbing the number of migrants seeking to apply for asylum at the us-mexico border. the newly proposed rule -- which would take effect in may and is reminiscent of a controversial policy dating back to donald trump's administration -- largely bars migrants who traveled through other countries on their way to the us southern border from applying for asylum in the us. it marks a significant departure from longstanding protocol, which allows migrants to request asylum regardless of how they arrived on us soil. immigrant advocates and former biden officials have slammed the new policy, calling it a pivot from biden's pledge to restore asylum and a move toward trump-era policies. biden has long promised to take a humane approach to the situation at the border -- a promise that some critics say the current white house could risk breaking with some of their restrictive border policies. anu joshi, deputy director of the national political advocacy department at the american civil liberties union, said in a statement: ""this asylum ban is, at its core, trump's asylum ban under a different name."" administration officials have cited new programs that allow certain migrants to apply to come to the us and underscored efforts to expand access to legal pathways in their defense of the rule. the administration has also argued that the measure is part of a broader effort to establish order in an immigration system that has been under immense strain, and address migrants with valid claims of asylum, which are determined on a case-by-case basis. still, the announcement served yet another reminder of how the situation at the us border has proven to be one of the thorniest political problems for the biden white house. for the first half of the president's first term in office, biden and his top advisers grappled with title 42 -- a trump-era border restriction that the administration has both publicly criticized and leaned on to quell the flow of migrants arriving at the us border. the policy is the subject of ongoing litigation. with that policy set to expire in may, finding and enforcing other measures to restrict the thousands of migrants arriving at the us border has only grown in urgency for the white house -- particularly as republican lawmakers have been eager to paint biden as weak on border enforcement. but the patchwork of policies rolled out by the administration in recent weeks has put the president squarely at odds with his own allies. members of the congressional hispanic caucus had previously voiced frustration with the administration when officials previewed the rule last month, saying they were blindsided by the new border policies and disappointed over what they've said is a lack of direct engagement by the white house. the administration tried to correct course in private meetings last week with lawmakers about the anticipated release of the new asylum rule. but in one closed-door meeting with homeland security secretary alejandro mayorkas, democratic hispanic senators maintained their strong opposition and expressed their ongoing concerns, according to a source familiar with the meeting. among those in the room was democratic sen. bob menendez of new jersey. the senator -- who had previously written a letter to the president to share his concerns -- condemned the proposed asylum rule on tuesday in a joint statement with democratic sens. cory booker of new jersey, ben ray lujan of new mexico, and alex padilla of california. ""we are deeply disappointed that the administration has chosen to move forward with publishing this proposed rule, which only perpetuates the harmful myth that asylum seekers are a threat to this nation. in reality, they are pursuing a legal pathway in the united states,"" the statement said. ""we have an obligation to protect vulnerable migrants under domestic and international law and should not leave vulnerable migrants stranded in countries unable to protect them,"" it continued. in a statement, luis miranda, a homeland security spokesperson, said the proposal ""is part of a first-of-its-kind plan that expands legal pathways and has already reduced illegal immigration all while allowing thousands of individuals to lawfully enter the united states without having to put their lives in the hands of smugglers.""",4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.691021740436554,0.24070757627487183,0.06827069050632417,-0.9331388027497376,0,0,0,0,-3.7325552109989504,-13.213858545450583,19.0,-0.6954662392342412

First on CNN: Former Trump national security advisers among witnesses testifying at House hearing on China,2023-02-23,74.0,"the house select committee on china will feature four high-profile witnesses during its first hearing tuesday at 7 p.m. et, including former president donald trump's national security adviser, h.r. mcmaster, and top china expert and former deputy national security adviser, matthew pottinger, sources familiar with the hearing told cnn. this is the first primetime hearing that any gop-led committee has held since republicans took over the house majority in january. the panel's top republican, chairman mike gallagher of wisconsin, is hoping to make a splash with his witness list, which is aimed at proving his panel's commitment to leading a serious, bipartisan investigation that could result in substantial legislative action, the sources said. other witnesses include tong yi, former secretary to one of china's leading dissidents and current human rights activist, wei jingsheng, and scott paul, president of the alliance for american manufacturing. the witnesses will help the committee lay out what they view are the specific threats china poses as a global competitor, as well as the panel's top priorities on how to counter beijing's aggression. mcmaster and pottinger are significant witnesses for the committee to showcase. they are widely respected on both sides of the aisle and played key roles in how the trump administration formulated and carried out its agenda toward china. pottinger, in particular, worked for trump from the start of his administration until resigning in the immediate aftermath of the january 6, 2021, capitol riot. he testified publicly last year before the house select committee on the january 6 attack, earning him a nod of approval from the left. ""our national security was harmed in a different way by the sixth of january and that is, i think it emboldened our enemies by helping give them ammunition to feed a narrative that our system of government doesn't work, that the united states is in decline,"" pottinger said at the hearing. ""china, the putin regime in russia, tehran, they're fond of pushing those kinds of narratives -- and by the way, they're wrong."" meanwhile, tong will be a crucial witness who can speak personally to one of the committee's top priorities -- highlighting china's human rights abuses and why the us must do more to curb its global influence. tong was arrested and imprisoned for her involvement with jingsheng and the democracy movement in 1993, and was later released in 1996 before going into exile in the us. paul is expected to outline the reasoning for reducing beijing's role in the us economy and preventing american companies from ending up in the hands of chinese state-owned firms and investors. he's also been a leading voice on increasing domestic manufacturing, and can speak to why the panel believes the us must stop china's leverage at every angle. tuesday's hearing is the committee's first test to showcase what the panel is setting out to do: leading serious investigations in a bipartisan way that can get the backing of the majority of the public. both gallagher and illinois rep. raja krishnamoorthi, the committee's highest ranking democrat, have publicly touted the panel's efforts to remain bipartisan in tone and practice, and both have pointed to the types of members on the panel as proof that their work will be a departure from the highly politicized investigations other top committees are conducting. ""we're not going to turn this into a partisan, bomb-throwing committee,"" gallagher recently told cnn. ""now, there may be meaningful disagreement on the issues. there are plenty of areas where democrats and republicans disagree on china, but overall, i think everyone's trying to row in the same direction."" that commitment to bipartisanship, however, was recently tested by the controversial approach the biden administration took in handling the chinese spy balloon that recently flew over the us. how the committee addresses that approach will be a key sign of whether they can honor their vow to remain civil and work together. mcmaster and pottinger will likely take questions on tuesday about what the trump administration knew regarding the transiting of three suspected chinese spy balloons over the continental us during trump's time in office. committee aides told cnn to watch the line of questioning from different members as a sign of whether the panel can remain unified on the public stage. taiwan center stage while tuesday's hearing is expected to largely focus on china's human rights abuses, one of the most pressing issues the committee will ultimately delve into is how the us should defend taiwan against growing chinese aggression in the region. the hearing comes after a congressional delegation, led by select committee member democratic rep. ro khanna, traveled to taiwan where they met with top officials to discuss the threats posed by china. khanna worked extremely hard to ensure that this trip was not seen as overly provocative to china, focusing on the economic relationship and publicly stating his interest in visiting china as well, according to an aide, who noted that it was not cancelled in the wake of the chinese spy balloon incident because he believed it would send the wrong message. the congressman met with morris chang, the founder of taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company, who, according to the aide, typically does not meet with delegations, but wanted to meet with khanna because of his silicon valley ties and the role as a co-author of the chips and science act. addressing challenges posed by china's role in the semiconductor supply chain is a top priority for the china select committee and has bipartisan support, according to sources familiar with the matter. khanna told cnn in a phone interview wednesday that he hopes the committee will have the opportunity to hear directly from top officials like cia director bill burns and discuss strategies for avoiding conflict with china at a time of potentially increasing tensions. ""the committee is working in a way that is consistent with american foreign policy,"" he said, pointing to the work of former presidents richard nixon and jimmy carter that has ""stood the test of time for almost 50 years and avoided conflict in the straights."" ""it would behoove us to understand the rationale behind that policy, the delicate balance the us has managed to strike,"" khanna added, noting it would be helpful for the panel to address those topics, including the administration's policy related to taiwan, with burns and secretary of state antony blinken in particular. senior us national security officials, including burns, have increasingly warned that the chinese military has been ordered by president xi jinping to prepare for a potential invasion of taiwan -- a move that would dramatically escalate tensions and increase the risk of conflict with the us. ""we clearly see indications of xi instructing his military to be ready"" for an invasion later in this decade, burns said at the munich security conference, referring to taiwan. while ""that doesn't mean that an invasion is going to occur,"" it underscores how the ""risks increase the farther you get into this decade and beyond,"" he added.

Companies can no longer silence laid-off employees in exchange for severance,2023-02-22,75.0,"if your company lays you off, your employer might offer you severance pay — but only if you agree to adhere to a number of restrictions. staying quiet is often one of them. but the national labor relations board this week put employers on notice that they can no longer silence laid-off employees in two very specific ways that the board says violates employees' rights under sections 7 and 8(a)(1) of the national labor relations act. employers can no longer include a broadly written confidentiality clause that requires you to keep mum about the terms of your severance agreement. and they can no longer include a broadly written non-disparagement clause that prohibits you from discussing the terms and conditions of your employment with third parties. ""a severance agreement is unlawful if it precludes an employee from assisting coworkers with workplace issues concerning their employer, and from communicating with others, including a union, and the board, about his employment,"" the board wrote in its decision tuesday. the ruling is a reversal of what the trump-era nlrb members had decided in a prior case were lawful restrictions on employees as a condition of receiving severance. with the exception of railroads and airlines, us business employers are subject to the nlrb's authority. while the labor board's ruling this week could be appealed, the ruling is effective immediately. that means employers must review — and, if necessary, revise — their severance agreements to ensure they don't include overly broad language that would restrict workers' rights in the two ways the board ruling indicates. the board's decision will give back a bit of power to employees, but how it plays out remains to be seen. ""companies are definitely incentivized to silence their departing employees...[because it helps them keep] all the skeletons in the closet,"" employment attorney alex granovsky told cnn via email. ""this decision opens the door. while on the one hand sunlight is the best medicine, and greater exposure should lead to better companies, this decision could also change the dynamics of a severance negotiation."" -- cnn's chris isidore contribute to this report",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.16056697070598602,0.7916544675827026,0.04777855798602104,-0.27747423690232825,0,0,0,0,-0.27747423690232825,-3.493488454421268,13.0,-0.2687298811093283
Capitol rioter who tweeted threat to Rep. Ocasio-Cortez sentenced to 38 months in prison,2023-02-22,76.0,"a texas man was sentenced to more than three years in prison wednesday for assaulting police officers during the us capitol riot and threatening rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez on twitter shortly after the attack. garret miller, 36, pleaded guilty in december to charges related to his conduct on january 6, 2021. he was arrested weeks after the riot -- on inauguration day -- while wearing a shirt that said: ""i was there, washington, d.c., january 6, 2021."" according to court documents, miller brought gear with him to dc, including a rope, a grappling hook and a mouth guard, and prosecutors said he was ""at the forefront of every barrier overturned, police line overrun, and entryway breached within his proximity that day."" miller was detained twice during the riot, according to court documents. when he left the capitol building, he took the fight to twitter, according to court documents. in response to a tweet from ocasio-cortez calling for then-president donald trump's impeachment, miller responded: ""assassinate aoc."" ""at the time that i tweeted at the congresswoman, i intended that the communication be perceived as a serious intent to commit violence against the congresswoman,"" miller said in court documents as part of his guilty plea. he also levied threats against the officer who shot and killed a pro-trump rioter during the melee, according to court documents, saying that he wanted to ""hug his neck with a nice rope."" clint broden, miller's laywer, said in a statement to cnn that the sentence ""ultimately reflects judge nichols careful consideration of the case,"" and said that his client ""has expressed his sincere remorse for his actions."" correction: an earlier version of this story misstated the nature of garret miller's guilty plea.",2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.7484966218471527,0.23750689439475536,0.013996441673953086,-0.9889069113502624,0,0,0,0,-1.9778138227005249,-6.251146812617413,12.0,-0.5209289010514511
"CNN town hall on toxic train disaster in East Palestine, Ohio",2023-02-21,77.0,"our live coverage has ended. you can read more about today's town hall by scrolling through the posts below. residents of east palestine, ohio, asked their questions directly to officials during a cnn town hall — but were left with mixed feelings about the future of their town after a train carrying toxic chemicals derailed earlier this month. ""i don't believe what they'resaying,"" said resident nene stewart. jessica conard, who is a lifelong resident of the town, warned other communities in ohio and beyond. ""if you have a train near you ora waterway near you, this is aproblem for you too,"" she said. ""stand up, stand with us and we're gonna fight until thepromises are kept."" andris baltputnis, however, had a more optimistic view, saying, ""i was veryencouraged. everything was inthe positive direction and i think good things are on the horizon."" ""i feel confident to bet on ourselves. i think that's what i took today, we have the one opportunity in our life to rewrite the greatest comeback story in american history and we have the pen. so, if we're betting on us, i'm happy it's east palestine residents that get it,"" said dj yokley, another resident and small business owner. here are the other key moments from the town hall: safety assurances: experts doubled down on their reassurances that assessments of the air and water have come back normal so far. ohio gov. mike dewine said he felt it was safe enough to stay in the area overnight. epa administrator michael regan said while he understands the skepticism by families ""as a father,"" he would raise his children in the community based on air readings that indicate safe levels.health concerns: courtney newman, a mother and teacher in east palestine, ohio, said she has been experiencing a rash and her son has been getting bloody noses since returning to her home near the crash site. ohio department of health director dr. brucevanderhoff acknowledged that dealing with potential toxic exposures “may not be in the wheelhouse” of many physicians. he said toxicologists are available to provide expert advice and a clinic has been set up in the community to help people who may not have a doctor.norfolk southern: the rail company's ceo alan shaw apologized to east palestine residents for the train derailment disaster. he said the company is going to review the results of the ntsb's investigation as well as use data to ""figure out what we could've done better,"" though he declined to answer any questions about that investigation. shaw also said the company has already implemented new internal safety measures.ripping out tracks: shaw said norfolk southern plans to rip up the tracks where the train derailed and remove soil underneath. he said this effort is expected to start at the beginning of march. shaw said they will also continue to monitor testing from various agencies and contractors and are setting up groundwater testing in and around the site.small businesses: ohio's governor said he is working with federal officials to see what assistance they can provide to help small businesses in east palestine, but there has not been a concrete solution. dewine told a small business owner the most important thing they can do right now is to get the ""clean up done as fast as we can,"" adding that he spoke to president joe biden.fear and anger: jim stewart, who has lived in east palestine, ohio, for 65 years, said he is angry afterthe train derailmentearlier this month. speaking passionately and directly to shaw, stewart said norfolk southern took away his sense of safety. ""did you shorten my life, now?i want to retire and enjoy it.how are we gonna enjoy it?you burned me,"" he said. east palestine mayor trent conaway said, ""there's a lot of fears in town,"" especially from people who live close to the train tracks where the crash happened. he vowed to get answers to ease those anxieties. as wednesday's cnn town hall wrapped up, residents of east palestine gave their final thoughts to cnn's jake tapper. dj yokley, who was outspoken on small businesses and raising children in the village, said the residents of east palestine now have a chance to participate in a great recovery story after the train derailment earlier this month. ""as a leader in the community, watching leaders across our state and our federal, i feel confident to bet on ourselves,"" yokley said, noting that the east ohio town had a chance to write ""the greatest comeback story in american history."" he added: ""if we're betting on us, i'm happy it's east palestine residents that get it."" norfolk southern ceo alan shaw declined to answer questions regarding the ongoing national transportation safety board investigation or details relating to what caused the train derailment. ""i'm prohibited from talking about the ongoing investigation,"" shaw said. ""what i can do and what i am doing and the commitment that i'm making is we're going to get the environmental cleanup right. we're going to support the citizens and the family members here and we're going to invest in the longterm growth of this community and help east palestine thrive."" he said he is looking forward to the investigation's findings. jim stewart, who has lived in east palestine, ohio, for 65 years, said he no longer feels safe in his town after the train derailment earlier this month. ""i'm angry about this,"" he told norfolk southern ceo alan shaw. ""i don't feel safe in this townnow, you took it away from me.you took this away from us,"" stewart said. he said he lives very close to the derailment site and although there has been testing of the air quality around his property he said he is ""afraid to put my dog out just to pee."" stewart said he feels a sense of loss and he worries about the value of his home and his ability to retire in the coming years. ""i don't call it a derailment, i call it a disaster,"" stewart said. ""did you shorten my life, now?i want to retire and enjoy it.how are we gonna enjoy it?you burned me,"" he said. he talked about the uncertainty of if it is safe to do things around his home, from mowing the grass to planting vegetables. in response, shaw said he is going to ""make it right"" by cleaning up the chemicals, reimbursing residents and making investments to improve the safety of trains. watch: since the train derailment earlier this month, norfolk southern ceo alan shaw said the company has already implemented new safety measures to prevent future incidents. shaw said that ""in the immediate aftermath,"" the company has tested and calibrated wayside detectors across its system and said it will continue to do so. when asked by a resident if safety measures would be made public, shaw said ""it is an internal component to norfolk southern."" another resident pushed back, asking ""don't you think people would want to see that happening?"" shaw answered, saying the company ""can certainly take videos"" of new safety measures being implemented and post them. alan shaw, norfolk southern ceo, said the company plans to take a series of measures moving forward to minimize the long-term impacts of chemicals on the land and groundwater, including ripping up the tracks where the train derailed and removing soil underneath. he said ""we've exited the emergency phase"" and are now working with the environmental protection agency on a ""long-term remediation plan."" initially, shaw said they felt like they had an ""environmentally sound plan based on engineering principles"" to deal with the soil where the chemicals spilled, but after pushback from the community, norfolk southern decided to remove the tracks completely. he said this effort is expected to start at the beginning of march. shaw said they will also continue to monitor testing from various agencies and contractors and are setting up groundwater testing in and around the site. norfolk southern ceo alan shaw apologized to east palestine residents for the train derailment disaster. ""i'm terribly sorry for what has happened to your community,"" he said during the cnn town hall wednesday night. ""i want you to know that norfolksouthern is here, and we're goingto stay here.and we're going to make this right."" he said the company is going to review the results of the ntsb's investigation as well as using data to ""figure out what we could've done better."" ""there's always more that we can do,"" he said. ""and i'm committed to making norfolk southern a safer railroad."" east palestine, ohio, mayor trent conaway is calling for answers to ease fears in the community following the derailment of a train carrying toxic chemicals. ""there's a lot of fears in town,"" especially from people who live close to the train tracks where the crash happened, he said. ""they're justified and they need answers,"" conaway said during the cnn town hall. ""and we'll get those answers."" he said he is cautiously optimistic that the community will bounce back, pointing to assurances from officials and experts. ""this is going to be a very longprocess, and you know, eventually, hopefully it comes to an end and hopefully it goes back tothe way it was, and actually better than theway it was. that's our main goal,"" conaway said. while he said he understands the hesitation of east palestine, ohio, residents to bring their families back to their homes, environmental protection agency administrator michael regan said he would raise his children in the community. ""yes, i would based on theevidence that we have,"" he said in response to a question from town resident dj yokley, who asked if regan would feel safe raising his kids in east palestine. ""i understand the skepticism, as a father. i'm a father first and foremost, i understand the skepticism, but what i can tell you is what the science tells us and that these readings are indicating that there are safe levels,"" regan said. regan laid out various types of air monitoring the epa has been doing around the site where a train carrying toxic chemicals derailed. this includes an airplane, a mobile van moving in and out of the area and several air quality monitors placed ""strategically all around the community."" he said his agency has tested the air quality inside more than 550 home and are working with state officials to test the water. ""what the science tells us isthat we haven't had anyreadings that are above certainlevels that would cause adversehealth impacts,"" regan said. norfolk southern has been ordered by the environmental protection agency to fully clean up its toxic train wreck and pay for the fallout in east palestine, ohio. epa administrator michael regan told cnn wednesday the company will take care of the incident ""in a very prescribed manner on a specific timeframe."" here's what that looks like: according to special authority by the epa, norfolk southern is required to provide the agency with a descriptive cleanup plan for contaminated soil and water as well as debris, regan said.the company will also reimburse the epa for providing all east palestine residents with an interior and exterior cleaning service of their homes and businesses. norfolk southern representatives will also be compelled to ""show up at epa's request to public meetings and explain and talk to the residents about what they're doing during this process.""and should norfolk southern fail to meet the epa's orders, regan said the agency will ""step in"" and could charge the company up to three times the amount that the cleanup would cost. ""there are a lot of incentives built in here, in this order, to compel the company to clean up their mess,"" he said. ohio's governor said he is working with federal officials to see what assistance they can provide to help small businesses in east palestine, ohio, recover after a train carrying toxic chemicals derailed in the town. dj yokley, a small business owner in east palestine, ohio, pressed ohio gov. mike dewine on the issue saying businesses were ""affected overnight."" yokley, who is the founder and ceo of your sports network, told the governor that businesses need a plan to ""be open at full capacity."" dewine said he talked to president joe biden about what to do to assist small businesses, but there wasn't a concrete solution. ""i'm not sure what we can do, but we're certainly going to look at that and see if there is anything, certainly, that we can do,"" he said, adding that it is a ""tough time"" for the community.""probably the most important thing we can do is get the clean up done as fast as we can,"" dewine said. he said he hopes this gives residents more confidence. ""it's not going to happen overnight,"" dewine said. yokley responded to dewine saying he understands the cleanup will not be a quick turnaround. ""we understand it's not going tohappen overnight.our businesses were builtovernight, but they wereaffected overnight, sir,"" yokley said. ""i think the biggest thing is there's a lot of people in the town — business owners as well — that need either to get back in thegame or get out of town.i would love to stay in my town,but obviously we need to be ableto be open at full capacity."" ohio gov. mike dewine said he will tell the residents of east palestine ""the best information"" regarding the incident in an attempt to alleviate their skepticism. ""sometimes we don't know all the information,"" he said. ""sometimes we get facts that maybe are wrong – but there's no way in the world i'm going to convey to you or to any other citizen a fact that i think is wrong."" ohio gov. mike dewine said he would stay in east palestine, ohio, overnight until the clean up is done. resident ben ratner pressed the governor about having been to the site of the toxic train derailment for only a few hours at a time, dewine was insistent he felt it was safe to stay in the area overnight. many people who live in the area have been anxious about returning to their homes and the potential long-term effects on the air and water, though experts have said assessments have come back normal so far. here's how the exchange played out: ratner: ""would you stay in east palestine?""dewine: ""yes.""ratner: ""until the clean up is done, you'll stay with us, within the 1 mile?""dewine: ""yes. yes, i have been there three times.""ratner: ""for a few hours. will you stay overnight for a period of time?""dewine: ""yeah.""ratner: ""ok. hopefully we hold you to that."" courtney newman, a mother and teacher in east palestine, ohio, said she has been having some health issues after returning to her home after a train carrying toxic chemicals derailed her house. she said she lives a street away from the crash site. her family was evacuated, but once that order was lifted and she came back to her house, she noticed that her son had been getting bloody noses every day. newman said she was also seeing rashes on herself. ""i took him to the pediatricianon friday.i was told they had no guidancefrom the cdc, the healthdepartment —there was nothing they could do,"" she said. newman said doctors told her they were ""in the dark as much as you are."" ohio department of health director dr. brucevanderhoff acknowledged that dealing with potential toxic exposures “may not be in the wheelhouse” of many physicians. he said if anyone feels like they are not able to get the evaluation they feel they need, the state is making additional resources available. patients can ask their doctor to call the county health department to get connected to toxicologists who can provide expert advice, according to vanderhoff. the health department also set up a clinic to help residents who may not have a doctor or just need additional support, he said. for context: cnn is sharing the stories of ohio residents who tell us their health has been impacted by the norfolk southern train derailment. from a medical perspective, definitively linking chemicals to health effects – such as a rash, headache or nausea – is challenging. in some cases, it could take years to establish a definitive connection, or it turn out that one does not exist. nene stewart, an east palestine resident, is relying on water bottles because she still is unsure about the safety of her home's water. ""i'm not trusting what they are saying,"" stewart told ohio gov. mike dewine wednesday evening. ""so, i don't know who is telling the truth."" according to the environmental protection agency, municipal water sample results in the city have shown ""no water quality concerns."" dewine told stewart that ""we've been very careful not to tell anybody it's ok until we have evidence that it is okay."" he said officials advised residents not to use village water or water from an individually-owned well. ""we think it's ok,"" he said. ""but we are not going to know until we test that.""""look, there's still cleanup to do,"" he added. ""there's still many things to do, so we're not telling you everything is perfect."" ohio gov. mike dewine assured residents of east palestine, ohio, that state officials and other experts intend to stay in the town until the toxic chemicals from a train derailment earlier this month are cleaned up. ""there's a concern you will be left on your own,"" dewine said in response to a question about what the future holds for east palestine, saying some people are anxious that experts will leave when national attention on the issue fades. ""we're gonna stay in there ... and do what needs to be done,"" he added. the governor said he is making a commitment to those who live there and that officials are going to do ""everything we can so that you have a great future and your children have a great future."" a fiery train wreck that released toxic materials in an ohio town is raising new questions in the halls of the nation’s capital over the regulation of the rail industry and if stricter measures could have prevented the disaster. news of the derailment in east palestine, ohio – and its potentially harmful effects on the environment and health of local residents – has propelled both democrats and republicans in congress to press the biden administration on whether there’s enough oversight to keep rail workers and communities near railroads safe. and the supervising agency broadly responsible for regulating rail safety, the department of transportation, is calling on congress to make it easier to institute safety reforms. this rare, general bipartisan agreement about taking action in the wake of the derailment follows years of republicans generally supporting deregulation of the rail industry, including with the broadrollback of transportation rulesduring the trump administration. experts point out several areas of opportunity to enhance rail safety and hold rail companies further accountable: updating trains’ braking systems, shortening the lengths of freight trains, further separating cars with hazardous material, requiring more crew members to be on board and increasing penalties. many of these proposals, experts say, have been around for decades, and have oftentimes been diminished or entirely eliminated after rail lobbying efforts. data compiled by the nonprofit opensecrets show that norfolk southern, the company involved in the ohio derailment,spent $1.8 million on federal lobbying last year. bipartisan efforts in congress: congressional committees are set to review the environmental and safety impacts of the east palestine derailment. although efforts to enhance regulatory oversight of the rail industry have generally broken along party lines, some republicans and democrats appear to be moving in the same direction. house transportation and infrastructure committee chair sam graves, a missouri republican, scheduled a bipartisan briefing for members of the committee last week. read more here the ceo of norfolk southern, the head of the environmental protection agency, as well as ohio gov. mike dewine are participating in tonight's cnn town hall. for weeks, residents have reporteda variety of health problemssince the norfolk southern train carrying toxic chemicals derailed in early february, spewing black clouds of smoke over the community of about 5,000 people in eastern ohio. to help prevent a deadly explosion of vinyl chloride, crewsreleased the toxic chemical into a trench and burned it off. earlier on wednesday, epa administrator michael regan threatened expensive consequences if norfolk southern fails to fully clean up its toxic train wreck and pay for the fallout in east palestine. while the epa says testing shows the air and municipal water are safe, regan said those with symptoms they believe might be linked to the wreck should “seek medical attention.” those residents should “ensure that the state and local health agencies understand those experiences because as we force norfolk southern to take full accountability for what they’ve done, norfolk southern will pay for everything,” regan said. cnn's nouran salahieh,holly yanandclaire colbert contributed reporting to this post. a senate hearing on the toxic train derailment and cleanup ineast palestine, ohio, is expected to be held in early march, two senate sources familiar with the plan told cnn. in addition to health and safety concerns, the hearing is expected to focus on the timeline of state and federal environmental protection agency response to the incident, one source told cnn. last week, sens. tom carper of delaware and shelley moore capito of west virginiaannounced they would hold a hearing on the derailment without setting a date. carper, a democrat, is chairman of the environment and public works committee and capito, a republican, is a ranking member of the committee. carper and capito said in a statement the hearing would “examine the local, state and federal response in the immediate aftermath of the train derailment and the ongoing efforts to clean up toxic chemicals in the surrounding environment.” pennsylvania gov. josh shapiro alleged tuesday that norfolk southern gave inaccurate information and conflicting data to government officials in regard to the ohio train derailment that occurred earlier this month. he said he has “serious concerns” with norfolk southern’s “failed management of this crisis"" at a tuesday afternoon news conference ineastpalestine, ohio. “they chose not to participate in the unified command,"" shapiro said. ""they gave us inaccurate information and conflicting modeling data, and they refused to explore or articulate alternative courses of action when we were dealing with the derailment in the early days.""“in sum, norfolk southern injected unnecessary risk into this crisis,” the democratic governor added. he said he will hold the company accountable for its actions. “the combination of norfolk southern’s corporate greed, incompetence, and lack of care for our residents is absolutely unacceptable to me,” shapiro said. when asked what non-financial actions are being taken against the company for the incident, shapiro said his state’s department of environmental protection has made a “criminal referral” to the attorney general’s office. ohio gov. mike dewine said his attorney general is reviewing the possible legal action against norfolk southern as well on tuesday. “the ohio attorney general will take whatever action that ohio law allows him to take,” dewine said after shapiro spoke. “and i know he’s reviewing this right now.” norfolk southern ceo alan shaw, who is scheduled to take part in wednesday's cnn town hall, defended his company’s actions since the disaster caused by the derailment of one of its trains in east palestine, ohio, and promised the railroad will pay for the cleanup. “norfolk southern is committed to the community and citizens of east palestine,” shaw told cnn on tuesday. “we’re going to be here today, we’re going to be here tomorrow, we’re going to be here a year from now and we’re going to be here five years from now.” shaw said the company has already paid out $6.5 million to citizens living near the site of thederailment that took place february 3. shaw said the railroad has been in agreement with the actions of the environmental protection agency (epa) and local efforts on the ground in east palestine since the train derailment. shaw said norfolk southern has been coordinating with the ohio epa and local officials and, so far, has been very present in the community since the february 3 accident. he said he first came to east palestine in the immediate aftermath of the accident and visited a family assistance center that the company put in place, where he checked in on residents, making sure they had everything that they needed. “from day one i’ve made the commitment that norfolk southern is going to remediate the site,” shaw said. “we’re going to do it through continuous long-term air and water monitoring. we’re going to help the residents of this community recover and we’re going to invest in the long-term health of this community and we’re going to make norfolk southern a safer railroad.” transportation secretarypete buttigiegwill visit the site of the train derailment in east palestine, ohio, on thursday. the secretary has come under intense pressure from east palestine residents and other critics to visit the town in the wake of the february 3 derailment of a norfolk southern train that released toxic chemicals. he told reporters earlier this week that he would visit “when the time is right” but was deferring to the national transportation safety board and its investigation first. an administration official told cnn that the time is now appropriate for buttigieg to go to east palestine. “the secretary is going now that the epa has said it is moving out of the emergency response phase and transitioning to the long-term remediation phase. his visit also coincides with the ntsb issuing its factual findings of the investigation into the cause of the derailment and will allow the secretary to hear from usdot investigators who were on the ground within hours of the derailment to support the ntsb’s investigation,” the official said. in response to criticism, buttigieg said in an interview on cbs news’ “red and blue"" that he “could have spoken out sooner” about the incident, and that it was a “lesson learned.” he said he has been “respecting the role that the independent ntsb plays and staying out of their way” but does plan to visit east palestine where he will be “focused on action, not on politics, not on show.” ohio gov. mike dewine and epa administrator michael regan visited the homes ofeastpalestineresidents on tuesday to listen to their concerns and conduct air quality tests. the visit comes after municipal water sample results in the city showed ""no water quality concerns,"" according to the epa. the officials first visited resident carolyn brown's home, where they poured two glasses of water from her tap and took a sip. during the visit, regan promised transparency, saying that “we will continue to show up.” they then went to the home ofeastpalestineresident andris baltputnis, a former chemistry teacher. again, they drank water from his tap. “we are in this for the long haul,” the governor told baltputnis. the resident said assurance and reassurance in the community are good, and he “couldn’t hardly ask for anything more.” the officials performed an air quality reading at baltputnis’ home, showing the reading for the toxins in the air as zero. cnn answers six key questions on the derailment of the train carrying hazardous material earlier in february: why are hazardous materials transported by train? this is in large part because railroads are considered the safest mode of transportation to carry large amounts of hazardous materials, including chemicals, for long distances across the country, according to thefederal railroad administration. america’s freight trains moved 2.2 million carloads of chemicals in 2021,according to theassociation of american railroads. how often does this kind of incident happen? federal rail administration data provided to cnn showed 149 incidents where hazardous materials were released from moving trains over the past decade. it’s important to note the federal data is being self-reported by train companies, making it tough to verify all the information is accurate. how do officials measure the damage and impact? ohio environmental protection agency officials have been conducting air, soil and water tests since the controlled explosion of the chemicals inside the rail cars. the epa said tuesday there were chemicals spilled into the local waterways that lead to the ohio river, but that much of it was contained. an initial plume of chemicals that was spilled into the waterway had made it to the ohio river, but officials said they exist in very low concentration, and they are working with water facilities on enhanced filtration so they are not passed onto water customers. that said, epa and ohio state officials urged residents in east palestine to continue to drink bottled water for now. if animals are dying, what does that mean for humans? the chemical spill took a severe toll on local aquatic life: about 3,500 fish ranging across 12 species died from the water contamination washing down streams and rivers. anecdotal reports of pets and chickens dying have not yet been confirmed by officials. mary mertz, the director of ohio’s department of natural resources, said tuesday there’s no evidence that non-aquatic species have been affected by the spill. what goes into cleaning up? ohio epa and state officials have done several different things to try to contain pollution from the chemical spill. crews have put oil containment booms in waterways and aerated contaminated soil and water.crews have excavated and removed nearly 500 cubic yards of “vinyl chloride-impacted material” including soil, according to kurt kollar, the on-scene coordinator for the ohio epa’s office of emergency response. the epa is blocking off ditches around the contaminated dirt so that it doesn’t contaminate more water.the epa also said it has collected and stored nearly one million gallons of water in containers. officials said water treatment facilities should be able to remove the remaining low levels of volatile organic compounds in the water, and that the water will eventually be safe to drink. what are the possible long-term impacts? in addition to the chemicals officials say should break down with aeration and water treatment, environmental officials also need to test for pfas –a long-lastingand potentially more worrying class of chemicals used to put out chemical fires. pfas is typically found on non-stick pans and in some firefighting foams. read more details here. top officials from the state ofohio,norfolk southernand theenvironmental protection agencywill take part incnn'stownhallwednesdaynight. ohiogov. mike dewine,epa administratormichael regan and alan shaw, theceoofnorfolksouthern,are all settotake part in thetownhall, which airs at 9 p.m. et and will be moderated by jake tapper. additionally, several local and state officials, including anne vogel, director of theohioepaand dr. bruce vanderhoff, the director of theohio department of health. this post has been updated with the latest details on those who will take part in the town hall. a norfolk southern train with more than 100 cars derailed ineast palestine, ohio, on february 3, sparking a massive fire and prompting evacuation orders. there were 20 cars with hazardous material in the train – 10 of which derailed. five of the tankers were carrying liquid vinyl chloride, which is extremely combustible. the wreckage burned for days in the town, which is located about 15 miles south of youngstown, as authorities worried about the possibility of a widespread, deadly explosion. but crews managed controlled detonations to release the chemical, which can kill quickly at high levels and increase cancer risk. the hazardous substance spilled into a trench, where it was burned away. officials issued a shelter-in-place order for the entire town of roughly 5,000 people, while the evacuation order was in effect for days for those within a mile of the train incident. authorities have since assured residents that any immediate danger has passed as they lifted the evacuation order for those living in east palestine. real-time air readings, which use handheld instruments to broadly screen for classes of contaminants like volatile organic compounds, showed the air quality near the site was within normal limits. still, people who live in east palestine want to know about the chemical threats that may linger. some residents havereported health problems, andabout 3,500 fish have died in ohio waterwayssince the wreck. officials are investigating the incident's cause as site cleanup and monitoring could take years, according to the ohio environmental protection agency. a source familiar with the investigation tells cnn the ntsb will issue its initial findings on thursday. approximately 15 cars remain at the derailment site, where they are on an ntsb hold, according to connor spielmaker, a spokesperson for norfolk southern. ohio officials say the soil under the tracks is still contaminated and that the tracks will eventually be lifted to remove that soil. the ohio environmental protection agency is aware of the contaminated soil, and according to ohio gov. mike dewine, 4,588 cubic yards of soil and 1.1 million gallons of contaminated water have been removed thus far. roughly 21 miles before it derailed, a norfolk southern train slowed down dramatically after showing the first signs of potential wheel bearing overheat, according to a cnn analysis of surveillance video and documents from the department of transportation. the train had been traveling at an average speed of 49 mph between alliance, ohio and salem, ohio. it took 16 minutes for the train to travel 13 miles. in alliance, surveillance video did not show any signs of overheat. however, in salem, surveillance video showed bright lights and sparks emanating from the train's wheelset — the signs of a potential wheel bearing overheat. between salem and east palestine, the train slowed dramatically, averaging a speed of just 29 mph until it derailed. it took 44 minutes for the train to travel about 21 miles. documents filed in 2020 with the federal railroad authority give context to the abnormality of that slowdown.the ""typical speed range"" for a train traveling along this stretch of track is between 40 and 60 miles per hour. the revelation that the train's average speed decreased by around 20 mph in the roughly 40 minutes before it derailed draws more questions about whether the train's crew was alerted to any potential issues — like a wheel-bearing overheat. norfolk southern, like all railroad companies, utilizes hot box detectors to alert train crews and dispatchers of overheat issues. an online database of hot box detectors radio recordings, compiled and maintained by radio and rail enthusiasts, indicates norfolk southern has a hot box detector in salem, just past where surveillance video captured the train's apparent wheel bearing overheat. the company also has two other hot box detectors on the line, one in colombiana, ohio, and in east palestine. cnn was able to calculate the average speed of the train by utilizing surveillance video time stamps that showed the train's positions at specific points on the track. the national transportation safety board (ntsb) said it is investigating surveillance video that may show ""what appears to be a wheel bearing in the final stage of overheat failure moments before the derailment."" jennifer gabris, a ntsb spokesperson, told cnn that ""this information will be part of the preliminary report that will be released [thursday] at 10 a.m."" michael regan, the environmental protection agency administrator, said tuesday the agency will supporteastpalestineas it enters a cleanup phase,and will continueto hold norfolk southern accountable for its actions. “but let me also be crystal clear – norfolk southern will pay for cleaning up the mess that they created and the trauma that they inflicted on this community and impacted beaver county residents,” regan said at a news conference. using epa’s legal authorities, regan said he ordered norfolk southern to clean up all contaminated soil and water and safely transport that contamination to the appropriate locations. that work will be done to epa specifications, regan added, and said norfolk southern will reimburse epa for cleaning services. he said he is also ordering norfolk southern to attend and participate in public meetings and share information with the public. if norfolk southern fails to complete any action ordered by the epa, the agency will conduct the work itself and then force norfolk southern to pay triple in cost, regan said. “in no way, shape or form will norfolk southern get off the hook for the mess that they created,” regan said. regan added he has “absolute confidence” in the agency’s air and water quality testing data. “our data is very solid,” regan said. “and we believe that in our partnership with the state, that we have absolute confidence. and if the homes have been cleared and tested for drinking water, then we trust that data. we feel really good about that.” state and federal officials held a news conference last week in east palestine, ohio, as residents expressed frustrationabout the response to a train carrying potentially deadly materials that derailed in their hometown nearly three weeks ago. michael s. regan, the head of the us environmental protection agency, aimed to reassure residents that authorities are focused on keeping them safe. regan arrived in east palestine on february 16 to assess the ongoing response. “this incident has understandably shaken this community to its core,"" regan said. ""the community has questions and they deserve answers. i want the community to know that we hear you, we see you, and that we will get to the bottom of this."" the evacuation order issued after a days-long blaze was lifted on february 8 after air and water samples led officials to deem the area safe. “epa has assisted with the screening of more than 480 homes under the voluntary screening program offered to residents. and no detections of vinyl chloride or hydrogen chloride were identified. and we’re continuing to make those screenings available to any resident that wants to have their indoor air tested,"" regan said. the agency has full authority to use its enforcement capabilities over the crisis and it will stay there ""as long as it takes"" to ensure the community's safety, he added.

"Exclusive: North Korea a 'clear and present danger,' says South Korean Foreign Minister",2023-02-22,78.0,"north korea is a ""clear and present danger,"" the foreign minister of south korea has told cnn in an exclusive interview. kim jong un's frequent missile tests and repeated warnings that he would consider using tactical nuclear weapons were a display of aggression and the only way to counter this was through extended us deterrence, foreign minister park jin said on wednesday. ""what north korea is doing is completely wrong,"" park said. ""they have been escalating nuclear and missile threats, and threatening the peace and stability on the korean peninsula and northeast asia."" in just the past week, north korea has tested an intercontinental ballistic missile, which in theory could be used to strike almost anywhere in the world, and nuclear-capable long-range multiple rocket launchers -- the equivalent of short-range ballistic missiles -- which could hit anywhere in south korea. those followed a record year of missile testing in 2022, when pyongyang tested missiles on 37 days, according to cnn's count, all in violation of united nations security council resolutions. after the rocket launches on monday, kim yo jong, kim jong un's sister, warned of more missile tests to come unless the united states halts military drills with south korea, threatening to make the pacific ocean ""our shooting range."" but park suggested such belligerence would only strengthen south korea's alliance with the us. ""us extended deterrence"" is ""the only way that we can effectively protect our country from the north korean aggression,"" park said, adding that enhancing that deterrence would involve ""effective deployment of us strategic assets"" as well as exercises and training. on the same day as park was speaking, guided-missile destroyers from both countries were joined by another from japan in a ballistic missile defense exercise in the waters between japan and the korean peninsula. park offered little hope for any early easing of tensions with north korea, saying there are no active negotiations and that kim would not give up his nuclear weapons voluntarily. the north korean leader must be made to see that talks are his only option, park said. ""we have to create an environment where north korea has no choice but to come back to the negotiation table,"" he said. experience had shown that kim would not negotiate when he sensed weakness in his opponents, park said, citing failed negotiations that occurred during the administration of former us president donald trump. ""the lesson we learned is that when we are strong ... north korea comes to the dialogue table. when we are weak, they try to take advantage of that vulnerability. so we have to prepare ourselves through our defense and also through deterrence to talk with the north,"" he said. park also said south korea's security challenges extend beyond the korean peninsula, including a thousand miles to the south across the taiwan strait. ""peace and stability in the taiwan strait is essential for peace and stability on the korean peninsula, and it's indispensable for security and prosperity of the region as a whole,"" park said. china's ruling communist party has for months been pressuring the self-ruled island of taiwan. it sees the island as part of its territory, despite never having controlled it, and chinese leader xi jinping has repeatedly refused to rule out the use of force in ""reunifying"" it with the chinese mainland. park said that could have a ""direct impact"" on south korea. ""we are opposed to unilateral change of (the) status quo by force. so in that sense, we will make sure that if something happens in the taiwan strait, we have to maintain peace and stability on the korean peninsula."" he said.",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.8620590567588806,0.12848512828350067,0.009455738589167595,-0.9999999999940647,0,0,0,0,-0.9999999999940647,-2.555083514462212,9.0,-0.2838981682735791
"Ohio's toxic spill is unleashing poisonous, partisan politics",2023-02-23,79.0,"the people of east palestine, ohio, just want help, truth and accountability after a freight train wreck smothered their town with a toxic cloud and left them afraid to drink the water. ""i don't feel safe, because i don't know what the future holds for my town,"" said lifelong east palestine resident jessica conard during a wednesday evening cnn town hall. her comment encapsulated a remarkable and pervasive feeling of mistrust among residents toward assurances by state and federal officials that their air and water are safe. ""this has the potential to really decimate a small town like us,"" conard added. a massive clean-up is underway, officials are testing local water systems, wells, streams and creeks, and multiple investigations are beginning. but these ohioans in the epicenter of an environmental crisis, which suddenly arrived on their doorsteps on february 3, are also becoming political extras on an early stage for gop white house candidates like former president donald trump. whenever disaster strikes in divided america, toxic politics isn't far behind, and derailments -- like hurricanes, industrial accidents and transportation meltdowns -- come with a political scorecard that adversaries leverage to try to damage those in power. republicans are using the derailment to claim that while president joe biden is lavishing billions on ukrainians he visited in a daring trip to wartime kyiv this week, he is neglecting needy americans back home. ""you are not forgotten,"" trump said after traveling to east palestine on wednesday -- although lacking the power of his former office, he has more capacity to boost his slow-moving 2024 campaign than to fix the disaster. the train wreck is also a fresh hazard for a democratic rising star, pete buttigieg. the former presidential democratic candidate's role as transportation secretary offers a valuable platform ahead of possible future campaigns. but it also carries the risk of a political blow every time something goes wrong with america's accident-prone infrastructure. buttigieg, who is headed to ohio thursday, admits he could have spoken out about east palestine sooner and has promised to learn his lesson. he'll now travel there the same day a preliminary national transportation safety board report into the causes of the derailment is set to be released. republicans sense vulnerability. ""he is an incompetent who is focused solely on his fantasies about his political future & needs to be fired,"" tweeted florida sen. marco rubio, who, like buttigieg, might also have another white house race in his future. the ohio disaster is also allowing the public a glimpse into the rarely seen washington duel between regulators and freight firms, which has huge implications for keeping americans safe as vast trains -- some as long as 150 cars, some carrying poisonous chemicals -- rumble through towns and cities. trump might be posing as a savior now, but he presided over a slashing of environmental and safety regulations in office. huge transportation firms, meanwhile, pay lobbyists millions of dollars to loosen safety rules and staffing levels as they seek to maximize profits, even while rewarding shareholders and scrimping on safety. still, perhaps the consequences of the derailment could unlock unusual coalitions in washington. conservative republican sen. ted cruz of texas and progressive democratic rep. ilhan omar of minnesota are both demanding reforms, for instance. but in washington, expectations of bipartisan action after a catastrophe often wane as time passes. mistrust in local, state and federal leaders is rampant given the political hypocrisy on show, the sometimes slow-moving machinery of a government disaster response, and the complex layers of federal, state and local responsibility, it's no wonder residents question whether they are being heard. their concerns are only exacerbated by the fact that hazardous smoke that rose over their homes followed a controlled burn of several wagons containing chemicals, which was ordered by officials to forestall an even worse disaster -- a massive explosion. residents of the town of 5,000 people complained of medical conditions like rashes, sore throats, bloody noses and other ailments and found thousands of dead fish in creeks. locals want quicker action from state and federal leaders, question officials' assurances their water was safe and feel overpowered by norfolk southern, the multi-billion dollar railroad firm that was responsible for the train that derailed. a response that some saw as sluggish has ramped up. the biden administration is now forcing norfolk southern to pay for the clean-up operation and to compensate the government for its expenses. yet many townspeople mistrust officials who tell them they are in no danger, contrasting the evidence of their own senses with what they are being told. trump leaps at a political opening one person's plea for help is another's political opening. trump may have brought some comfort to people in a region that voted for him overwhelmingly with his visit on wednesday, but it was still a partisan political play. ""i sincerely hope that when your representatives and all of the politicians get here, including biden, they get back from touring ukraine, that he's got some money left over,"" trump said in east palestine, in columbiana county, which he won with 72% of the vote over the current president in the 2020 election. ""we stayed with you, we pray for you and we will stay with you,"" trump said, despite having no capacity to direct the government response. his attack on biden did, however, underscore his ""america first"" mantra. in response, biden tweeted about the disaster while in europe, blaming his predecessor's administration for making it harder to implement rail safety measures and telling residents, ""we've got your back."" trump pledged bottled water sourced from his hotels and bought burgers for firefighters in a local mcdonald's as he adopted the trappings of a presidential post-disaster visit to polish his own political profile. he boasted how he had deployed the federal emergency management agency -- which is currently operating in east palestine -- during his presidency. he didn't mention his own criticized disaster mismanagement, however, after hurricane maria devastated puerto rico in 2017 or during the covid-19 pandemic. trump sidestepped a question over his role in weakening safety standards after he repealed an obama administration rule requiring freight railroads to employ electronically controlled pneumatic brakes on certain trains hauling hazardous and flammable cargos. the measure wouldn't have stopped the east palestine disaster since the train that derailed there didn't have sufficient cars of such a type that would have triggered the rule had it still been in force. but critics have charged that trump's slashing of such rules and his elimination of regulations across the board made railroads and americans less safe. other current and potential republican presidential candidates rushed to catch up with trump. former south carolina gov. nikki haley asked whether biden shouldn't be ""with those people in ohio."" haley's attack seemed inconsistent with her vow to be tougher than biden on russian president vladimir putin. after all, the president traveled to europe around the anniversary of the russian invasion to warn putin would never win the war. and former vice president mike pence, who might also run in 2024, said he was ""glad"" that biden went to ukraine ""but he should have gone to east palestine first."" buttigieg navigates another tough political spot given his political profile, buttigieg is one of the most famous transportation secretaries in modern history. he's been thrust into the spotlight during travel meltdowns in the aviation industry -- during weather-related shutdowns and during the chaos triggered by southwest's scheduling nightmare last year. republicans blame the former south bend, indiana, mayor for every transportation mess. in response, he has positioned himself as the champion of the victims. in the case of the ohio train wreck, for example, he wrote this week to alan shaw, the head of norfolk southern, bemoaning the way the derailment had ""upended the lives of numerous residents."" ""the people of east palestine cannot be forgotten, nor can they be simply considered the cost of doing business,"" buttigieg wrote in the letter, which was clearly designed for an audience wider than shaw. buttigieg also admitted wednesday that he ""could have spoken out sooner"" regarding the derailment. ""i was focused on just making sure that our folks on the ground were all set but could have spoken sooner about how strongly i felt about this incident and that's a lesson learned for me,"" buttigieg said on cbs news' ""red & blue."" buttigieg said he had been ""respecting the role that the independent ntsb plays and staying out of their way"" but vowed to be ""focused on action, not on politics, not on show"" when he visits east palestine. now that biden is back on us soil, the odds of him making his own visit -- to empathize with townspeople and to show he's on top of the response -- must be rising. such trips are often about perception. but the presence of a commander in chief does galvanize the government like nothing else and assure those hit by disasters that they are not forgotten. one thing is certain, however: if he does go, trump will claim credit.",12.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.2678665771769981,0.28633770381566137,0.445795751720046,0.3712820101595569,0,0,0,0,4.455384121914683,2.0836401572525314,17.0,0.12256706807367831
House January 6 investigator says it's 'likely' 2020 election subversion probes will produce indictments,2023-02-23,80.0,"the top investigator on the house committee that probed the january 6, 2021, us capitol attack said wednesday it is ""likely"" that the georgia and federal investigations into efforts to subvert the 2020 presidential election will produce indictments. timothy heaphy told cnn's kate bolduan on ""erin burnett outfront"" that ""unless there is information inconsistent, which i don't expect, i think there will likely be indictments both in georgia and at the federal level."" in georgia, the foreperson of the atlanta-based grand jury that investigated former president donald trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 election told cnn on tuesday that the panel is recommending multiple indictments and suggested ""the big name"" may be on the list. the grand jury met for about seven months in atlanta and heard testimony from 75 witnesses, including some of trump's closest advisers from his final weeks in the white house. now that the grand jury is finished, it's up to fulton county district attorney fani willis to review the recommendations and make charging decisions. willis' decisions in this case will reverberate in the 2024 presidential campaign and beyond. trump, who has launched his 2024 campaign for the white house, denies any criminal wrongdoing. at the federal level, special counsel jack smith is overseeing parts of the criminal investigation into the capitol attack and has subpoenaed members of trump's inner circle. on wednesday, the new york times reported that smith had subpoenaed the former president's daughter ivanka trump and son-in-law jared kushner for testimony. ""i think it could be very important,"" heaphy said of the pair's potential testimony. ""they were present for really significant events. the special counsel will want to hear about the president's understanding of the election results and also what happened on january 6. and they both had direct communications with him about the events preceding the riot at the capitol,"" he said. the special counsel has a massive amount of evidence already in-hand that it now needs to comb through, including evidence recently turned over by the house january 6 committee, subpoena documents provided by local officials in key states and discovery collected from lawyers for trump allies late last year in a flurry of activity, at least some of which had not been reviewed as of early january, sources familiar with the investigation told cnn at the time. ""he will not stop because of a family relationship, because of purported executive privilege,"" heaphy said of smith. ""he believes that the law entitles him to all of that information, and he's determined to get it."" ivanka trump and kushner previously testified to the house select committee, which expired in january after republicans took control of the house. the panel had referred the former president to the justice department on four criminal charges in december, and while largely symbolic in nature, committee members stressed those referrals served as a way to document their views given that congress cannot bring charges. this story has been updated with additional information wednesday.",7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.42748673632740974,0.49457848857023884,0.07793476991355419,-0.39677749555323766,0,0,0,0,-2.7774424688726636,-0.416328074717804,23.0,-0.01810122063990452
Proud Boy testifies in sedition trial about far-right group being the 'tip of the spear' on January 6,2023-02-23,81.0,"the sole proud boy to plead guilty to seditious conspiracy in connection to the us capitol riot testified on wednesday that members of the far-right organization believed the country was barreling toward revolution and that they were the ""tip of the spear."" jeremy bertino, a top lieutenant to proud boys chairman enrique tarrio, testified as part of a cooperation deal that he struck with prosecutors against tarrio and four other members of the proud boys charged with conspiring to stop the certification of the 2020 presidential election. ""we had a big fight on our hands. it was going to be an uphill battle, and everyone had turned against us,"" bertino testified. ""my belief was that we had to take the reins and pretty much be the leaders that we had been building ourselves up to be."" his testimony allowed prosecutors to show jurors how the events of january 6, 2021, unfolded in the mind of a top member of the organization as he watched it online from his north carolina home, sending messages to his ""brothers"" about targeting then-house speaker nancy pelosi and assuring them that members of the far-left group antifa weren't there to stop them. some of the messages featured in court were from defendants in the case, whom bertino said he would ""take a bullet for."" but bertino and the five defendants -- tarrio, ethan nordean, zachary rehl, joseph biggs and dominic pezzola -- rarely made eye contact during the testimony. there was not a premeditated or specific plan to storm the capitol, bertino testified, adding that getting the proud boys to communicate and work together was like ""herding cats."" the proud boys had several group messages from the days before the riot where members mentioned descending on the capitol building, according to exhibits shown by prosecutors. 'foot soldiers of the right' as court challenges to the 2020 election failed, members of the proud boys -- who saw themselves as the ""foot soldiers of the right"" -- began to believe the country was headed toward an ""all-out revolution,"" bertino testified. ""i felt it coming,"" he said. the proud boys believed that the government was controlled by ""commies,"" he testified, and they began to turn against the police, whom the group increasingly saw as their enemy. everybody in the organization felt ""desperate,"" including tarrio, bertino told the jury. ""his tones were calculated,"" bertino said of tarrio. ""cold, but very determined. he felt the exact same way that i did."" members also were inspired by then-president donald trump's reference to their organization in a 2020 presidential debate, where he told the group to ""stand back and stand by."" bertino testified that there were ""nonstop requests for membership"" after the debate, specifically from people who wanted to attend rallies, and that the group did less vetting of new members to keep up with applications. during cross examination, bertino said that he thought the proud boys had a goal to stop the 2020 election but had no knowledge of how that goal would be achieved. ""i didn't have a direct idea of where they were going, how they were going to get there."" bertino was not in washington, dc, on the day of the riot because he was at home recovering from a stab wound he suffered during a previous pro-trump rally, but he testified that he watched on a livestream video. he saw the mob as starting the ""next american revolution,"" and told others proud boys he was brought to tears during the attack. ""i was happy, excited, in awe and disbelief that people were doing what they said they would do,"" bertino told the jury. when the crowd descended on the capitol building, ""it meant that we influenced people, the normies, enough to make them stand for themselves and take back their country and take back their freedom,"" he said. in chats to other proud boys, bertino encouraged members to move forward, telling them that he could see the capitol building on a livestream and that no members of antifa would be at the building to stop the pro-trump mob. bertino also messaged: ""they need to get peloton"" -- which he testified was a misspelled reference to pelosi. ""she was the talking head of the opposition and they needed to remove her from power,"" he said. by the evening of january 6, bertino grew angry at trump supporters for leaving the capitol building, he told the jury. ""the way i felt at the moment, if we give that building up, we were giving up our country,"" bertino testified. he sent encrypted messages to other proud boys members, saying that ""we failed,"" and ""half measures mean nothing,"" and, referring to lawmakers inside the capitol, ""fuck fear: they need to be hung."" ""once they took that step, there was no coming back from it,"" bertino testified wednesday. ""and they decided basically to balk and walk away after creating all that chaos down there."" ""the revolution had failed,"" he continued, ""because the house was still going to go on and certify the election."" bertino told the jury that after january 6, he tried to delete what he saw as incriminating messages on his phone and he wasn't fully truthful with fbi agents when they asked him about the capitol attack. ""i guess it's a natural instinct to protect yourself and protect those you love,"" bertino testified. ""i love them,"" he said of the five defendants.

Opinion: Trump's visit to Ohio derailment scene poses risk for Biden,2023-02-23,82.0,"on wednesday, former president donald trump headed to east palestine, ohio, in an apparent attempt to gain a political edge over president joe biden, whose administration he criticized for being more preoccupied with international affairs than with domestic issues like the toxic train derailment earlier this month. as biden concludes a successful trip to europe, where he paid a surprise visit to ukraine and reaffirmed america's commitment to stopping russian aggression, the residents of east palestine are still struggling with the fallout from the norfolk southern train derailment, which contaminated thousands of cubic yards of soil and more than 1.1 million gallons of water. the train, which was carrying hazardous chemicals including vinyl chloride and butyl acrylate, set off a massive fire that lasted for several days. residents in both ohio and pennsylvania were told to evacuate as authorities carried out a controlled release of toxic materials, which were diverted to a trench and burned off. many in east palestine are understandably concerned about the effects these chemicals might have on their health. even though federal air monitoring and water sample tests have indicated conditions are safe, residents have reported a number of ailments and thousands of fish have died in nearby creeks. trump, who donated water and cleaning supplies on wednesday, has been critical of the federal response, saying earlier this week, ""you have a president going to ukraine and you have people in ohio that are in desperate need of help."" on wednesday, he said he hoped biden has ""some money left over"" after he returns from ukraine. he isn't the only one -- florida gov. ron desantis also criticized biden for ""neglecting"" a ""lot of problems accumulating here in our own country,"" while republican presidential hopeful nikki haley made similar comments, asking, ""shouldn't he be with those people in ohio?"" transportation secretary pete buttigieg admitted on cbs news that he ""could have spoken sooner about how strongly i felt about this incident, and that's a lesson learned for me."" facing mounting criticism, buttigieg is now planning to visit east palestine on thursday. despite this criticism, democrats have been quick to point to the supposed hypocrisy of the republican attacks, criticizing trump for rolling back federal regulations on train safety, including one that would have imposed braking requirements for trains carrying certain hazardous material. (given the ongoing national transportation safety board investigation into the cause of the accident, it's unclear whether any of those regulations could have prevented the accident. the specific regulation regarding braking would not have applied to the train in ohio because it was not classified as a high-hazard flammable train.) but the biden administration needs to follow through and make sure that the government is providing the necessary support for people in east palestine. already, the environmental protection agency has stepped in, saying that it will force norfolk southern to clean up the contaminated soil and water, reimburse the epa for cleaning services, and more. it has also sent federal medical experts to the town to ""assess the public health needs"" at the site. but the president needs to reassure the residents of east palestine and make sure that the town has all the resources it needs for a comprehensive cleanup while calling for the establishment of safety regulations that can diminish the chances of this kind of accident from happening again. while the biden administration has tried more recently to emphasize the steps it has taken to address the accident, the president could pay a high political cost for appearing to ignore the domestic front in favor of the international realm. one can look back at president george h.w. bush, whose skyrocketing poll numbers after the us successfully forced iraqi troops out of kuwait without triggering a ground war was seen as a ticket to reelection. within months, those hopes evaporated as democrats criticized the administration for ignoring the economic recession gripping the nation. they pounced on the president, claiming he was out of touch with average americans and that his administration was slow to respond to the aftermath of hurricane andrew in florida. the famous mantra of the clinton team, ""it's the economy, stupid,"" was meant to be a constant reminder to everyone on the campaign to keep highlighting the difference between a democratic candidate whose focus was on the bread-and-butter concerns of americans and a president whose primary interest was foreign policy. the political finger pointing that has broken out after the train derailment comes at a time when people who live outside major cities harbor negative opinions about both parties, according to a report released by the nonprofit american families voices. according to a washington post-abc news poll, 6 out of 10 americans don't feel that biden has done much. the good news for democrats is that biden is not george h.w. bush. ""scranton joe"" is a politician who has always sought to connect with middle and working class voters. during the obama presidency, biden was tasked with making policy recommendations to tackle the challenges facing the middle class. and his administration has pushed a robust domestic agenda that has poured billions into local communities and bolstered family budgets. if republicans want to really take him on with this issue, the president will have plenty to point to — from the child tax credit to infrastructure projects. it is not just biden, either. from the new deal to the great society to president obama's domestic agenda, democrats have spent much of the 20th and 21st century championing federal programs to help achieve economic security. biden also recently pushed his vision of economic populism in his state of the union address. moreover, while inflation continues to be a serious problem for americans, job growth is booming and the economy has bounced back from the devastating effects of the pandemic, with the american rescue plan having played a big role in that effort. in other words, biden has plenty to work with to dispute the kind of claims being leveled by a republican party that has focused much more on supply side tax cuts, deregulation, and culture wars than on addressing the kind of crucial issues to emerge through the situation in east palestine. but former president bush, who lost in 1992 after serving just one term, still has a lesson to offer. biden can't take his or his party's record for granted, and if he runs for reelection, he must outline what more his party would be doing to address the kinds of structural challenges so many american communities face. if biden is indeed seeking reelection, he must make clear that he would be the candidate fighting hardest to make sure that america's working and middle class families will be better off than when his presidency started.

Trump visits Ohio train derailment site in effort to highlight Biden's absence,2023-02-22,83.0,"former president donald trump on wednesday visited the site of a train derailment, criticizing president joe biden's administration's handling of the railway disaster that spewed toxic chemicals in east palestine, ohio, 19 days earlier. his trip to one of the most conservative regions of the deep-red state came with many of the hallmarks of a presidential visit, as trump sought to contrast himself with biden -- who on monday made a historic war zone trip to ukraine's capital. as he visited little beaver creek, an ohio river tributary near the derailment site, trump said he thinks it is ""terrible"" that biden has not yet visited the site of the february 3 derailment. ""you are not forgotten,"" trump said as he stood alongside a small group of local officials, including republican sen. j.d. vance, and first responders after a briefing at a fire station. the former president's ohio trip came as the 2024 gop presidential race begins to take shape, with intra-party rivals lining up to take on trump. other republicans have also criticized biden's response to the derailment near the ohio-pennsylvania border. ""during any time of crisis, go to your people immediately,"" former united nations ambassador nikki haley said tuesday at a campaign stop in iowa. amid the increasingly pitched battle between democrats and republicans over whether the government has done enough to help the ohio town, trump sought to take credit for the escalating federal response, saying wednesday that the announcement of his visit ""opened up the dam."" he said the federal emergency management agency's announcement last week that it was deploying teams to the area should have come ""two weeks earlier, or at least a week earlier."" trump also said he had helped coordinate the delivery of thousands of water bottles to the area -- some with ""trump"" logos on them, coming from the former president's hotel properties. he said some of the water had come on the plane he had flown from florida on wednesday. ""if they don't come back and give you the treatment that you need, we will come back,"" trump said. the derailment of the norfolk southern train carrying toxic chemicals has become a political flashpoint -- and trump's decision to travel to east palestine has also focused new attention on his own administration's policies that encouraged the deregulation of the rail industry. trump ended a 2015 obama-era regulation mandating for trains carrying ""large volumes of flammable liquids"" like crude oil to have advanced brakes and speed restrictions -- put in place after a number of deadly derailments. ""a lot of the folks who seem to find political opportunity there are among those who have sided with the rail industry again and again and again, as they have fought safety regulations on railroads and hazmat, tooth and nail,"" said transportation secretary pete buttigieg, who announced wednesday he will visit the site of the derailment thursday. ""if people are going to find religion about rail regulation, sometimes for the first time, i welcome that."" experts told cnn that the regulations likely would not have impacted the derailment in east palestine because the train did not meet the criteria laid out by the obama administration-era regulation. republicans have largely ignored this argument, and instead bashed the slow response from the federal government, with some conservative commentators insinuating the pace was because residents in east palestine are gop voters. some have also contrasted biden's visit to ukraine, where he traveled to kyiv by train, with his absence in ohio. ""that was the biggest slap in the face that tells you right now he doesn't care about us,"" east palestine mayor trent conaway, a republican, said of biden's trip to ukraine earlier this week on fox news. ""i found that out this morning in one of the briefings that he was in the ukraine giving millions of dollars away to people over there and not to us and i'm furious."" trump's team coordinated the former president's trip with a number of officials on the ground, including conway. trump and his advisers have sought to take credit for the federal response seen in recent days. ""since trump announced the trip, the epa administrator changed his schedule and went [to east palestine], all the sudden fema changes course and provides federal help -- enough things have happened that we've already accomplished a lot of what we had hoped before even being on the ground,"" one trump adviser told cnn.

East Palestine derailment spurs rare signs of bipartisan agreement on rail safety. Will Washington act?,2023-02-22,84.0,"a fiery train wreck that released toxic materials in an ohio town is raising new questions in the halls of the nation's capital over the regulation of the rail industry and if stricter measures could have prevented the disaster. news of the east palestine, ohio, derailment -- and its potential harmful effects on the environment and health of local residents -- has propelled both democrats and republicans in congress to press the biden administration on whether there's enough oversight to keep rail workers and communities near railroads safe. and the supervising agency broadly responsible for regulating rail safety, the department of transportation, is calling on congress to make it easier to institute safety reforms. this rare, general bipartisan agreement about taking action in the wake of the derailment follows years of republicans generally supporting deregulation of the rail industry, including with the broad rollback of transportation rules during the trump administration. unions, current and former regulatory officials, and members of congress from both parties have signaled some optimism about the possibility that the ohio disaster may mark a rare opportunity for washington to get something done to enhance the rail industry's safety standards. but what's unclear is whether there's enough momentum for both parties in congress to propel the issue forward into tangible actions. nor is it clear whether the rail industry's strong lobbying efforts will pare down any proposed measures or play a hand in eliminating them altogether. transportation secretary pete buttigieg said in an interview with cnn on tuesday that that he's fed up with the rail industry's pressure campaigns to diminish regulatory reforms. ""i've had it,"" he said. ""we have had situation after situation where even modest, reasonable reform gets just a full court press."" ""i do think if the railroads, like norfolk southern, are in a mode right now where they're saying, 'we're going to do everything it takes and everything we can.' let's give them a chance to show it,"" buttigieg later added. ""but let's be very clear, i'm not waiting for them to do this work. i'm just saying they have a chance to put their money where their mouth is."" experts point out several areas of opportunity to enhance rail safety and hold rail companies further accountable: updating trains' braking system, shortening the lengths of freight trains, further separating cars with hazardous material, requiring more crew member be on board, and increasing penalties. many of these proposals, experts say, have been around for decades, and have oftentimes been diminished or entirely eliminated after rail lobbying efforts. data compiled by the nonprofit opensecrets show that norfolk southern spent $1.8 million on federal lobbying last year. norfolk southern posted record profits from railway operations of $4.8 billion in 2022, up from its previous record of $4.45 billion in 2021. the company did not respond to questions wednesday on whether it expects to change its share repurchase plans in the wake of the derailment. ""unfortunately, derailments like this are preventable and they become inevitable when there's more risk in the system,"" sarah feinberg, a former administrator of the federal railroad administration during the obama administration, told cnn. ""the industry has fought tooth and nail against safety regulations, but i also think that's typical of any industry."" rail industry's 'stranglehold on congress' lobbying influence from the rail industry is ""a big problem and they have a stranglehold on congress, especially in the senate,"" greg hynes, national legislative director for the smart transportation division union, told cnn. ""it's all about the bottom line and they adhere to the operating ratios that wall street is so hungry for, which includes lowering head counts -- which includes fewer safety inspections, fewer brake tests, fewer people doing the job that they need to do,"" he added. buttigieg recently sent a letter sunday to norfolk southern ceo alan shaw demanding accountability and calling for greater safety regulations. and dot subsequently announced on tuesday that it would take a three-pronged approach to enhance rail safety -- push companies to voluntarily adopt additional safety measures, call on congress to do more and bolster administration efforts to regulate the industry. among other plans to advance existing efforts or deploy existing funding, dot says it's initiating focused safety inspections as well as pursuing additional federal rulemaking on high-hazard flammable trains and electronically controlled pneumatic brakes. dot also says it's working to advance a proposed rule that would require a minimum of two crew members for most railroad operations. leadership for norfolk southern met with buttigieg and other dot officials and expressed concerns about the proposed rule. among other issues, norfolk southern argues it will lead to significant labor costs crucial to efforts to enhance rail safety, administration officials and rail experts say, is congress' ability to untie the executive branch's hands. dot is asking congress to increase the maximum fines that can be issued to rail companies for violating safety regulations. and similar to its regulatory efforts announced tuesday, dot is calling on congress to expand the rules ""governing high-hazardous shipments, including high-hazard flammable trains, pushing past industry opposition"" and follow through ""on new bipartisan support to modernize braking regulations and increase the use of electronically controlled pneumatic brakes."" ""the apparatus that exists was to allow safety regulators to write and finalize common sense safety regulations that will protect people -- protect their homes, protect their water, protect their children, protect their health -- it's totally broken,"" feinberg said. ""and the reason it's totally broken is because the congress and others -- other administrations -- will insert themselves into the process and take it over ... from safety regulators and say, 'i know better and i'm going to protect the industry from whatever you're trying to force its hand on.'"" the american association of railroads, an industry group, has said that ""until ntsb has completed their investigation, aar will not comment on potential policy changes in relation to this event as the cause and any underlying factors have not yet been fully determined."" the ntsb is set to release a preliminary report on the derailment investigation thursday morning. bipartisan congressional efforts congressional committees are set to review the environmental and safety impacts of the east palestine derailment. although efforts to enhance regulatory oversight of the rail industry have generally broken along party lines, some republicans and democrats appear to be moving in the same direction. senate commerce committee chair maria cantwell, a washington state democrat, sent a letter last week to seven of the largest railroad company ceos, inquiring about safety practices involved in rail transportation of hazardous materials. she's also requested a joint staff-level briefing with the environment and public works committee, asking federal transportation and environmental agencies to appear, according to politico. house transportation and infrastructure committee chair sam graves, a missouri republican, scheduled a bipartisan briefing for members of the committee last week, and there may be further briefings for committee and all house members to help keep them informed of the status and relevant issues, graves' office told cnn. republican sens. j.d. vance of ohio and marco rubio of florida sent a letter to dot requesting information about the administration's regulatory oversight, questioning whether the three crew members on board the norfolk southern train that derailed were enough to staff the 149-car locomotive. sen. ted cruz of texas, the leading republican on the senate commerce committee, last week tweeted that he fully agreed with minnesota democratic rep. ilhan omar, who wrote, in part, ""we need congressional inquiry and direct action from [buttigieg] to address this tragedy."" biden faces pressure to go to ohio republican candidates for president nikki haley and former president donald trump have criticized president joe biden for not visiting the site of the derailment, arguing that his trip to ukraine and poland this week shows he's more focused on a foreign crisis than what's happening at home -- an increasingly frequent critique of the president and his administration. trump -- whose administration sidelined the pending rule to require freight trains to have at least two crew members -- appeared in east palestine on wednesday alongside vance. rubio and buttigieg, meanwhile, are in a spat -- with the secretary suggesting the senator was previously parroting lines from the rail industry and rubio calling for buttigieg's resignation. ""anybody who has seen fit to get on television and talk about this incident, talk about this issue, can do right by the people of east palestine and everybody else who lives near a railroad,"" buttigieg told cnn. ""not just when it comes to this case, but when it comes to the future, by getting on the right side of this issue, and helping to raise -- not lower -- the bar of accountability for the railroad industry."" biden on wednesday posted on instagram about his phone call with his epa administrator michael regan and officials from ohio and pennsylvania to discuss the east palestine situation. he also accused the trump administration of limiting the ability to strengthen rail safety measures and said some of his current republican critics were trying to dismantle the epa. ""the department of transportation has made clear to rail companies that their pattern of resisting safety regulations has got to change,"" the caption stated. ""congress should join us in implementing rail safety measures. but the department of transportation is limited in the rail safety measures they can implement. why? for years, elected officials - including the last (administration) - have limited our ability to implement and strengthen rail safety measures."" following repeated calls for buttigieg to visit the ohio site, the secretary said earlier this week that he intended to visit east palestine when the time was right. and then on wednesday, dot announced that he would visit on thursday. a dot spokesperson said buttigieg had planned to go when it was ""appropriate and wouldn't detract from the emergency response efforts. the secretary is going now that the epa has said it is moving out of the emergency response phase and transitioning to the long-term remediation phase.""

One of the 'random people' chosen to investigate Trump goes public,2023-02-22,85.0,"it's a marvel of the american judicial system that emily kohrs, a 30-year-old woman who has described herself as between customer service jobs and who said she didn't vote in the 2020 presidential election, could play a pivotal role in the potential indictment of a former us president. but we're getting ahead of ourselves and so, too, may be kohrs, the foreperson of the special grand jury empaneled from may 2022 through january 2023 to help fulton county, georgia, prosecutors investigate donald trump. it's important to note that trump has not been indicted, and it's not clear he ever will be. he denies all wrongdoing. fani willis, the fulton county district attorney who conducted the sweeping investigation in which kohrs played a role, is still considering what, if any, charges should be brought against trump or anyone else for trying to overturn the election in 2020. prosecutors will make that decision -- not the special grand jury on which kohrs served and that heard from witnesses and prepared a report and recommendations. 'odd 15-minute pr tour' kohrs is cagily answering questions, teasing that the special grand jury may have recommended charges for trump and saying she hopes something comes of it all. her identity as the foreperson was first revealed by the associated press, and in addition to the ap, she has, in short order, done interviews with the new york times, nbc news, the atlanta journal-constitution and cnn. the former us attorney harry litman said on cnn on wednesday that prosecutors have got to be ""consternated"" that a potential jury pool could be contaminated by kohrs' ""odd 15-minute pr tour."" but he acknowledged that her teasing suggestion that trump could be indicted is nothing short of incredible. ""in terms of magnitude, i'm straining for the right adjectives, but it'd be the biggest thing that's happened in the criminal law perhaps in american history, right? this has never happened to a former president,"" litman said. while federal grand juries are notoriously secret affairs, grand juries empaneled in local courts have varying rules. there's nothing in the statute about special grand juries in georgia that says they must be secret. in fact, the statute says reports issued by special grand juries should be published if the grand jury recommends it. and kohrs says the judge gave her and the other jurors permission to speak to the press, albeit with limitations. 'an investigative tool' in an order rejecting the request of media organizations, including cnn, to release the full report, fulton county superior court judge robert mcburney noted the special grand jury is intended to aid the district attorney, not act on behalf of the court. the report, he noted, was issued to willis, not the court. and it is ultimately up to willis, an elected democrat, whether to bring charges against trump. mcburney also pointed out that what the special grand jury saw was not a trial where a defendant presents his or her side of a case, but was instead ""largely controlled by the district attorney."" the special grand jury had 24 jurors, including alternates, although all 24 were never present to hear witness testimony together. only kohrs has spoken publicly so far. willis' office caught off guard the special grand jury is essentially ""an investigative tool"" and a ""one-sided exploration,"" mcburney said, designed to enable willis to make her decision. mcburney released portions of the special grand jury report that said jurors wanted perjury charges brought against some witnesses. cnn's sara murray reported wednesday that willis' office was not responsible for authorizing whether or not members of the special grand jury could speak to the media and did not know ahead of time that kohrs was going to go public, according to a source familiar with the situation. not against any rules anthony michael kreis, an assistant professor of law at georgia state university, told murray that while kohrs' media tour was unusual -- particularly in a case where no one has yet faced charges -- kohrs was within her rights to discuss the case as long as she didn't delve into grand jury deliberations. ""she didn't do anything violative of her obligations,"" kreis said. ""i don't think she did anything that jeopardized fani willis' strategy or her ability to bring her case."" kohrs told reporters mcburney gave the jury instructions, and she seemed to consider exactly how far she could go before answering reporters' individual questions -- though she also seemed to enjoy the opportunity to dish about the grand jury proceedings. clearly excited to be part of this kohrs was clearly tickled to play a part in the special grand jury, laughing repeatedly during an interview with cnn's kate bolduan on ""erin burnett outfront"" tuesday night -- and seemingly starstruck at the appearance of former trump attorney rudy giuliani as a witness. on the other hand, kohrs' simple act of publicly embracing the role is a fascinating example of the us justice system, which ultimately relies on everyday people. trump dismissed kohrs and the willis investigation in a post on his social media network. ""now you have an extremely energetic young woman, the (get this!) 'foreperson' of the racist d.a.'s special grand jury, going around and doing a media tour revealing, incredibly, the grand jury's inner workings & thoughts,"" he wrote. here are some of the key portions of that fascinating interview with cnn. i've paraphrased bolduan's questions and have noted kohrs' responses in italics. how many people could be indicted? 12 people? 24 people? i think if you look at the page numbers of the report, there's about six pages in the middle that got cut out. allow for spacing, it's not a short list. will trump be indicted? i really don't want to share something that the judge made a conscious decision not to share. i will tell you that it was a process where we heard his name a lot. we definitely heard a lot about former president trump, and we definitely discussed him a lot in the room. and i will say that when this list comes out, you wouldn't -- there are no major plot twists waiting for you. people are now going to assume trump is on that list. can you speak to that? i can't. well, i might be able to, according to instructions. but i don't want to. i don't want to speak out on something that the judge, like i said, consciously chose not to release at this point. i don't know if i would interfere with the da's investigations. i don't know if i would interfere with procedures in some way. i very much do not want to cross that line. the released portion of the report focuses on a recommendation for charges of perjury. is perjury the main charge you recommended? i wouldn't say that. i would say that -- i would say that it ended up included there because it was less pointed of a suggestion than some of the other things we may have written in the parts of the report the judge chose to keep confidential. the perjury recommendations were less specifically related to a person? i will say that i thought it was important to keep it separate as well, at least in my opinion, not anybody else's but mine. there's a difference between the crimes we were called to investigate and crimes that were committed in the room. what's your lasting impression of being a part of the investigation for many months? i've loved being a part of this process. i think it's amazing to actually be able to be a part of this process for once. i think it's a privilege to be able to actually be a part of the system for once and making it work. this has been fascinating to get this peek into the world of politics and of all these different -- of government and of all these different things and have the curtain lifted just a little bit and let us peek in as regular people has been amazing. and i'm so glad that i did it. what do you say to people who question your findings? i think it's the opposite. i think that by choosing to have a grand jury, by choosing to impanel regular people, they very specifically chose to avoid politics, to take bias out of the question. because they chose to get, instead of anyone else, they chose to get 16 random people. are you worried about your safety given the current political environment? i'm not. i'm cautious about my safety. i'm aware of my safety, but i'm not worried. i don't think i should be -- i don't think i did or any of the jury members did anything that says we believe one way or the other about politics, about any of these issues. i think we were empaneled to find facts, and i think we did our best to find those facts and share those facts with the district attorney and her office.",11.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.6015825007449497,0.3306829705834389,0.06773452769795602,-0.5718698730411308,0,0,0,0,-6.290568603452439,-3.6600701739297357,35.0,-0.1045734335408496
"Steve Bannon's ex-lawyers sue him over nearly $500,000 in unpaid legal bills",2023-02-22,86.0,"a law firm that represented former donald trump strategist steve bannon during his fight against a subpoena from the house january 6 committee and other cases is suing bannon for nearly $500,000 in unpaid legal bills. the lawsuit states that davidoff hutcher & citron llp worked for bannon from november 2020 through november 2022 and represented him on several high-profile cases, including investigations into bannon's crowdfunding border-wall effort and the subpoena from the house select committee investigating the us capitol attack on january 6, 2021. ""this action simply seeks payment of an outstanding bill for legal services rendered in the amount of $480,487.87 in addition to scheduling a hearing on the reasonable attorneys' fees dhc is contractually entitled to as the prevailing party in this litigation,"" the law firm wrote. bannon's spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. while trump pardoned bannon in the federal border wall case, the manhattan da's office announced an indictment last year charging bannon with state charges of fraud, conspiracy and money laundering related to the effort. bannon has pleaded not guilty to the charges. the lawyers representing him in that case -- from a different firm -- have sought to withdraw from representing him and said there were ""irreconcilable differences."" bannon is due in court next week to update the judge on his efforts to find new lawyers. in his criminal case related to the house january 6 investigation, a jury convicted bannon of failing to turn over documents and appearing for testimony last summer. bannon has appealed his contempt of congress conviction for defying the committee's subpoena. robert costello, an attorney at davidoff hutcher & citron, had represented bannon opposite the house subpoena, but became a witness in the case so bannon had a different legal team at trial. the davidoff firm said in the lawsuit that its ""bills for fees and expenses totaled $855,487.87. defendant paid only $375,000.00 of the total bill leaving a total of $480,487.87 outstanding.""",2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.8366452157497406,0.15384116768836975,0.009513609576970339,-0.999999968943527,0,0,0,0,-1.999999937887054,-4.583053183049915,33.0,-0.13888039948636108
GOP 2024 hopefuls divided over US role in Ukraine war,2023-02-21,87.0,"the republican rift over the united states' support for ukraine was on vivid display this week, as 2024 presidential hopefuls staked out opposing positions on whether president joe biden's administration has done too much or too little to help the country a year into russia's invasion. the divide over the us role in ukraine is one of the opening fault lines of a gop race that is only beginning to take shape -- and one that could become a heated topic when republican primary debates begin in the coming months. what gop presidential candidates, and those taking steps toward entering the race, broadly agree on is that biden has mishandled the situation. but those hopefuls are split into two camps: isolationists, particularly former president donald trump and florida gov. ron desantis, who believe the united states is too involved in supporting ukraine's efforts to fend off the russian invasion; and hawks, including several former trump administration officials, who argue for an even more aggressive posture toward russia. both sides are warning that if their positions aren't heeded, a world war could follow. trump and desantis both accused biden of provoking unnecessary clashes with global powers by traveling to ukraine on monday. meanwhile, nikki haley, the former united nations ambassador who last week became the second major candidate to declare her candidacy, took the opposite position in stops in new hampshire and iowa, arguing for a more forceful us role. ""it's more than just about ukraine. this is a war about freedom. and it's a war we have to win,"" the former south carolina governor said monday night in urbandale, iowa. trump this week has repeatedly lambasted biden for his kyiv trip. ""world war iii has never been closer than it is right now,"" trump said tuesday in a video in which he pledged to ""clean house of all of the warmongers and america-last globalists in the deep state, the pentagon, the state department, and the national security industrial complex."" trump also sent supporters a fundraising email claiming biden is defending other countries' borders -- a clear reference to ukraine -- but putting americans ""dead last."" and on his social media network, truth social, trump said: ""if you watch and understand the moves being made by biden on ukraine, he is systematically, but perhaps unknowingly, pushing us into what could soon be world war iii."" but haley is among the latter group, telling voters in iowa that stopping russian president vladimir putin's ambitions in ukraine is necessary to prevent ""world war."" she, too, faulted biden -- but said the president has been too ""slow to the take"" and that he emboldened putin with the united states' withdrawal from afghanistan. she said the united states should continue supplying ukraine with military equipment and ammunition. ""if we win this fight for freedom it will send a signal to every enemy we have. if we lose this fight for freedom, russia has said poland and the baltics are next and then we've got a world war,"" she said. other prominent republicans have similarly argued for a forceful us role in ukraine. former vice president mike pence, who has said he is considering a 2024 run, said in an interview with fox news host sean hannity on tuesday that the us has ""got to stay in the fight"" in backing ukraine against russia's invasion. ""we are involved in a proxy war against the soviet union, the ukrainians are fighting it. and i really believe that it is essential that we see it through. we demand our european allies do more than their share because it is their front yard. but i think it is absolutely essential that after a slow start in providing support to the ukrainian military by the biden administration, we're now providing that support. but let's get them what they need, the tanks, let's get them the f-16s and support them as they finish this fight,"" pence said. former arkansas gov. asa hutchinson, who is also considering a 2024 presidential bid, said tuesday that biden's trip was ""a great moment for america."" ""we need to applaud this. this is a good moment for our country, and in those that respect, freedom and sovereignty, and those that are fighting against oppression,"" the former two-term republican governor said tuesday during an interview on fox news host brian kilmeade's radio show. desantis -- who this week made appearances on fox news and traveled to new york, philadelphia and chicago, delivering what could be a preview of his potential 2024 message -- appears to be attempting to out-flank trump in opposing biden's approach to the war. desantis on monday criticized american aid to ukraine as an ""open-ended blank check"" and questioned whether the united states should be engaged in the russian conflict at all. ""i don't think it's in our interest to be getting into a proxy war with china, getting involved over things like the borderlands or over crimea,"" desantis told ""fox & friends,"" referring to ukrainian territories that russia has seized through military force. asked on the program ""what a win looks like"" for the united states, desantis demurred and instead downplayed russia's military actions to date, saying the country was ""really wounded"" and suffered ""tremendous, tremendous loses"" without acknowledging the role that us weapons, military intelligence and aid have played in shaping the conflict. desantis insisted russia is not a threat ""on the same level as china"" -- a remark that is a stark departure from the years he spent in congress as a hawk on the issue as a member of the house freedom caucus, casting former president barack obama as weak in his approach to russia. ""the fear of russia going into nato countries and all that, and steamrolling, that has not even come close to happening,"" desantis said monday. ""i think they have shown themselves to be a third-rate military power."" gop rift over ukraine one of the earliest clashes of the 2024 race -- playing out with only two candidates officially having entered the republican primary -- is taking place against the backdrop of a broader debate within the gop over the united states' role in the war in ukraine and its broader foreign policy obligations. biden's trip to ukraine on monday, meeting with ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky to show support for kyiv nearly a year into russia's invasion and announce another $500 million in us assistance, was met with strident criticism from republicans who have aligned themselves with trump. rep. marjorie taylor greene of georgia said biden's visit demonstrated an ""america last"" policy. ""this is incredibly insulting. today on our president's day, joe biden, the president of the united states chose ukraine over america, while forcing the american people to pay for ukraine's government and war,"" greene said in a tweet. greene was one of 11 house republicans who co-sponsored a ""ukraine fatigue"" resolution earlier this month. the resolution called for suspending military and financial aid to ukraine. other house republicans have urged biden to increase support for ukraine. senate minority leader mitch mcconnell, at the munich security conference on friday, pledged gop support for ukraine and nato and argued for boosting military spending. he also insisted republicans are committed to global leadership. ""don't look at twitter. look at the people in power, like me and speaker kevin mccarthy,"" he said. south carolina sen. lindsey graham said in a statement he was ""very pleased"" biden visited ukraine. ""this was the right signal to send at the right time,"" graham said. the debate over republicans' approach to the war in ukraine is being shaped in part by polling that shows gop voters are less likely than democratic voters to support the united states playing a major role. about a year after the russian invasion of ukraine, recent polling suggests there's been a slight decline in support for us intervention in the war and a growing sense that the united states is doing too much, particularly among republicans. a quinnipiac university poll this month found that 40% of americans feel the united states is doing the right amount to help ukraine, with 30% saying the united states is doing too much and 22% too little. republicans are most likely to say that the us is doing too much (47%, compared with 35% among independents and 9% among democrats), while a majority of democrats say the effort is about right (56% among democrats compared with 39% among independents and 30% among republicans). an ap-norc survey conducted in late january found that most americans feel the united states should have a role in the russia-ukraine war at 75%, including 26% who say the united states should have a major role in the conflict. democrats, at 40%, were more apt than republicans, at 17%, to say the united states should be playing a major role. a fox news poll in late january found that about half of registered voters in the united states think that ukraine is winning the war against russia (51% said so, while 34% think russia is winning and 9% say neither are), and that most want to continue supplying weapons (64%) or money (63%) to ukraine. other republicans who are considering 2024 runs, including members of trump's former administration, have similarly argued that the united states should take a more active role in opposing russia's war in ukraine. former secretary of state mike pompeo said on fox news last month that the united states ""should be doing everything the ukrainians are asking us to do."" he noted that ukrainian leaders have not asked for direct us military support. ""they've simply said, provide us the stuff we need. and it is their lives that are at risk,"" pompeo said. ""helping america means a sovereign nation that is prepared to defend itself from an invasion and an attack where civilians are being killed by vladimir putin is in america's best interest for our economy, for our security,"" he said. pence has also sought to steer the republican party toward a more aggressive posture against russia, denouncing ""putin apologists."" he warned conservatives in a speech at the heritage foundation in october against being ""led astray by the siren song of unprincipled populism that's unmoored from our oldest traditions and most cherished values."" ""as russia continues its unconscionable war of aggression to ukraine, i believe that conservatives must make it clear that putin must stop and putin will pay,"" he added. ""there can be no room in the conservative movement for apologists to putin. there is only room in this movement for champions of freedom."" this story has been updated with additional reporting.",10.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.3075167268514633,0.5349075622856617,0.1575757132843137,-0.19773190419935943,0,0,0,0,-1.9773190419935944,-6.125807050206177,40.0,-0.15314517625515442
Ben Platt speaks out against antisemitic protests of 'Parade' on Broadway,2023-02-22,88.0,"audiences at the first preview of the broadway revival of ""parade,"" a musical about the dangers of hatred, were met by a group of antisemitic protesters, who gathered outside the theater before the show, said ben platt, a tony award winner who stars in the musical. ultimately, though, the group's presence only reinforced that ""now is really the moment' to perform this show, platt said in a video on instagram. platt, who plays leo frank, a jewish man who faced antisemitic hate in 1900s georgia, said the protesters harassed audience members on their way into the theater and said hateful things about frank, ""spreading antisemitic rhetoric that led to this whole story in the first place."" playbill reported that the protesters ""carried signs with hateful rhetoric,"" shouted at audience members waiting to enter the theater and attempted to hand out fliers. ""it was definitely very ugly and scary but a wonderful reminder of why we're telling this particular story and how special and powerful art and, particularly, theater can be,"" platt said in the video. ""and it just made me feel extra, extra grateful to be the one that gets to tell this particular story and to carry on this legacy of leo."" ""parade"" follows the true story of leo frank, a jewish factory superintendent in georgia who was accused and eventually convicted of murdering a young factory employee in 1913. though frank maintained his innocence throughout his trial, he was kidnapped from prison and lynched by a mob. per the new georgia encyclopedia, his trial was a ""miscarriage of justice"" fueled by antisemitism in the south, among other social issues. platt noted that security at the bernard b. jacobs theatre kept the cast and audience members safe during the protests. ""i just wanted the button on the evening, at least for me, personally to be to celebrate what a beautiful experience it is,"" he said. ""not the really ugly actions of a few people who are spreading evil."" ""parade"" producers shared a statement on instagram condemning the antisemitic protests. ""if there is any remaining doubt out there about the urgency of telling this story in this moment in history, the vileness on display in front of our theater last night should put it to rest,"" they wrote. ""we stand by the valiant broadway cast that brings this vital story to life each night."" antisemitic attacks have been on the rise in the last few years, hitting an all-time high in 2019, according to the anti-defamation league. the adl reported earlier this year that 85% of americans believe in at least one anti-jewish trope, which the organization said can lead to violence against jewish people. celebrities including kanye west and kyrie irving have shared antisemitic posts on social media, and former president donald trump dined with west and white nationalist and holocaust denier nick fuentes late last year. rabbi jeffrey myers, who leads the tree of life congregation in pittsburgh, where 11 people were killed by a white supremacist, told cnn last year that it's not on victims of antisemitic hate to battle it alone. ""it doesn't end with antisemitism,"" myers said. ""from antisemitism, it moves on to another minority group and another minority group until there's no one left to call out because all of the groups are no longer around.""",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.8908427953720093,0.09355680644512177,0.015600438229739666,-0.9999999999999999,0,0,0,0,-0.9999999999999999,-13.152530212748815,28.0,-0.4697332218838862
Lawyers for Proud Boys member take steps to subpoena former President Trump in seditious conspiracy trial,2023-02-22,89.0,"lawyers for a proud boys member on trial for seditious conspiracy related to his alleged role in the january 6, 2021, attack on the us capitol are taking steps to subpoena former president donald trump to testify as a witness for the defense. it's a longshot bid as judges have previously rejected subpoenas for trump and arguments that rioters were obeying his orders in other trials of january 6 defendants. trump's lawyers also wouldn't accept service of any subpoena for him unless they had extensive discussions about it first, according to a source familiar with the matter, and they have not decided on a proud boys trial subpoena. the justice department has not indicated in court, or in the email to defense attorneys, whether it plans to try to quash this subpoena. but doj has informed defense lawyers they can contact trump's attorney evan corcoran, according to an email reviewed by cnn. if he refuses to accept service, the justice department said they can reach out to the secret service's miami field office to facilitate the process, or ask the court to order the us marshals service to serve the subpoena. the subpoena asks for trump to come to the federal courthouse in washington, dc, on march 1, but bringing trump into court is likely an uphill battle. trump's attorneys also could move to quash the subpoena, and federal prosecutors still have the ability to argue that his testimony isn't relevant to the ongoing trial. a federal prosecutor on the case declined to comment. norman pattis, a lawyer who represents defendant joseph biggs, announced the subpoena in court last week and asked for the government's assistance in serving the subpoena. pattis told cnn on wednesday that he had reached out to corcoran about the subpoena and has not received a response. pattis added that he also has reached out to the secret service in miami. cnn has reached out to corcoran for comment. biggs and his four co-defendants are on trial for their alleged participation in the january 6 us capitol insurrection, and all five have pleaded not guilty. attorneys for the five defendants in this case, including biggs, previously asked a federal judge to allow them to argue to a jury that trump ordered their clients to storm the capitol on january 6. district judge timothy kelly rejected the argument, saying that trump did not have the authority to order a mob to storm the capitol. pattis told cnn that serving trump with the subpoena is ""the first of many steps"" in the process of getting the former president to testify in the high-profile sedition trial. pattis also said he anticipates lawyers for trump will move to stop the subpoena. ""i presented to the united states government a signed subpoena requiring the presence of donald j. trump at the proud boy trial sometime in march,"" pattis said on his podcast ""law and legitimacy"" last week. ""we're hoping that mr. trump -- ambitious as he is -- recognizes that this is an opportunity for him to begin to explain to the public his position on 'stopping the steal.'"" ""we have drawn the line,"" pattis continued. ""we have asked mr. trump to join us, and our position is, mr. president, you urged patriots to stop the steal in 2020 and early 2021. we have a simpler request: take the stand."" pattis added that they want to question trump on the period between november 3, 2020 and january 6, 2021. pattis has not said publicly what he would hope to elicit from trump's testimony, but several defense lawyers representing proud boys members have argued during this trial that their clients were called to action by the former president when he told the far-right group to ""stand back and stand by"" during a 2020 presidential debate, and that the proud boys believed they were acting at his behest on january 6. ""you see trump, president trump, told them the election was stolen. it was trump that told them to go [to the capitol]. and it was trump that unleashed them on january 6,"" sabino jauregui, the attorney for former proud boys chairman enrique tarrio, told jurors during his opening statement last month. ""it's too hard to blame trump,"" jauregui said. ""it's too hard to bring him in here with his army of lawyers. ... instead, they go for the easy target. they go for enrique tarrio.""

Foreperson on Georgia grand jury investigating Trump and 2020 election: 'I don't think you will be shocked' by indictments,2023-02-21,90.0,"the foreperson of the atlanta-based grand jury that investigated former president donald trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 election told cnn on tuesday that the panel is recommending multiple indictments and suggested ""the big name"" may be on the list. ""can you imagine doing this for eight months and not coming out with a whole list"" of recommended indictments, emily kohrs told cnn. ""it's not a short list. it's not."" she continued, ""there may be some names on that list that you wouldn't expect. but the big name that everyone keeps asking me about -- i don't think you will be shocked."" kohrs declined later tuesday to disclose exactly how many indictments the special grand jury recommended be brought as part of the investigation, saying only that she believes it is more than 12. asked by cnn's kate bolduan on ""erin burnett outfront"" whether the number of people was ""more than a dozen,"" kohrs replied: ""i believe so. that's probably a good assumption."" portions of the grand jury's final report, released last week, made it clear that the grand jury believed perjury charges were warranted for some witnesses. the foreperson's identity was first revealed by the associated press. and earlier on tuesday, kohrs told the new york times that the grand jury recommended multiple indictments, though she didn't provide names. the grand jury met for about seven months in atlanta and heard testimony from 75 witnesses, including some of trump's closest advisers from his final weeks in the white house. now that the grand jury is finished, it's up to fulton county district attorney fani willis to review the recommendations and make charging decisions. willis' decisions in this case will reverberate in the 2024 presidential campaign and beyond. trump, who has launched his 2024 campaign for the white house, denies any criminal wrongdoing. he has claimed that willis, a democrat, is politically biased, and still regularly promotes the false claim that he actually won the election in georgia. jurors, kohrs told bolduan, ""definitely heard a lot about former president trump and we definitely discussed him a lot in the room."" kohrs said that as part of the probe, she heard trump on calls separate from the infamous post-election one he made to georgia secretary of state brad raffensperger, a fellow republican, asking him to ""find"" the votes necessary to win georgia. ""yes, i am positive i have heard the president on the phone more than once,"" she said. cnn previously reported that at least one additional call by trump to a georgia state official was part of the investigation. willis' office was not responsible for authorizing whether or not members of the special grand jury could speak to the media and did not know ahead of time that kohrs was going to go public, according to a source familiar with the situation. 'i don't believe there was bias' despite trump's claims that the prosecutors are liberal zealots on a ""witch hunt,"" kohrs said she believed willis and her team acted in a non-partisan fashion and tried to keep the proceedings fair. ""i don't believe there was bias on the part of the da's team,"" she told cnn in the phone interview. ""i know for a fact that they were always very worried about accidentally coloring our opinions one way or the other ... they told us that they didn't want any of their opinions to affect any of our opinions, or any of their additional knowledge to affect our knowledge."" she said the prosecutors told her that they wanted the grand jury to ""make your opinions"" independently and to ""look straight at this by yourselves."" kohrs called on willis to take ""decisive action,"" now that the fate of the investigation is in her hands. ""personally, i hope to see her take almost any kind of decisive action, to actually do something,"" kohrs said. ""there are too many times in recent history that seem to me like someone has gotten called out for something that people had a problem with, and nothing ever happens."" kohrs said there are too many examples of ""famous people"" avoiding accountability after high-profile investigations. ""how often does something actually happen? i would love to see something actually happen. don't make me take back my faith in the system,"" kohrs said. ""the only thing i would be disappointed in, at this point, is if this whole thing just disappears. that's the only thing that would make me sad."" witnesses before her grand jury the foreperson also told cnn that she was ""pleasantly surprised"" by the friendliness of some witnesses, including key trump insiders like former white house national security adviser michael flynn, even though he invoked privilege and declined to answer some questions. ""some of those people fought not to be there, but once they were there, they were willing to have a conversation, and i respect the hell out of that,"" kohrs said. ""flynn was honestly very nice in person. he was a very nice man. he was definitely interesting. but i don't recall him saying anything earth-shattering."" using the fifth amendment or citing various legal privileges was a strategy that the grand jury saw from several of the most prominent witnesses, including trump white house chief of staff mark meadows, according to kohrs. ""mark meadows did not share very much,"" she said. ""i asked if he had twitter, and he pled the fifth."" cnn has reached out to meadows' attorney for comment about claims from kohrs that he repeatedly invoked the fifth and executive privilege. separately, a source familiar with the matter confirmed mike pence's former chief of staff marc short appeared before the special grand jury under subpoena. his appearance was previously reported by the associated press. the georgia investigation has long been seen as one of trump's biggest unsettled legal vulnerabilities, though any prosecution of him would be ripe for constitutional challenges and would face more scrutiny than perhaps any previous case initiated by a local prosecutor. in addition, justice department special counsel jack smith is investigating trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 election, his role in the january 6, 2021, insurrection, and his possible mishandling of classified material. in new york, a criminal probe led by the manhattan district attorney is still underway, and trump's namesake business is fighting a civil fraud lawsuit from the state attorney general. this story has been updated with additional details wednesday.

Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg to visit Ohio town affected by toxic train derailment on Thursday,2023-02-22,91.0,"transportation secretary pete buttigieg will visit the site of the train derailment in east palestine, ohio, on thursday. the secretary has come under intense pressure from east palestine residents and other critics to visit the town in the wake of the february 3 derailment of a norfolk southern train that released toxic chemicals. he told reporters earlier this week that he would visit ""when the time is right"" but was deferring to the national transportation safety board and its investigation first. an administration official told cnn that the time is now appropriate for buttigieg to go to east palestine. ""the secretary is going now that the epa has said it is moving out of the emergency response phase and transitioning to the long-term remediation phase. his visit also coincides with the ntsb issuing its factual findings of the investigation into the cause of the derailment and will allow the secretary to hear from usdot investigators who were on the ground within hours of the derailment to support the ntsb's investigation,"" the official said. ""the environmental protection agency is leading the federal response to hold norfolk southern accountable and make the company clean up its mess. that is how it works in response to a chemical spill. the department of transportation will continue to do its part by helping get to the bottom of what caused the derailment and implementing rail safety measures, and we hope this sudden bipartisan support for rail safety will result in meaningful changes in congress."" anger in the small town near the ohio-pennsylvania border has been rising, both at norfolk southern for the derailment itself and the government for its response. while epa administrator michael regan has been to the town multiple times since the derailment, demands for buttigieg to visit have been heard repeatedly in public forums. in response to the criticism, buttigieg said tuesday on cbs news he ""could have spoken out sooner."" ""i was focused on just making sure that our folks on the ground were all set but could have spoken sooner about how strongly i felt about this incident and that's a lesson learned for me,"" buttigieg said. the visit will come a day after former president donald trump visits east palestine. when asked about trump's visit on monday, buttigieg said he would ""stay on the right side of the hatch act,"", referencing a federal law that seeks to keep government functions nonpartisan. but he appeared to take issue with what he sees as political opportunists whose past policies may have encouraged the deregulation of the rail industry. ""whether we're talking about elected officials or anybody else showing up, there is a chance for everybody who has a public voice on this issue to demonstrate whether they are interested in helping the people of east palestine or using the people of east palestine,"" he said in response to the question about trump, who has launched a 2024 white house bid. buttigieg has previewed new rail safety efforts in a recent letter to norfolk southern ceo alan shaw earlier this week, demanding accountability and calling for greater safety regulations. and while much of the department of transportation's newly announced efforts in the wake of the derailment focus on calls to congress and the private sector to work to bolster rail safety, he said his agency will enhance its work as well. a dot news release states that the agency will continue to press to advance the ""train crew staffing rule,"" which would require a minimum of two crew members during most railroad operations. norfolk southern has opposed the proposed rule. this story has been updated with additional reporting.",3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.04594833481435975,0.6780857344468435,0.27596592406431836,0.4729864389180806,0,0,0,0,1.4189593167542418,-15.553086464710352,43.0,-0.36169968522582213
Biden's momentous 72 hours in Europe steels the West for the next stage of Russia's war in Ukraine,2023-02-22,92.0,"president joe biden barely slept as he rolled in the dark toward kyiv earlier this week, sitting awake as his curtained-off train car crossed into the warzone that has come to shape so much of his presidency. biden departed europe three days later having loudly recommitted to backing ukraine as it enters a second year of conflict, working to cast aside doubts about the durability of american support and directly blaming his counterpart in the kremlin for thrusting the continent into war. the 72 hours biden spent on the ground in ukraine and poland have been among the most momentous of his presidency, the culmination both of careful, highly secretive planning by white house aides and the president's singular, decades-held view of america's role in the world. in conversations with aides, foreign counterparts and even by phone with his wife over the course of his visit, biden has asserted his trip this week was essential in showing the world the us wouldn't waver in its support. as air force one returns to washington, however, it is difficult to ignore the looming questions biden's visit did little to answer: how and when the war will end. ""there will continue to be hard and very bitter days, victories and tragedies,"" biden said in remarks from the gardens of warsaw castle, lit dramatically and crowded with a flag-waving audience of thousands. ""but ukraine is steeled for the fight ahead. and the united states, together with our allies and partners, are going to continue to have ukraine's back as it defends itself."" biden did not necessarily set out on this week's trip to provide a better picture of the war's endgame, nor is he actively nudging the ukrainians toward the negotiating table with russia. indeed, biden and his aides do not view russian president vladimir putin as anywhere close to seeking a settlement in the war, an impression only reinforced by putin's belligerent and, in their view, delusional speech from moscow on tuesday. yet underneath biden's pledges of continued support for ukraine remains a lingering concern, shared with his european allies, that the war could descend into a stalemate as each side sees small gains and losses without a clear trajectory. what comes next the massive influx of weapons, ammunition and armor sent by the united states and other countries over the past few months was intended, in large part, to help ukraine secure battlefield gains that could strengthen its position at a to-be-determined negotiating table with russia. there have been persistent concerns at how ukraine is using those resources among some us and european officials, who have encouraged ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky to focus on planning and executing a spring counteroffensive rather than waging battle on multiple fronts, some with less strategic importance than others. in their closed-door conversation in kyiv on monday, biden and zelensky ""spent time talking about the coming months, in terms of the battlefield, and what ukraine will need in terms of capabilities to be able to succeed on the battlefield,"" according to us national security adviser jake sullivan, one of the tiny number of aides who accompanied the president on his covert visit to ukraine. tellingly, sullivan said much of biden's focus during the day-long journey into the warzone was spent plotting out how he would raise those issues with zelensky when they sat down to talk inside the gold-and-white mariinsky palace in kyiv. ""he was quite focused on how he was going to approach his conversation with president zelensky and, in part, how the two of them were really going to look out over the course of 2023 and try to come to a common understanding of what the objectives are, where ukraine is trying to get and how the united states can most effectively support them alongside our allies and partners in getting to where it wants to get,"" he said. afterward, biden's aides were tight-lipped about how exactly that discussion went, beyond saying there would be follow-up conversations among us and ukrainian officials in the coming days and weeks. almost certainly raised in the talks were zelensky's perpetual requests for more sophisticated weapons, including longer-range missiles and fighter jets. some of biden's other allies in the region have advocated for sending that kind of advanced weaponry as they look to provide ukraine any kind of advantage in the ongoing war. in earlier meetings, zelensky had also asked if the white house could devote some members of the us team to help further develop a 10-point peace proposal he first unveiled last year. yet that work remains ongoing, and there was little talk of peace talks during biden's trip this week. biden headed back to washington aboard air force one on wednesday evening local time. he tripped as he ascended the steps onto the plane, catching himself on a stair before recovering and going inside for the roughly nine-hour flight back to the nation's capital. biden and putin steel themselves for a long conflict instead, the president focused his remarks in warsaw -- a landmark address he's been developing for weeks -- on heralding the continued resistance of the ukrainians and accusing putin of a litany of atrocities. ""president putin chose this war,"" he declared. ""every day the war continues is his choice. he could end the war with a word."" a few hours earlier and several hundred miles away, putin was delivering his own important speech to political and military elite, offering a dramatically different narrative of the war as he accused the west of turning ukraine into a global confrontation. the differences between the two speeches were stark, both in content and character. biden was introduced in warsaw to a pulsing pop anthem; putin seemed to put some members of his audience to sleep with his hour-and-45-minute address. on wednesday, biden said it was a ""big mistake"" for putin to announce that he was suspending his country's participation in the new start nuclear arms reduction treaty. for as divergent as the two men's speeches were, however, they did seem to agree that the war in ukraine would not end in the near term. ""we have to be honest and clear-eyed as we look at the year ahead. the defense of freedom is not the work of a day or of a year. it's always difficult, it's always important,"" biden said. biden's aides said his remarks were intended for a multitude of audiences: the besieged ukrainian people, a polish population that has borne much of the outside burden, russians who may be disillusioned by their leaders' failings. but, at least in the view of some on his team, most important were listeners in the united states, thousands of miles from the frontlines, without a direct stake in the war and -- according to polls -- softening in their support for continued us assistance. commitment questions at home biden's critics used his trip this week to paint him as inattentive to his own country's needs, seizing upon a toxic chemical spill caused by a train derailment in east palestine, ohio, as an example of an american crisis deserving his attention. ""can we first acknowledge the fact that yes, biden is over in poland, but shouldn't he be with those people in ohio?"" asked nikki haley, the former south carolina governor and us ambassador to the united nations who is now seeking the republican presidential nomination, during a campaign stop in iowa. ""you always, you have to always during any time of crisis go to your people immediately."" following his speech tuesday in warsaw, biden did speak by telephone from his hotel with the governors of ohio and pennsylvania, along with the head of the environmental protection agency, to discuss the situation. ""i reaffirmed my commitment to making sure they have everything they need,"" he wrote in a caption accompanying a photo of the call that was posted on instagram. but he also used the opportunity to blast republicans -- including former president donald trump, who is set to visit east palestine on wednesday -- for loosing regulations and making it more difficult to strengthen rail safety. biden's aides ultimately believe republican members of congress will continue to provide support for ukraine, buoyed by the staunch backing of gop leaders mitch mcconnell and kevin mccarthy despite the protestations of some of their party's members. even so, the criticism this week that biden is overly focused abroad is telling, particularly from a republican like haley, who had assumed a more traditional view of america's role in the world. perhaps the most impassioned call this week for sustained american involvement in europe did not come from biden himself, for whom the concept is innate, but from polish president andrzej duda, once a top ally of trump who even proposed naming a military base ""fort trump"" in honor of his friend. initially viewed skeptically by the biden administration for his human rights record and reversal of certain democratic norms, duda has emerged as the united states' top partner in eastern europe amid the raging war in ukraine, overseeing a massive influx of refugees and turning poland into a logistics hub for the shipments of western military assistance over the border. speaking across the table from biden on tuesday, duda placed this week's events within a century-old context of robust american presence on the continent.

DeSantis gets 7-figure checks from top GOP donors as he soft launches presidential campaign,2023-02-22,93.0,"as florida gov. ron desantis intensifies his preparation for a white house bid, several of the wealthiest and most prolific republican donors are already giving him a major financial boost. trader and investor jeffrey yass donated $2.5 million to desantis' state political committee on february 7, according to online records maintained by the organization, friends of ron desantis. and jude and christopher reyes, the billionaire brothers behind one of the country's largest beer and food distributors, each gave desantis' committee $1 million last week as well. the seven-figure checks arrived ahead of what has amounted to a late-february soft launch of desantis' highly anticipated run for president. on monday, desantis held campaign-style rallies with police officers in new york, philadelphia and chicago, where he regaled the crowds with stories of the culture wars. ahead of a potential gop primary clash with donald trump, desantis will next host a three-day retreat for donors this weekend in trump's neighborhood. and his memoir, ""the courage to be free,"" drops next tuesday, with plans for a national book tour and events scheduled with gop activists in texas, california and alabama. this cascade of activity is the clearest sign yet that desantis intends to jump into the republican primary, though he's in no rush to do so. even as trump channels his energy at derailing desantis, the florida governor is sticking to plans to wait on a formal announcement until may or june, after state lawmakers hold their annual legislative session, according to sources close to the governor. desantis seemed to confirm the timeline during a monday appearance on fox & friends. ""we're going to sell some books. we're going to spread the message of florida. and then on march 8, i have our legislative session that's kicking off,"" desantis said. ""as we get beyond that, then we decide from there."" ""wouldn't you guys like to have that announcement on 'fox & friends'?"" he later teased. the continued financial support from wealthy donors -- achieved without actually declaring himself a candidate -- explains, in part, why desantis is content to remain on the sidelines. in addition to the $4.5 million from yass and the reyes brothers, desantis' political committee has more than $71 million left over from last year's reelection effort, when he shattered fundraising records en route to a lopsided 19-point victory in the sunshine state. cnn reached out to yass and the reyes brothers through their respective businesses to inquire about their donations to desantis' political committee, but they did not respond. desantis' cash on hand would put him on nearly equal footing with trump, who had more than $81 million stockpiled across five committees when campaign finance figures were last reported in january, and far ahead of any other competitor trying to usurp the former president for the party's 2024 gop nomination. it remains to be seen how desantis' political operation will move his reserve cash, which is parked in a state political committee, into a federal super pac that could support his presidential campaign without violating campaign finance laws, however; cnn previously reported that is ultimately the goal. a source close to desantis' political team confirmed a recent report from puck that phil cox, a veteran gop operative and a top adviser to desantis' 2020 campaign, is in the process of recruiting a team to helm that effort. cox previously ran the super pac tied to former new jersey gov. chris christie's 2016 presidential campaign. a spokesman for desantis' political operation declined to comment on plans for the money left over from the 2022 election. friends of ron desantis received about $670,000 in contributions in december and january, according to state records. the early support from the upper echelon of gop mega donors -- many of whom have been shopping for an alternative to trump -- could also make it difficult for other would-be contenders to launch a viable bid for the nomination. yass, the world's 42nd richest person with an estimated wealth of $30 billion according to forbes, made his presence felt during the midterms, donating more than $55 million to republican causes in federal campaigns. that doesn't include the millions yass spent in his home state of pennsylvania ahead of the primary for governor there last year, trying to boost bill mcswain over the far-right election denier doug mastriano. mastriano ultimately won the gop nomination with trump's support but lost the general election to democrat josh shapiro. the only donors to spend more money than yass during the last cycle -- billionaire hedge fund manager kenneth griffin and wisconsin shipping magnates elizabeth and richard uihlein -- have also supported desantis in the past. the uihleins donated just under $2 million to the republican's two gubernatorial campaigns. griffin, who has vocally called for the gop to move on from trump, has twice cut desantis' committee checks for $5 million and has already expressed interest in supporting him in the presidential primary. en route to raising $213 million for his reelection, the most ever by a non-self-funded gubernatorial candidate, desantis collected nearly 300 donations of six figures or higher. desantis-trump donor duel in palm beach many of his top donors will be in palm beach, florida, this weekend, where desantis has assembled about 150 donors for an exclusive retreat on the same barrier island that trump calls home. the summit will include policy and strategy sessions during the day and dinner, cocktails and cigars in the evening. it's an opportunity for the gop money class to see another side of desantis, who has earned a reputation for shunning donors at receptions and ducking out of events with guests still waiting for a photo. ""that's the undertone of the whole thing,"" said a republican consultant familiar with the retreat's planning. ""he's showing his people that he appreciates them and they're in the tent and their voices are meaningful and impactful. i think it's about strengthening those relationships and showing they care."" desantis' public maneuvering has increasingly drawn the ire of trump, whose super pac, maga, inc, is hosting its first major fundraiser at trump's mar-a-lago resort in palm beach on thursday. in his latest criticism of his one-time ally, trump said florida ""was doing great long before"" desantis became governor, while praising the leadership of former governors rick scott and charlie crist. beyond his public attacks, trump has privately expressed annoyance to allies about desantis' 2024 ambitions as recently as this weekend, a source told cnn. trump's remarks come on the heels of the warm reception desantis received from law enforcement during his three-stop tour through democratic turf on monday. desantis was ostensibly on the road to make a sales pitch for police to move to florida and tout his tough-on-crime policies, but it was clear that those in the crowds were already seizing up the florida governor as a possible alternative to trump. at desantis' stop in elmhurst, illinois, joe mcgraw, an illinois circuit court judge, said desantis was ""electric"" and that it was ""pretty much unanimous"" among attendees that desantis should seek the gop presidential nomination. bob kopp, a 71-year-old pastor and police chaplain, said he liked trump's record, voted for him twice and would vote for him again -- but also called the former president ""an insufferable narcissist."" ""it was so nice to hear someone reflect american values in a hopeful, positive -- it wasn't really demeaning of anybody,"" he said of desantis. ""he spoke of positive principles and values, and didn't get into personalities and demeaning."" desantis' arrival in new york city put the governor in the heart of trump's turf in his former home -- staten island, the only of the five new york boroughs that trump won in 2020. desantis spoke to police officers for 20 minutes and stopped for bagels, where he posed for photos and reportedly shrugged off questions about his political ambitions. ""people can see with their own eyes that things are going well in florida, so i'm not surprised that his message is resonating. if and when he decides to get in he'll have to convince people that his vision is best for america,"" said new york city councilman joe borelli, who met with desantis during the visit. ""i think it's going to be a tough choice for republicans. we're glad he came, and maybe dipped his foot in the water here, but we certainly welcome a visit from the former president and anyone else.""",14.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.39020745136908125,0.4283530999507223,0.18143943723823344,-0.2802590167058917,0,0,0,0,-3.9236262338824837,-16.50427696156403,48.0,-0.34383910336591733

countries on their way to the us-mexico border from applying for asylum in the us, marking a departure from decadeslong protocol. the proposed rule, which could affect tens of thousands of people, has garnered wide condemnation from democratic lawmakers and immigrant advocates alike. though it is reminiscent of a trump-era policy, white house officials on tuesday rejected the comparison to the trump administration, saying that it's not a categorical ban on asylum and emphasized efforts to expand access to legal pathways to the us. the rule will likely take effect in may when a pandemic-era border restriction known as title 42 is set to expire. 2. winter storm more than 65 million people in the us are under winter weather alerts today as a massive coast-to-coast storm hits the country with heavy snow and high winds. the alerts extend from as far west as california to minnesota through maine, but the upper midwest is expected to bear the brunt of the storm in terms of snowfall totals. minnesota's minneapolis area is at the highest risk to pick up at least 15 inches of snow, according to the latest forecasts. the expected conditions today have spurred states to take safety measures as travel conditions continue to deteriorate. more than 500 flights scheduled for today have also been canceled, with minneapolis and denver each accounting for more than 100 cancellations, according to flightaware. 3. presidential race a number of republicans have been making moves suggesting interest in a national presidential campaign and openly considering presidential bids. the primary field is early in its stages, but candidates are beginning to come forward -- and many more are expected in the coming months. the latest gop hopeful to announce a run for the republican presidential nomination is entrepreneur vivek ramaswamy. he follows nikki haley, whobecame the first major rival to challenge former president donald trump when she announced her bid last week. trump announced his third campaign for the white house last year. on the democratic side, president joe biden has yet to officially state his reelection plans, but analysts say an announcement is coming soon. 4. drug cartels genaro garcía luna, mexico's former security minister, was found guilty in federal court tuesday of taking bribes from the drug cartels he had sworn to combat, the us attorney's office said. the former secretary of public security in mexico served as his country's equivalent of the fbi director from 2006 to 2012. garcía luna, who is the highest-ranking current or former mexican official ever tried in the us, faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years in prison and a maximum of life behind bars. he will be sentenced in june. jesus ramirez cuevas, a spokesperson for mexican president andrés manuel lópez obrador, praised the verdict on twitter: ""the crimes against our people will never be forgotten."" 5. avalanche three climbers were killed in an avalanche while scaling an 8,000-foot peak in washington state over the weekend, officials announced. a six-person group was attempting to climb a steep gorge on colchuck peak in the cascade mountains on sunday when the avalanche happened, the chelan county sheriff's office said. the three victims ranged in age from 53 to 66 and died after being swept down about 500 feet, according to officials. their names have yet to be released. more than two dozen personnel have been involved in the rescue effort and local officials are urging people to be aware of the dangerous avalanche conditions before attempting

"Buttigieg says he'll visit East Palestine 'when the time is right,' lays out new rail safety efforts",2023-02-21,95.0,"transportation secretary pete buttigieg told reporters on monday that he plans to visit east palestine, ohio, ""when the time is right"" and announced new efforts by his agency to improve rail safety in the wake of a train derailment that has left local residents questioning the safety of their soil, air and water. ""i am very interested in getting to know the residents of east palestine, hearing from them about how they've been impacted and communicating with them about the steps that we're taking,"" buttigieg said on a monday call, adding that he had referred to past common practices of transportation secretaries by deferring first to the national safety transportation board after a major disaster like the derailment. ""but yes, when the time is right, i do plan to visit east palestine. i don't have a date for you right now."" buttigieg said he ""could have spoken out sooner"" and that it was a ""lesson learned,"" in an interview tuesday on cbs news' ""red and blue."" ""i was focused on just making sure that our folks on the ground were all set but could have spoken sooner about how strongly i felt about this incident and that's a lesson learned for me,"" buttigieg said. residents of the small community have criticized the response to the february 3 derailment of a norfolk southern train that released toxic chemicals. us environmental protection agency administrator michael regan returned to east palestine to meet with residents and local and state officials on tuesday. buttigieg previewed the new rail safety efforts in a recent letter to norfolk southern ceo alan shaw, demanding accountability and calling for greater safety regulations. and while much of the department of transportation's newly announced efforts focus on calls to congress and the private sector to work to bolster rail safety, he said his agency will enhance its work as well. ""we are accelerating and augmenting our ongoing lines of effort on rail regulation and inspection here at the us dot, including further regulation on high hazard flammable trains and electronically controlled pneumatic brakes -- rules that were clawed back under the previous administration -- to the full extent of that we are allowed to under current law, and we will continue using resources from the bipartisan infrastructure law to fund projects that improve rail safety,"" buttigieg said. a dot news release states that the agency will continue to press to advance the ""train crew staffing rule,"" which would require a minimum of two crew members during most railroad operations. norfolk southern has opposed the proposed rule. buttigieg also said that it's a good time to evaluate whether the federal government can ""expand the kinds of trains that count as high-hazard flammable train, so that there's a higher degree of safety."" ""let me also mention, though, one of the things you'll see in the plan that i'm urging the railroads to do is not to wait on us to mandate this,"" he added. dot is calling on norfolk southern and the rest of the freight rail and rail shipping industry to take a number of immediate actions, including committing to phasing in safer tank cars by 2025, the secretary said. the department is also calling on congress to take up legislation that would increase the maximum fines dot can issue to rail companies for violating safety regulations. on the call, the secretary repeatedly emphasized a new willingness from both sides of the aisle to address rail safety, saying, ""we're going to accelerate these actions and work, i hope, with the newfound bipartisan interest and support we've been seeing in congress to secure stronger legislation and overcome resistance by the (railroad) industry to water down this lifesaving work."" buttigieg said he would ""stay on the right side of the hatch act"" when he was asked about former president donald trump's upcoming visit to east palestine, referencing a federal law that seeks to keep government functions nonpartisan. but he appeared to take issue with what he sees as political opportunists whose past policies may have encouraged the deregulation of the rail industry. ""whether we're talking about elected officials or anybody else showing up, there is a chance for everybody who has a public voice on this issue to demonstrate whether they are interested in helping the people of east palestine or using the people of east palestine,"" he said in response to the question about trump, who has launched a 2024 white house bid. ""this is a community that, through no fault of its own, is going through enormous upheaval. and a lot of the folks who seem to find political opportunity there are among those who have sided with the rail industry again and again and again, as they have fought safety regulations on railroads and hazmat, tooth and nail. and so, if people are going to find religion about rail regulation, sometimes for the first time, i welcome that."" the secretary also discussed florida republican sen. marco rubio's recent statement questioning dot on freight train system safety. ""we heard from sen. rubio last week, who had some pretty strong words about this incident,"" buttigieg said. ""so, i guess what i would say is there is an opportunity right now, leaving aside the politics, for anyone on either side of the aisle to join us in raising the standard of accountability and safety. and if folks are serious about this -- republican, democrat or independent -- i will work with them to raise the bar. the rest is just politics.""",2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.08333372697234154,0.3934388756752014,0.5232273489236832,0.9510170803680182,0,0,0,0,1.9020341607360365,-2.63256945134091,25.0,-0.1053027780536364

"McCarthy gives Tucker Carlson access to January 6 Capitol security footage, sources say",2023-02-20,97.0,"house speaker kevin mccarthy has granted fox news host tucker carlson access to all of the us capitol security footage from january 6, multiple sources told cnn. the highly unusual move -- a house speaker handing over a massive trove of internal government materials to a friendly media outlet -- comes after the california republican faced significant pressure from his right flank to relitigate the work of the house select committee that investigated the january 6, 2021, insurrection. during his bid for the speakership, mccarthy vowed to hold hearings on the security failures that led to the capitol getting overrun, and he told the select committee to preserve all of its records for potential future review by the newly empowered gop majority. carlson has been one of the most prominent promoters of january 6 conspiracy theories. most notably, he has devoted significant airtime to the false claim that liberal ""deep state"" partisans within the fbi orchestrated the insurrection as a way to undermine former president donald trump. he has conducted sympathetic interviews with some of the rioters who were subsequently charged by the justice department. several gop lawmakers within mccarthy's ranks had hoped to review the material themselves, likely to hunt for footage that supports their controversial claims about the january 6 insurrection. by giving the videos to carlson, mccarthy is essentially outsourcing the task to right-wing media, at least for the moment. axios was first to report mccarthy's arrangement with carlson. us capitol police chief tom manger confirmed in a statement to cnn that capitol police gave mccarthy the security footage from the capitol attack to be released to carlson. ""when congressional leadership or congressional oversight committees ask for things like this, we must give it to them,"" manger said in a statement. capitol police cannot comment further ""because we have to stay out of politics,"" a department official told cnn. a fox news spokesperson told cnn that the axios report was accurate, but declined further comment. carlson told axios, ""there was never any legitimate reason for this footage to remain secret"" and that the videos will shed light on ""what actually happened on january 6."" house minority leader hakeem jeffries, the chamber's top democrat, was not consulted about the release of the security footage, a source familiar told cnn. another source told cnn that mccarthy didn't consult with his gop leadership team before making the decision. senate majority leader chuck schumer and senate sergeant at arms karen gibson only learned that mccarthy had granted carlson access when the news became public, a source familiar with the timeline told cnn. manger, the capitol police chief, did not know that mccarthy was giving carlson access to the footage until monday, which was after the arrangement had been made, the source said. the source explained that mccarthy, or any member of congress, could request access to the footage and that uscp would generally grant it. a separate source told cnn that if mccarthy asked the capitol police for the footage, he would not have to state why he wanted it in order to receive it. the now-defunct january 6 committee got access to all the security footage from us capitol police during its investigation, but did not release certain clips for security reasons. a source familiar with the panel's work told cnn that the unreleased footage was considered especially sensitive because it showed the movements of top officials while they evacuated to safety. separately, the house committee on administration made a request for the security footage, another source familiar told cnn. the panel, which was tasked with taking custody of all january 6 select committee documents, per house rules, requested the same access to the footage that the select committee had, the source said. pushback to the move house minority leader hakeem jeffries, a new york democrat, issued a letter to his colleagues tuesday vowing to get to the bottom of how mccarthy transferred footage of the attack to carlson's team. ""the apparent transfer of video footage represents an egregious security breach that endangers the hardworking women and men of the united states capitol police, who valiantly defended our democracy with their lives at risk on that fateful day,"" jeffries wrote in the letter. tim mulvey, a former january 6 committee spokesman, blasted mccarthy's move in a statement to cnn, saying, ""it's hard to overstate the potential security risks if this material were used irresponsibly"" by carlson or others. ""when the january 6th select committee obtained access to us capitol police video footage, it was treated with great sensitivity given concerns about the security of lawmakers, staff, and the capitol complex,"" mulvey said. ""access was limited to members and a small handful of investigators and senior staff, and the public use of any footage was coordinated in advance with capitol police."" democratic rep. bennie thompson of mississippi, the ranking member on the homeland security committee and former chair of the january 6 committee, later added in a statement that mccarthy, if he ""indeed granted"" carlson access, ""owes the american people an explanation of why he has done so and what steps he has taken to address the significant security concerns at stake."" when asked at a press conference last month about how some republicans previously urged former house speaker nancy pelosi to publicly release the full january 6 security footage, mccarthy signaled his support, saying, ""yeah, i think the public should see what happened."" in the courtroom, federal prosecutors have long tried to keep certain cctv clips from the capitol complex hidden from the public, saying in court that their release poses a national security risk and could give vital insight to bad actors who may be planning a future attack. us capitol police share the same concerns. january 6 defendants have access to thousands of hours of unreleased footage from the attack, as well from an online database, but the videos are tightly controlled by a protective order and defendants are not allowed to publicly release the clips. ""once the capabilities of a u.s. capitol interior surveillance camera, including its position and whether it pans, tilts or zooms, is disclosed to the public via the release of a single video from that camera, the cat is out of the bag,"" justice department prosecutors wrote in a july 2021 court filing. after more than a dozen news outlets, including cnn, sued for access to the videos in 2021, the chief judge of dc federal court ruled that the public has a strong interest in seeing some security footage from the attack. however, these video releases haven't been automatic or guaranteed. news outlets can request the public release of videos after they are played in open court, on a case-by-case basis. former dc metropolitan police officer michael fanone, who was attacked during the january 6 riot, called mccarthy's decision to give carlson access to security footage from that day a ""dangerous choice."" it ""guarantees that it will be selectively edited to fit an extreme maga narrative without care for the safety of capitol police, members of congress and congressional staff. airing footage of restricted areas of the capitol and sensitive evacuation protocols all while spreading misinformation about the nature of the attack on the capitol endangers everyone working in the building,"" fanone, who is now a cnn contributor, said in a statement to cnn. this story has been updated with additional information.

Trump leadership PAC spent more than $16 million on legal services in 2022,2023-02-22,98.0,"donald trump's leadership pac spent more than $16 million on legal services in 2022, according to a tally of the save america pac distributions through the end of december. the number represents a massive set of bills from lawyers at a time when the former president faces multiple criminal inquiries, lawsuits and other challenges. the money appears to be largely geared toward firms representing trump and his business and family interests. the disbursements show that save america pac paid more than $12.5 million to 16 law firms that have aided in his representation, either in the criminal matters or other legal disputes, according to cnn's review of the data and additional reporting. some of those law firms also represent others who've been sought out as subjects in the inquiries around trump. the firm of a trump defense attorney, alina habba, took in nearly $2 million from save america in 2022. habba madaio & associates has represented him opposite a new york state attorney general probe and in other lawsuits. another firm, van der veen, hartshorn and levin, which has lawyers who represented trump in his 2021 impeachment proceedings and also represented a trump organization entity in new york, was paid $1.4 million, according to federal election records. and the two law firms of trump's primary criminal defense attorneys, evan corcoran and james trusty, were each paid $1.2 million, save america pac reported. some law firms receiving save america's payments represent close contacts of trump's, such as mcguirewoods, which represents his former chief of staff mark meadows. the large law firms mcguirewoods and squire patton boggs, which represents former trump white house speechwriter staffers, received almost $900,000 and $250,000, respectively, while several smaller law firms that represent key witnesses in ongoing investigations received payments into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. in all, nearly 30 law firms received at least $100,000 from save america pac.",8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.2514675222337246,0.5808181930333376,0.16771427338244393,-0.017236304367470145,0,0,0,0,-0.13789043493976116,-1.8887845190561716,17.0,-0.11110497170918657
Opinion: What it means to stand behind Vladimir Putin,2023-02-21,99.0,"one year into russia's invasion of ukraine, vladimir putin is more dangerous than ever. the russian dictator marked the anniversary of his unprovoked aggression -- which has killed or wounded close to 200,000 of russia's own soldiers and turned some 16 million ukrainians into refugees -- by suspending russia's participation in a key nuclear arms deal that kept the threat of nuclear war at bay and giving a 100-minute speech to the country on tuesday blaming ukraine and its supporters for the war putin started. in emphasizing his vision of a conservative, traditional and patriarchal russia at war with a more libertine west, putin's speech drew directly from the strongman's playbook: deflect blame, lie to suit your own interests, lean into a reactionary and hateful form of masculinity to get the crowds cheering. it would be something of a pathetic showing if this particular strongman didn't happen to have control of the largest nuclear arsenal in the world. the nuclear agreement that putin suspended, called new start, limited the number of nuclear missiles that both the us and russia could have deployed and gave both nations the right to inspect each other's nuclear sites. with putin's move to suspend his nation's participation in the program, the last remaining nuclear deal between the two nations is effectively dead and we have returned to a dangerous era of nuclear dysregulation. putin's decision is indeed ""deeply unfortunate and irresponsible,"" as us secretary of state antony blinken put it. other experts were starker in their assessments. ""this is more about nuclear blackmail, but it is extremely dangerous,"" andrei kolesnikov of the carnegie endowment for international peace told the bbc, ""because we cannot predict how putin will behave in the future and what is in his mind."" for americans who came of age after the end of the cold war, this renewed threat of nuclear annihilation is both new and terrifying; for those who lived through the original cold war, this is no doubt a hair-raising reboot. but it's not just about a renewed nuclear threat. in poland after an historic wartime visit to kyiv, us president joe biden gave a speech of his own, also highlighting a fundamental divide -- not between conservative religiosity and liberal tolerance, as putin put it, but between autocracy and democracy. ""the democracies of the world have grown stronger, not weaker,"" biden said. ""but the autocrats of the world have grown weaker, not stronger."" he continued: ""that's what's at stake here: freedom."" biden is correct that this is indeed a battle between freedom and oppression. it's worth nothing, though, that putin's emphasis on cultural and gender warfare is also correct, in its own way. he is of course lying and fear-mongering when he fulminates about same-sex marriage or the prospect of a gender-neutral god and when he says that the west seeks ""the destruction of the family, cultural and national identity, perversion and the abuse of children are declared the norm."" it is true, though, that there is a clear historical and contemporary relationship between conservative religiosity and autocracy on the one hand, and liberal tolerance and democracy on the other. conservative religiosity is of course not a requirement for autocracy -- just look at the previous era of russian autocracy, which was decidedly irreligious. and the autocrats in beijing, who are expanding their own nuclear arsenals and toying with lending material support to russia, are not exactly bringing conservative christian principles to china. but they are embracing traditionalism, hypermasculinity and a backward-looking national identity. among analysists of global authoritarians, a familiar refrain has emerged: make [x country] great again. xi jinping is trying to make china great again, writes the new yorker's evan osnos. ""putin set out to 'make russia great again,'"" gen. david petraeus told cnn earlier this month. and, of course, we all know the american version. in his speech, biden took great pains to emphasize that the villain here is putin, not russians writ large; while biden did frame the battle as one between freedom and totalitarianism, he did not feed into putin's claims that this is a war between western liberalism and russian traditionalism. it's informative, though (and scary) to realize the extent to which a number of right-wing americans believe putin has a point about the west being degenerate, and seem comfortable bringing a strongman in to restore the traditional order. the most salient divide is not between east and west; it's between those who want pluralistic liberal democracies that allow people to live freely no matter what their religious beliefs, sexual orientations and aspirations -- and those who prefer autocratic strongmen who use the law to impose conservative, traditional values whether people like it or not. former us president donald trump notoriously praised putin and trashed nato, elevating the dictator's status among pro-trump conservatives. as of a year ago, republicans in the us had a more favorable view of putin than of biden, vice president kamala harris, former house speaker nancy pelosi and the democratic party. tucker carlson has used his influential spot on fox news to spout pro-putin propaganda. newly-elected sen. jd vance of ohio has said, ""i don't really care what happens to ukraine one way or another,"" while former trump economic advisor peter navarro has declared ukraine ""not really a country,"" and former trump secretary of state mike pompeo has praised putin by saying, ""i have enormous respect for him."" meanwhile, georgia rep. marjorie taylor greene claimed that ""nato has been supplying the neo-nazis in ukraine with powerful weapons and extensive training on how to use them."" on the campaign trail in november she pledged that ""under republicans, not another penny will go to ukraine."" nick fuentes, the white nationalist who recently dined with trump and rapper kanye west at mar-a-lago, told his followers, ""i wish putin was president of america."" andrew torba, the ceo of the right-wing platform gab, put the issue in even starker terms last year: ""what (putin) really means is ukraine needs to be liberated and cleansed from the degeneracy of the secular western globalist empire."" putin has positioned his russia as the leading light for christian nationalists worldwide, standing against western secularism and decadence. and many christian nationalists, including in the united states, have gotten in line. this is not just a divide between russia and the us. it's a divide within russia itself, as the nation's feminists, lgbtq rights advocates, and democracy activists continue to push (often at great personal risk) for a freer and fairer country. and it's a divide within the us, too, between the americans who want liberal democracy to thrive, and those who want their ideology to rule us all. a year into putin's war, it's clear that he is willing to sacrifice untold lives to cement his power and russia's imperial interests. americans have a choice, both at home and abroad: do we stand with autocrats and their small, hateful view of the world? or do we stand for freedom and democracy -- including the obligation to live among those whose views you don't agree with and whose choices you wouldn't make yourself? the decision, and the stakes, couldn't be clearer.",3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.15032392740249634,0.5774490336577097,0.27222701410452527,0.3929657711833692,0,0,0,0,1.1788973135501075,1.3151661844778488,16.0,0.08219788652986555
