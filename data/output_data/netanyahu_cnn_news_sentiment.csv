"About 160,000 people protest against Netanyahu's judicial overhaul in Tel Aviv",2023-02-26,0.0,"about 160,000 people demonstrated in tel aviv saturday night against the israeli government's plans to weaken the country's judicial system, crowd expert ofer grinboim liron told cnn. that would make it one of the biggest single demonstrations yet against the legislation. grinboim liron, the ceo of crowd solutions, which specializes in crowd dynamics at events and venues, based his estimate on drone photos at 8 p.m. local time (1 p.m. et). organizers of the protests said an additional 130,000 people protested in other demonstrations across the country saturday night. numbers from organizers have been higher than estimates from independent experts such as grinboim liron. tel aviv and other cities around israel have been seeing regular saturday night demonstrations against the judicial overhaul plans for eight weeks. the package of legislation would give israel's parliament, the knesset, the power to overrule supreme court decisions with a simple majority. it would also give the government the power to nominate judges, which currently rests with a committee composed of judges, legal experts and politicians. it would remove power and independence from government ministries' legal advisers, and take away the power of the courts to invalidate ""unreasonable"" government appointments, as the high court did in january, forcing prime minister benjamin netanyahu to fire interior and health minister aryeh deri. four legislative clauses that are part of the overhaul took steps forward this week. the bills allowing knesset override of supreme court decisions and removing the court's power to rule government appointments unreasonable both passed early stages of the process on wednesday and now go to the committee stage. two other clauses passed first readings on monday and require two more readings to become law. critics accuse netanyahu of pushing the legislation in order to get out of corruption trials he is currently facing. netanyahu denies that, saying the trials are collapsing on their own, and that the changes are necessary after judicial overreach by unelected judges. about two out of three (66%) israelis believe the supreme court should have the power to strike down laws incompatible with israel's basic laws, and about the same proportion (63%) say they support the current system of nominating judges, a poll for the israel democracy institute found last week. people who say they voted for opposition parties were far more likely than voters for the parties in the coalition to oppose the changes. nearly nine out of 10 (87%) people who voted for the opposition said the supreme court should have the power to strike down laws incompatible with basic laws, while only 44% of coalition voters said it should. the percentage was slightly higher among people who voted for netanyahu's likud party, with nearly half (47%) saying the supreme court should have that power. israel does not have a written constitution, but a set of what are called basic laws. the survey, which was released february 21, found that about half (53%) of israelis believed that removing the political independence of the judiciary would harm israel's economy -- as israeli economists and businesspeople have been warning. about a third (35%) do not believe the changes would harm the economy. the online and telephone survey of 756 adults in israel was carried out between february 9 to 13, 2023, and has a margin of error of 3.56 points.",4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.7336227940395474,0.1752898278646171,0.09108740312512964,-0.563375059742856,0,0,0,0,-2.253500238971424,,,
11 Palestinians killed during Israeli raid targeting militants in West Bank,2023-02-22,1.0,"at least 11 palestinians were killed wednesday during a rare daytime raid by israeli military forces in the occupied west bank that also left more than 100 injured, palestinian officials said in the aftermath of an operation described by the local director of red crescent as a ""massacre."" israeli authorities said wednesday's operation in nablus targeted three suspects ""planning attacks in the immediate future."" the three were ""neutralized,"" the israel defense forces (idf) and israel security agency said in a joint statement. all three of the suspected palestinian militants targeted by the idf were killed, a list of the dead released by the palestinian ministry of health shows. the idf said one was shot while fleeing and the other two were killed in an exchange of fire with the military. israeli authorities said that suspects threw rocks, molotov cocktails and ""explosive devices"" at israeli forces. at least 102 people are injured, according to the official palestinian news & information agency (wafa) citing the palestinian health ministry. seven of the injured are in critical condition, wafa reported. the israeli military's daytime raid began at around 10:15 a.m. (3:15 a.m. et), ahmad jibril, the local director of red crescent, told cnn. it is ""a time when everyone is out shopping in the open market of the old city. no one expects an invasion at this time of the day,"" he said. there were israeli snipers on the rooftops shooting live ammunition, he said. ""that's why many people were shot in the head, shoulders and backs,"" he said. most of the dead were shot in the head, he added. ""people who were unarmed and even away from the old city were also shot. bullets were everywhere!"" he said. jibril said there was a drone dropping tear gas ""randomly."" he also said drones were firing live ammunition, which the idf denied. maj. nir dinar, an idf spokesman, told cnn that israel did not operate drones that fired live ammunition in the west bank. ""i think what they saw was small drones that drop tear gas grenades as a riot dispersal means, and these were used,"" he said. red crescent's jibril said some israeli special forces were disguised as locals, and while dinar refused to comment on whether there were undercover israeli operatives, he said: ""the idf has such capabilities."" jibril said their ""teams were prevented from reaching the injured,"" including a four-year-old child with a heart condition who was rendered unconscious by tear gas. the idf's dinar said that he hoped it was not true that israeli troops had prevented medics from reaching the wounded: ""i am not familiar with such behavior and i hope it did not happen. if they have evidence, let us know and we will take it to the commanders."" briefing journalists about the raid, the main idf international spokesman, lt. col. richard hecht painted a picture of a large, chaotic event, which he said got ""very messy."" israeli security agency and border police special forces had approached the house where they believed the suspects were located and told them to surrender, he said. ""they didn't surrender, they confined themselves into the house and opened extensive fire on our forces,"" he said. one of the suspects tried to leave the house and was shot, he said, while the other two continued exchanging fire with the israelis. ""and at some point, we upgraded our efforts. and there were also rockets that were fired on the house. and the two guys were neutralized,"" he said, later confirming that meant killed. pressed for details about the rockets, he said: ""when you come into a situation when people are not surrendering, you intensify the fire."" but the battle continued on other fronts, he said, with israeli reconnaissance units coming under fire. ""it was cars, it was firing from the roofs and it was motorbikes -- a very, very aggressive exchange of fire,"" he said. ""a lot of violence."" he said the importance of the targets explained the idf decision to go into the militant hotspot in broad daylight. while they prefer ""night time activity,"" he said the daylight raid ""was based on a specific intelligence indication we got from the shin bet,"" as the israeli security agency is generally known. ""that's why we went in there. these are guys that killed one of our soldiers."" 'patience is running out' the islamic jihad militant group said two of its commanders were killed in the clashes with israeli troops. the lion's den militant group also confirmed its members were involved in the fighting, but did not say if any of their members were killed. one of the dead targeted in the nablus raid was a hamas member, the palestinian militant group said. hamas claimed hussam salim as a member and a martyr, releasing a photograph of him holding an assault rifle with a telescopic sight. the idf named him as one of their targets, accusing him of carrying out ""shooting and explosive device attacks"" and dispatching the killers of idf soldier ido baruch last year. the idf identified salim as a senior operative of lion's den, which claimed responsibility for the killing of baruch in october of last year. there is overlap between the membership of palestinian militant groups. six of the dead were men in their 20s, the palestinian health ministry said. one was 16, one was 33, one was 61 and was was 72. all were men, the ministry list of dead shows. the raid brings the number of palestinians killed by israeli forces to 61 this year, the palestinian health ministry said. that number includes people shot as they attacked israelis, militants being targeted in raids, people clashing with israeli forces during raids, and bystanders, cnn records show eleven israelis have been killed in palestinian attacks this year: seven in a shooting near a synagogue, three in a car ramming attack, and a border police officer who was stabbed by a teenager and then shot by friendly fire from a civilian security guard. idf raids into the west bank usually occur overnight; the last time the military conducted a daylight operation, they said it was because of an immediate threat. islamic jihad's armed faction in gaza, the al qassam brigade, warned they are ""watching the enemy's escalating crimes against our people in the occupied west bank, and its patience is running out."" 'violent and deadly' the occupied west bank has been rocked by a series of lethal israeli military raids in the past year, as tensions in israel and the palestinian territories remain sky-high in a region riven by bloodshed. an israeli raid in the city of jenin in january caused the deadliest day for palestinians in the west bank in over a year, according to cnn records, with at least 10 palestinians killed on the day and one dying later of his wounds. one day later, at least seven civilians died in a shooting near a synagogue in jerusalem -- which israel deemed one of its worst terror attacks in recent years. this comes as netanyahu leads a cabinet that has been described as the most far right and religious in the country's history. netanyahu previously told cnn's jake tapper that people can get ""hung up"" on peace negotiations with the palestinians, saying he has opted for a different approach. as relations between israeli forces and palestinian militants boil over, cnn's hadas gold said the scenes on wednesday reflected those ""not seen since the second intifada,"" or uprising.",2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.035661443689111935,0.17777089952980563,0.557754113259962,0.7663919044213289,0,0,0,0,1.5327838088426577,,,
Your flight from Israel might be about to get quicker. Here's why,2023-02-23,2.0,"for years, journey times flying east from israel depended on who you were flying with. if you were boarding a flight operated by israeli airlines, including national carrier el al, your flight would take around two hours more than if you were flying with another airline. the reason? israeli airlines were banned from the airspace of both oman and saudi arabia. that meant flights to india and southeast asia, which would naturally head east from israel, had to dip south, crossing over jordan and following the red sea down to the bottom of the arabian peninsula, before hooking northeast. now, all that is set to change. following the saudi government's announcement in july 2022 that the country's airspace would open up to all carriers, oman has followed suit. on february 23, the civil aviation authority of oman announced that it will open its airspace to ""all carriers that meet the requirements of the authority for overflying"" -- effectively ending the ban on el al, israir and arkia, israel's three airlines. in a tweet, it said the move was ""part of the sultanate of oman's continuous efforts to fulfil its obligations under the chicago convention of 1944, which stipulates non-discrimination between civil aircrafts used in international air navigation."" the move could cut israeli carriers' flight times to asia by up to three hours, jonathan sivarajah, an el al frequent flier and israeli aviation commentator, told cnn. he added that it ""opens up further opportunities [for the airlines], not only to asia but potentially to australia, too."" el al's nonstop flight from tel aviv to bangkok is currently listed as taking 10 hours 45 minutes. but a nonstop flight on royal jordanian from amman -- 100 miles east of tel aviv -- takes eight hours 10 minutes. in fact, flying tel aviv to amman, and then on to bangkok can be quicker, even including transfer time at the airport -- a connecting flight can take as little as nine hours 55 minutes on royal jordanian. when the airline was banned from saudi airspace, el al flights from tel aviv to mumbai took seven hours 45 minutes. that flight time was then slashed to five hours 15 minutes, before the route was put on hold. as the announcement was made, el al swiftly posted a map of their old and new routes to southeast asia on instagram. sivarajah said that until now, competing international carriers have ""flooded"" israel with quicker flights than what the country's own airlines were able to provide. ""tel aviv-bound foreign carriers such as air india could operate over territory which el al couldn't. there was a significant fare difference because of the routing in favor of the likes of air india,"" he said. ""it wasn't until the abraham accords [of 2020] and the saudi approval that it became partly possible for israeli carriers to compete. the last stumbling block was oman."" he expects the new routings to start ""within the next few days."" in a statement, israel's prime minister benjamin netanyahu called it ""a day of great news for israeli aviation."" he added: ""the far east is not so far away and the skies are no longer the limit. ""we have worked to open the airspace, first over saudi arabia, and from 2018 when i visited oman, to add oman as well, so that we can fly directly to india and on to australia. this was achieved today, after considerable effort, including in recent months. here is good news -- israel is opening up to the east on an unprecedented scale."" israel's foreign minister eli cohen also released a statement, calling the news ""a historic decision that will shorten the road to asia, lower costs for israeli citizens and help israeli airlines to be more competitive."" he personally thanked the sultan of oman, haitham bin tariq al-said, for his ""substantial help"" in the process. the announcement came after months of talks between the two countries. it also follows an announcement earlier this month that el al would start a frequent flier partnership with uae carrier etihad airways. frequent fliers can now collect and spend air miles across both airlines. the two had started codesharing on flights in 2021. last year, el al said that a route from tel aviv to melbourne, australia, was in the works.",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0065166058073587284,0.43868198990821844,0.2900955212466857,0.6322616018553262,0,0,0,0,0.6322616018553262,,,
Israel launches airstrikes on Gaza after rocket attacks as violence escalates,2023-02-23,3.0,"israel launched airstrikes targeting alleged weapons manufacturing and storage sites in gaza on thursday, following a rocket attack from the coastal enclave, the israel defense forces (idf) said. in a statement, the idf said ""fighter jets struck a weapons manufacturing site"" in central gaza owned by hamas, the palestinian militant group that runs gaza. ""in parallel, a military compound belonging to the hamas terrorist organization in the northern gaza strip which also was used as a naval weapons storage warehouse was struck,"" the statement said. earlier thursday, the idf said five rockets fired from gaza toward israeli territory, including the cities of ashkelon and sderot, were intercepted and another rocket fell in an open area. the airstrikes come after the deaths of at least 11 palestinians in nablus in the occupied west bank on wednesday, which occurred during a raid by the israeli military that also left at least 500 injured, palestinian officials said thursday. one of the dead targeted in the nablus raid was a hamas member, and two were islamic jihad commanders, the two militant groups said earlier. ""our teams dealt with 488 injuries during the occupation forces' invasion into nablus, including 103 injuries of live bullets taken to hospitals in nablus,"" the palestinian red crescent said. the other injuries included tear gas inhalation and shrapnel wounds, they said. the palestinian ministry of health confirmed the numbers. the raid in nablus lasted about four hours and, unusually, took place in broad daylight because the idf said it had intelligence on where the suspects were. the idf accused them of being responsible for the death of an israeli soldier and of posing an imminent threat. prime minister benjamin netanyahu vowed thursday that israel would ""settle accounts with those who attack israeli civilians and idf soldiers,"" praising the previous day's israeli military raid into nablus. netanyahu said that raid targeted ""three terrorists"" who ""shot and murdered staff sergeant ido baruch last october and they were about to carry out additional attacks against us."" ""i would like to commend the isa and idf intelligence for the precise intelligence,"" that led to the raid, the israeli prime minister said, referring to the israeli security agency, the shin bet, and the israel defense forces. he also thanked ""the soldiers who acted with heroism and confidence under fire."" the united nations special coordinator for the middle east peace process said late wednesday he was ""appalled by the loss of civilian lives"" in the raid.

Opinion: Netanyahu's 'reforms' are threatening the very foundations of Israel's democracy,2023-02-21,4.0,"so bewildering is the rush of news around the world today, and so radical is the discourse, that sober-minded observers are often inclined to take a step back and assume all angers will subside. but it would be a mistake to be sanguine about what's happening in israel. those who care about the country, a technological and military power far beyond what its close to 10 million population suggests, should understand how dire this moment is. israel's existence is in peril — certainly as a democracy and, in the longer term, as a viable economy and jewish state. the context: the new far-right government of third-time israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu, which came to power after elections in november, is attempting to overhaul the system of checks and balances that has maintained political stability in the country. the knesset, israel's parliament, began debating the legislation monday amid protests both in the chamber from opposition lawmakers and from tens of thousands outside. the self-inflicted damage would be breathtaking. the proposed reforms would subordinate the judicial system to the executive and to the leader of the executive branch, netanyahu, who has a conflict of interest due to his ongoing corruption trial. (netanyahu has repeatedly proclaimed his innocence and labeled the court proceedings against him a ""witch hunt."" notably, he insisted throughout the 2022 campaign that no hasty and extreme assault on the judicial system, nor any machinations to end his trial, would take place.) the main issue is a proposed ""override clause"" enabling the knesset, which because of israel's electoral system is an extension of the executive, to veto court decisions. also planned is legislation enabling the government to appoint the judiciary directly and politicize the civil service. in a country without a real constitution (instead, a series of ""basic laws"" that are easy to enact and alter) and with a unicameral parliament, this could easily mean the end of civil rights and minority guarantees. in other words, if a future government is not implementing dangerous abuses of power without judicial review — say, banning palestinian or arab citizens of israel from voting — it would only be because it chooses not to do so. netanyahu and his allies argue the israeli people have spoken. but the ruling coalition won just a thin majority (64 seats out of 120) in the knesset, resting largely on the fact that two opposition parties — which unwisely splintered — barely missed the 3.25% threshold for getting into parliament. polls show only about a quarter of people want the reforms implemented. hundreds of thousands have joined demonstrations opposing them. opponents include not only top judicial figures but also almost all the ex-heads of the security establishment — the military, the mossad intelligence agency, the shin bet domestic security service and the police. a public letter signed by 400 of these officials warned of ""damage for generations."" the plans, as revealed, could go as far as to turn israel into a jewish version of turkey or hungary, authoritarian regimes led by fervent populists. after cowed courts, one could expect a muzzled media, attacks on liberal nongovernmental organizations and efforts to disenfranchise the 20% of israeli citizens who identify as palestinians or arabs. moreover, the court system has also been the main protector from total subjugation of some 3 million west bank and east jerusalem palestinians — who have been in effect ruled by israel for 55 years and lack the right to vote. given this, plus separate but related plans to increase jewish settlement activity and hand most dealings with the palestinians to the country's top nationalists, the military warns a third palestinian uprising is imminent. prominent doomsayers include leading figures of the stunning technology sector, which accounts for a sixth of israel's economy, a quarter of income tax revenue and half of exports. hundreds of major multinationals have research centers in israel, many of which are fortune 500 companies. these companies — from meta and google to intel and apple — are a top driver of the economy. s&p says the legislative reforms will negatively affect israel's credit rating, while the former head of the bank of israel, a top jpmorgan chase official, warns the country is in ""danger of losing everything."" money has already begun flowing out of the country amid fears a collapse of rule of law would undermine contractual law and property rights. netanyahu's propaganda claims the courts have over the years overstepped their authority by preventing governability — a supposed plot by elites to impose leftism. the truth is that over 75 years of israeli statehood, the supreme court has intervened with laws just 22 times, mostly involving uncontroversial civil rights. only three cases involved security issues. netanyahu's propaganda also claims supreme court judges currently ""self-select themselves."" but judges are appointed by israel's president, from shortlists drawn up by three members of the nine-member judicial selection committee, which includes three of the court's justices alongside four politicians and two members of the bar association. under the proposed system, however, the government would appoint them all, likely yielding toadies. opponents of the plan speak of fleeing the country en masse should it succeed. considering west bank palestinians' outrage over their disenfranchisement, some of israel's remaining arab enemies ready to pounce and the security establishment in uproar, the collective threat is clear. across social media and on the streets, other frenzied opponents of the plan are speaking seriously of civil war. benny gantz, the ex-military chief and former defense minister, has warned of such a devastating possibility; former prime minister naftali bennett cautioned in a recent radio interview that a constitutional crisis looms. should the government pass its reforms and then ignore a supreme court decision striking them down, key institutions like the israeli military would not know where legitimacy lies, bennett hypothesized. ""i am afraid we will reach bloodshed,"" he added, ""an internal rift that cannot be repaired."" bennett — a nationalist, but a responsible one — is right. israel's friends worldwide, and anyone interested in the stability of a nuclear power, would be wise to take note and speak up. this is a rare moment in history — fascinating and horrifying in equal measure — when an important country in an unstable region is on the cusp of undoing itself.",6.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.5921836257912219,0.2100783884525299,0.19773801683913916,-0.43169723050528175,0,0,0,0,-2.5901833830316905,0.19586258828236192,17.0,0.011521328722491878
Space pods and flying dragons: How Saudi Arabia wants to transform its capital,2023-02-20,5.0,"it looks like a city out of a science fiction movie: space pods, flying dragons and floating rocks. but this is the birthplace of islam, saudi arabia, which wants to transform its capital into one of ""the most livable cities on earth."" the kingdom is building a new downtown in the capital riyadh, its sovereign wealth fund announced on friday. spearheaded by crown prince mohammed bin salman (mbs), the ""new murabba"" (new square) project is meant to expand the capital by some 19 square kilometers (4,695 acres) to accommodate hundreds of thousands of residents. at the heart of the project is the ""mukaab,"" a 400-meter (1,312-foot) high, 400-meter wide and 400-meter-long cube that is big enough to fit 20 empire state buildings. it offers ""an immersive experience"" with landscapes changing from outer space to green vistas, according to public investment fund (pif), the mbs-led $620-billion sovereign wealth fund. the project is due to be completed in 2030. holographic technology is meant to offer ""a new reality"" to consumers as they shop and dine. the building also includes recreational facilities as well as hotels and residential units. saudi arabia, which has been the subject of bad press for decades due to human rights violations, has embarked on an ambitious project to diversify the economy away from oil and shed its image as a conservative, closed-off state. ""back in the day, you would have negative discussions about saudi arabia affiliated to human rights abuses,"" said andreas krieg, research fellow at the king's college london institute of middle eastern studies. ""but now they're trying to push new narratives of being a country of development and one that can build futuristic cities."" but some analysts say saudi arabia has serious regional competition from neighboring dubai and the qatari capital doha, both of which have for decades tried to position themselves as regional tourism and investment hubs. ""being second in the race is always a tough place to start when you want to become the leader,"" said simon henderson, director of the gulf and energy policy program at the washington institute. he added that it is particularly difficult for saudi arabia because ""they've spent decades not attracting foreign, non-muslim visitors."" but some have questioned whether the project will even come to fruition. saudi arabia has announced similar mega projects in the past, work on which has been slow. in 2021, mbs announced his $500 billion futuristic neom city in the northwest of the country, with promises of robot maids, flying taxis, and a giant artificial moon. and last year, he unveiled a giant linear city, the line, which aimed to stretch over 106 miles and house 9 million people. the kingdom already has an $800 billion plan to double the size of the capital in the next decade, as well as transform it into a cultural and economic hub for the region, according to saudi media. ""the more absurd and futuristic these projects get, the more i can't help but imagine how much more dystopian everything surrounding them will be,"" wrote dana ahmed, a gulf researcher at amnesty international, on twitter. saudi officials have insisted that work on the projects is going ahead as planned. it's unclear how much new murabba will cost, or how pif plans to finance it. asked about the cost and financing plans, pif told cnn that details have not yet been disclosed and that it will announce further information in due course. some analysts are skeptical, saying that the kingdom may not be able to gather enough funding to fulfill its ambitions. ""the finances of all of this are not entirely secured. they have tried to get a lot of foreign direct investments (fdi) to realize this project,"" said krieg, adding that investment hasn't come in the way riyadh may have hoped. saudi arabia is hoping to raise its fdi to 388 billion riyals ($103 billion) annually by the year 2030. the kingdom's current fdi stands at $19 billion as of 2021, according to the united nations conference on trade and development's (unctad) 2022 world investment report. whether the kingdom will be able finance the project also depends on the price of oil, said henderson. the price per barrel is currently in the low $80s, he said, noting that the kingdom may need oil prices to pass the $100-mark in order to finance national megaprojects. while some mocked the new city and cast doubts about its viability, others pointed to the uncanny resemblance its cubic skyscraper has with islam's holiest site in mecca. the kaaba, the name of which comes from the same root as the name of the new mukaab building, is the structure that billions of muslims turn to for prayer five times a day, and to which millions make pilgrimage every year. ""building a new kaaba exclusively devoted to capitalism is a little too on the nose,"" tweeted murtaza hussain, a journalist. turkey-syria earthquake the death toll from the turkey-syria earthquake continued to rise two weeks after it struck as turkey ended its search and rescue operations in all but two affected provinces. the number of those killed in turkey rose to 41,156 by monday, the country's disaster and emergency management authority (afad) said. turkey ended search operations in all but the provinces of kahramanmaraş and hatay, it announced on sunday. the combined death toll in turkey and syria is now 47,088. here's the latest: the body of ghana soccer star christian atsu arrived in accra, ghana, on sunday evening after it was flown from turkey, ghana's ministry of foreign affairs and regional integration (mfa) said. ghana's vice president mahamudu bawumia and a large military procession met the coffin on arrival in accra. at least 80% of the buildings in turkey's hatay province have to be rebuilt, the province's mayor said on sunday. more than 105,000 buildings have been identified as collapsed or heavily damaged or about to collapse, according to turkey's vice president fuat oktay. the united states will bring in another $100 million to assist victims of the quake, secretary of state antony blinken said. the digest israel's netanyahu accuses iran of attacking tanker in persian gulf region israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu accused iran on sunday of attacking a tanker ship in the persian gulf region, apparently referring to the israeli-affiliated campo square, which was lightly damaged on february 10, its management company said. background: the campo square ""was hit by an airborne object while in the arabian sea approximately 300 nautical miles off the coasts of india and oman"" on the night of february 10, ship management company eletson said in a statement, adding that there was minor damage to the vessel. the ship ""is owned by a liberian company which is linked to the british company zodiac maritime ltd.,"" zodiac maritime told cnn sunday. the company's chairman, eyal ofer, is israeli. why it matters: it's the second time in less than three months that a tanker linked to israel has been attacked off the coast of oman. on november 15, the pacific zircon was struck by what the united states said was an iranian-made drone. iran international tv moves studio out of uk after alleged threats from tehran government an independent iranian tv station, iran international, has moved its broadcasting studio from london to washington dc at the advice of the london police after ""a significant escalation in state-backed threats from iran,"" the station announced on saturday. the uk's head of counter terrorism policing said on saturday that police continue to respond to threats from iran against uk-based individuals and a persian-language media company it didn't name. background: iran international tv gained significance since anti-government protests broke out across iran in september, which was followed by tehran restricting the internet and strictly controlling information in the country. iran has accused saudi arabia of funding the channel, which its owners have denied. why it matters: iran has sanctioned iran international's parent company volant media for ""supporting terrorism."" the channel was previously warned by uk authorities in november that their reporters were under increasing threats. a man was arrested near the station's london location on february 11 and charged with a terrorism offense, according to the statement. saudi arabia says arab states need new approach toward syria saudi foreign minister prince faisal bin farhan said at a munich security forum on saturday that consensus was building in the arab world that isolating syria was not working and that dialogue with damascus was needed ""at some point"" to at least address humanitarian issues, including a return of refugees, reuters reported. background: riyadh, which had cut off ties with the syrian regime due to its brutal suppression of protests there, has sent aid planes to government-held territory in syria as part of earthquake relief efforts. it was the first saudi flight to a regime airport in more than a decade. why it matters: the minister's remarks mark a shift from the early years of syria's 12-year civil war when several arab states, including saudi arabia, backed rebels that fought syrian president bashar al-assad. shunned by the west, assad has been basking in an outpouring of support from arab states that normalized ties with him in recent years. around the region a popular tunisian actor has invited controversy after declaring on television that he hates the hijab, the head covering worn by many muslim women. mohamed kouka made a hand gesture showing himself ripping off an imaginary hijab on attessia tv, saying it denies women their humanity. ""it takes the value of women to the lowest, and i therefore have a hatred for the hijab,"" he said. other guests on the television show countered that the head covering is a personal choice. many more took to social media to condemn the actor, accusing him of inciting against hijab-wearing women. a clip of his comments posted on facebook by the channel garnered more than 13,000 comments, many of which opposed his position. former tunisian health minister abdellatif el mekki wrote on his facebook page, addressing the actor: ""you have a right not to be convinced by the hijab or anything else, but you don't have the right to say what you said, because at the least it is a lack of acceptance of differences, and it can be construed as incitement."" kouka later went on mosaique fm to say he respects a woman's right to choose and that he doesn't hate women who wear the hijab. asked why he said he would rip the hijab off, kouka said it was ""a joke."" he refused to apologize. the hijab is a sensitive topic in tunisia. the wearing of the covering was severely restricted by the regime in the muslim-majority country prior to the 2011 revolution that sparked the arab spring. the new governm",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.13704874209115203,0.4659434724861467,0.009683804101192614,-0.3051375222361446,0,0,0,0,-0.3051375222361446,2.144225305017641,14.0,0.15315895035840293
Protests across Israel as Netanyahu's government introduces bill to weaken courts,2023-02-20,6.0,"a controversial set of bills that would weaken the independence of israel's judicial system passed its first reading in the knesset, israel's parliament, in the early hours of tuesday morning local time. both bills passed 63 to 47. prime minister benjamin netanyahu's coalition government has 64 seats in the 120-member chamber. a bill must pass three readings in the knesset to become law. netanyahu's allies pressed forward with the legislation despite tens of thousands of israelis demonstrating against the changes over the past seven weeks. on monday, protesters blocked roads in cities across israel during demonstrations against netanyahu's planned judicial reforms. demonstrators in jerusalem turned the streets around the supreme court and knesset into a sea of israeli flags, which organizers were handing out before the event began. among the protesters were a few dozen women dressed in long red dresses and white head coverings, like handmaids in the margaret atwood novel ""the handmaid's tale,"" along with drummers, horn-blowers and at least one juggler balancing an israeli flagpole on his nose. the jerusalem demonstration was visibly smaller than one in the same location a week earlier, but still appeared to number about 75,000 people an hour and a quarter after it was scheduled to begin, crowd control expert ofer grinboim liron told cnn. liron is the ceo of crowd solutions, a company that specializes in crowd dynamics at events and venues. protesters had begun to disperse by 4:30pm local time (9:30am et), a cnn team there observed. the demonstration had largely finished early evening local time in jerusalem. but soon after, chaotic scenes emerged inside the knesset as the session to officially debate the bill for its first reading in parliament began. many opposition lawmakers from former prime minister yair lapid's yesh atid party raised israeli flags in the chamber, some draping them over their shoulders, and shouted over government lawmaker simcha rothman as debate began. knesset security took flags away from lawmakers and escorted some out of the chamber. the bills have so far sparked weeks of public protests, a plea from president isaac herzog to delay for negotiations, and a rare intervention into israeli domestic politics by us president joe biden. netanyahu's coalition is seeking the most sweeping overhaul of the israeli legal system since the country's founding. the most significant changes would allow a simple majority in the knesset to overturn supreme court rulings. the reforms also seek to change the way judges are selected, and remove government ministries' independent legal advisers, whose opinions are binding. us president joe biden has expressed concerns over the reforms, saying: ""the genius of american democracy and israeli democracy is that they are both built on strong institutions, on checks and balances, on an independent judiciary. building consensus for fundamental changes is really important to ensure that the people buy into them so they can be sustained."" on sunday, netanyahu defended the judicial reform. ""israel is a democracy and will remain a democracy, with majority rule and proper safeguards of civil liberties,"" he said during an address to the conference of presidents of major american jewish organizations. ""all democracies should respect the will of other free peoples, just as we respect their democratic decisions. ""there's been a lot of rhetoric that is frankly reckless and dangerous, including calls for bloodshed in the streets and calls for a civil war. it isn't going to happen. there's not going to be a civil war,"" the prime minister added.

Thousands protest Netanyahu's plan to weaken Israel's judiciary as president warns of 'social collapse',2023-02-13,7.0,"tens of thousands of flag-waving israelis converged on the nation's parliament monday, amid warnings that prime minister benjamin netanyahu's plan to weaken the judiciary risks plunging the country into a ""social collapse."" protesters held signs with messages including ""there is no democracy without equality"" and ""destroying the country to avoid trial"" -- a reference to the perception that netanyahu's desire to halt his corruption trials is behind his government's planned judicial reforms. lgbtq rainbow flags and a few palestinian flags were sprinkled among many israeli flags in the crowd. television pictures showed some demonstrators dressed as handmaids from the dystopian book ""the handmaid's tale,"" in long red dresses with white head coverings. despite the protest -- and an impassioned plea from president isaac herzog on sunday night not to start the legislative process -- the government began introducing the reform bill in parliament, the knesset, on monday as planned. herzog warned that israel is ""on the brink of constitutional and social collapse,"" and possibly faces ""a violent collision."" chaotic scenes unfolded within the knesset's constitution, law and justice committee meeting on the bill before the protest even got underway, as opposition members of parliament chanted ""shame."" at one point some of them jumped over tables to yell at coalition members, before being removed by security. the bill passed the committee vote and will face a first reading in the full knesset, likely on wednesday. netanyahu's coalition is seeking the most sweeping overhaul of the israeli legal system since its founding. the most significant of the changes would allow a simple majority in the knesset to overturn supreme court rulings. the reforms also seek to change the way judges are selected, and remove government ministries' independent legal advisors, whose opinions are binding. us president joe biden, who rarely expresses an opinion on internal israeli politics, called for consensus in a statement to the new york times on sunday: ""the genius of american democracy and israeli democracy is that they are both built on strong institutions, on checks and balances, on an independent judiciary. building consensus for fundamental changes is really important to ensure that the people buy into them so they can be sustained."" meanwhile in an unusual primetime address on sunday evening, israeli president herzog called for a halt to the legislative process so that both sides could come together and work on reforms based on consensus. recognizing that both sides should have their voices heard, herzog presented a five-point plan for reform which included changing the way judges are selected and strengthening elements of the country's basic law. israel has no written constitution. although the us praised herzog's speech, israeli minister of justice yariv levin said while there were ""positive elements in his proposal,"" there were ""also elements that perpetuate the existing abnormal situation."" but levin said the legislative action should not be halted for such talks, instead saying ""along with advancing the legislation, we all have enough time to be able to talk and reach understandings before the second and third readings."" netanyahu, speaking in a video message, accused opposition leaders of ""dragging the country into anarchy,"" urging them to ""show responsibility and leadership."" ""i call on the leaders of the opposition: stop it. stop deliberately leading the country into anarchy. get ahold of yourselves, show responsibility and leadership,"" netanyahu said. ""most israeli citizens do not want anarchy. they want a substantive discussion and in the end they want unity."" opposition leaders including former prime minister yair lapid and former defense minister benny gantz addressed the crowds earlier. yohanan plesner, president of the israel democracy institute, said that if the legislation passes, it could result in ""a fundamental change in the nature of israel"" that could have significant social implications down the road. he said a standoff could occur if the supreme court decides to strike down the new legislation, which could then be overridden by parliament and the government, and that move in turn could be deemed illegal by the supreme court. ""and then we will have a constitutional deadlock where there is no agreed upon mechanism for making a decision,"" he told cnn, adding that such a scenario isn't likely for now. ""this, i would say, is a threat that is looming, but we are yet to find out."" the protests are likely to intensify as the bill advances through the knesset, he said. israeli bills need three readings in the knesset before becoming law. additional reporting by amir tal in jerusalem and nadeen ebrahim in abu dhabi.

Second child dies in car ramming attack in Jerusalem,2023-02-10,8.0,"a car drove into several people at a bus stop in jerusalem on friday, killing a man and a young child in what israeli police described as a ""ramming terror attack."" a second child died of his injuries saturday. yaakov yisrael paley, 6, and alter shlomo lederman, 20, died friday at the ramot intersection, an area israel considers to be a neighborhood in northern jerusalem. the boy's brother, 8-year-old asher menachem paley, who was ""critically wounded"" during the attack, died in hospital on saturday, according to a statement by the hospital, shaare zedek. he was pronounced dead after ""many teams from the trauma unit, from the er, pediatric intensive care, pediatric surgery and neurosurgery fought for many hours for his life,"" according to the statement. the 42-year-old father of asher and yaakov was injured in the attack and remains in the hospital in ""moderate"" condition, according to hadassah medical center. his 10-year-old son has been released ""after being treated in the emergency room by the medical team."" two other people were also injured in the incident. the suspect, who was ""neutralized"" at the scene, according to police, was identified as hussein qaraqe, a 31-year-old from east jerusalem. local journalists in the neighborhood reported that israeli police had arrested qaraqe's wife, father and brother, sharing videos of what they said were the arrests. it occurred on land that israel captured from jordan in 1967 and then annexed, so palestinians and many international observers consider it to be a settlement on occupied land. suspect released from hospital just before attack the suspect, qaraqe, had been released from a hospital in tel aviv the night before the incident, his uncle told cnn. he had been in hospitalized for a month due to a back injury, said adnan qaraqe. ""he had a car accident a while ago and severely injured his back which led to more than five surgeries on his spine. he was on very heavy medication and painkillers which affected his nervous system."" qaraqe said he did not know if the hospital where his nephew had stayed was a mental hospital or whether hussein was hospitalized for back pain. he said there would be records at his nephew's house that would clarify, but the house has been sealed by israeli authorities. israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu gave orders on friday for the house to be sealed and demolished. residents of issawiya told cnn that qaraqe was not the owner of the house, but had rented it. israeli national security minister itamar ben gvir also ordered police checks of vehicles in that neighborhood in the wake of the ramming -- and wanted to go further, he said at the scene of the incident. ""i instructed the police to set up roadblocks around issawiya and stop one by one -- one by one -- and to simply check every vehicle. i wanted to do a full closure, but there is a legal question about it - and we will discuss it. in any case, i instructed the police to deploy roadblocks, and they are deploying roadblocks around issawiya,"" he said. us secretary of state antony blinken on friday responded to the incident in a strongly worded statement on friday, saying, ""we strongly condemn today's terrorist attack on civilians, including children, at a bus stop in jerusalem and express our condolences to the families of those killed.""

Opinion: Mitt Romney's moments of truth,2023-02-12,9.0,"more than a decade has passed since mitt romney lost political support during his failed 2012 presidential campaign for boasting about having ""binders full of women"" suitable for government appointments and writing off the ""47% of americans"" who pay no federal income tax. but his remark about russia being america's ""number one geopolitical foe"" — which was widely ridiculed at the time — now seems prescient in the wake of vladimir putin's murderous invasion of ukraine. in the past few years, the senator from utah has earned a reputation for being a rare, candid voice in washington, willing to buck his party. he was the lone republican who voted to remove president donald trump from office in his first impeachment trial and one of seven to do so in trump's second impeachment. minutes before the state of the union speech tuesday, romney encountered the scandal-ridden republican rep. george santos on the house floor and told him what many of the new york congressman's constituents — and others around the country — are saying: ""you don't belong here."" (santos told reporters afterward: ""it wasn't very mormon of him."") even more tellingly, romney broke with his party's stance on china's spy balloon. after a closed-door briefing by administration officials thursday, romney told reporters, ""i believe that the administration, the president, our military and intelligence agencies, acted skillfully and with care,"" and said he agreed with their decision to wait to shoot down the balloon until it moved over the atlantic ocean, off the carolinas. house republicans, who were initially planning a resolution condemning the biden administration for not bringing down the balloon sooner, switched the wording to condemn the government of china for sending the craft over us territory in the first place. it passed 419-0, a small act of bipartisanship only two days after a group of house republicans heckled president joe biden as he was addressing both houses in his annual speech. there are not a lot of romneys — or indeed any — in the ranks of the extreme gopers who bucked their own house speaker's shushing to shout their displeasure at biden's remarks. ""some members of the republican caucus seemed keen to highlight the distinctions between the thoughtful, unity-emphasizing biden and their own party's shameful descent,"" wrote jill filipovic. ""rep. marjorie taylor greene of georgia, among others, repeatedly booed and yelled throughout the speech; when he introduced the parents of tyre nichols, who was last month fatally beaten by memphis police officers, and the ukrainian ambassador, she stayed seated. that perhaps says more than biden ever could."" shushing se cupp called mccarthy's ""shushing"" a ""surprisingly gallant act of leadership from someone who has aligned himself with former president donald trump, voted to overturn the 2020 election results and packed the house oversight committee with election deniers."" ""will he continue to 'shush' the extremist, conspiratorial and 'never biden' wing of his party — whom he has empowered and elevated — as they act out and get in the way of his agenda, which might even include working with biden from time to time?"" geoff duncan, a republican who formerly served as georgia's lieutenant governor, wrote that ""neither the southern border nor inflation received much attention from the president — despite both issues being of importance to voters. neither did the chinese spy balloon, whose coast-to-coast journey undermines biden's tough talk toward chinese president xi jinping."" biden ""was feisty, full of energy, marshaled his arguments effectively and even batted back republican catcalls with good humor,"" observed david gergen. ""by the end of the evening, he looked like a boxer who can't wait to get into the ring again."" ""but he now faces an even sterner test: did he actually move the needle? among presidents of the recent past, a public appearance as powerful as this one could shake up politics. former presidents bill clinton and ronald reagan each had the capacity to change minds when they held a microphone."" the president's ""discussion of 'the talk' that black parents give to their children about how to safely interact with police officers was the most moving part of his speech,"" wrote former rep. mondaire jones, a democrat. ""still, it was political malpractice for him not to explicitly call for congress to pass the george floyd justice in policing act. the family of tyre nichols, a 29-year-old black man who was fatally beaten by memphis police officers last month, deserved to hear it."" populism raul reyes noted that ""biden smartly aligned himself with populist issues, like making wealthy corporations pay their fair share of taxes and proposing that all federal infrastructure projects use american-made materials."" the 80-year-old president's vision was decidedly blue-collar — and 20th century — in its aim to rebuild america's manufacturing base and reduce the reliance on trade with the rest of the world. but, as julian zelizer pointed out, ""times have changed and biden has a tough road ahead. while the president offered a robust vision of how federal investment has and could create jobs in key sectors such as the semi-conductor industry and infrastructure, the kinds of manufacturing jobs that were at the heart of federal investment between the 1930s and 1960s have vastly diminished and are not likely to return."" ""biden needs to acknowledge how his economic populism will address the industries of the 2020s rather than those of the 1950s and 1960s."" biden's success in 2020 owed a lot to the contrast with the chaos and extremism of the trump administration, bill mcgowan and juliana silva wrote. the outbursts by rep. marjorie taylor greene and her colleagues allow biden to surf the same wave now. ""by keeping the hostility factor high, the gop is also paving the way for biden to reuse in 2024 one of his stickiest and most effective campaign messages from 2020: that the election is nothing short of a battle for the 'soul of the nation.' thanks to the new breed of attention-seeking, far-right republicans, biden gets to go back to that well regardless of whether trump is his opponent or not."" the president turned the heckling to his advantage by getting republicans to deny any intention of cutting social security or medicare. ""you can say mr. biden fibbed, misled and exaggerated, and you wouldn't be wrong,"" peggy noonan wrote in the wall street journal, ""but in rope-a-doping republicans on medicare and social security he showed real mastery."" new generation? in ""a scathing rebuke"" to biden's speech that served as the gop's official reply, ""arkansas gov. sarah huckabee sanders said it's time for a new generation of republican leadership,"" alice stewart noted. ""at 40, sanders is the youngest governor in the country. she spoke of biden as the oldest president in american history, and at 80-years-old, she said, he is simply 'unfit to serve as commander in chief.'"" left unsaid was that trump, sanders' former boss, would be 78 by election day, 2024 — and he is running for the presidency again. patrick t. brown spoke for a lot of americans when he pleaded for something other than a biden-trump rematch: ""a 2024 presidential election that features another slugfest between two elderly leaders rather than a scrappy fight between up-and-coming politicians with energy and enthusiasm would be doing the nation a disservice."" ""new polling suggests a growing desire for new faces. 58% of democratic and democratic-leaning registered voters told a washington post/abc news poll they hoped their party nominates someone other than biden in 2024. according to the poll, 49% of republican and republican-leaning voters said the same thing about former president donald trump."" for more: jennifer rodgers: former manhattan prosecutor has given trump a gift john avlon: four key moments from biden's state of the union twitter roundup: biden gets feisty, baits republicans earthquake disaster dr. abdurrahman alomar and his family were jolted awake at 4:17 am monday in their sixth-floor apartment in gaziantep, turkey. a devastating earthquake had struck and they hurried out of the building in their pajamas into snow-filled streets. taking refuge in their car, away from any buildings, alomar spoke to cnn opinion's sheena mckenzie about the toll the quake is taking on a region already devastated by war. alomar is a pediatrician who works as a senior health adviser with the syrian american medical society, providing medical assistance across the border. ""in northwest syria, we are already suffering from a shortage of supplies, and we are now using the regular inventories in our warehouses,"" alomar said. ""so we are in urgent need of additional support to compensate these supplies for regular operations — and also to be ready for aftershocks and more casualties who may come to our hospitals."" in the new york times, turkish author and nobel laureate orhan pamuk wrote, ""aid has been dispatched, but the trucks loaded with supplies are stuck for hours on jammed roads hundreds of miles from the affected areas. people who have lost their homes, their families, their loved ones, everything they ever had find that there is nobody doing anything about the fires beginning to break out in their cities. and so they block the path of any official vehicle, policeman or government employee they can find and start to remonstrate. i have never seen our people so angry."" as of sunday, the death toll in the quake stood at more than 28,000, with tens of thousands injured. zelensky, a year later a year ago, shortly before the russian invasion of ukraine, former comedian-turned-president ""volodymyr zelensky's popularity ratings were tanking as he battled allegations of unmet campaign promises to tackle endemic corruption,"" recalled michael bociurkiw. ""then on february 24, russia's total invasion blasted these concerns into the background. almost overnight, that dark cloud over zelensky vanished as he defied critics, and miraculously pivoted into the role of heroic wartime president and global symbol of defender of the free world."" ""his popularity ratings surged — and have stayed high ever since — currently hovering at around 84%."" but corruption is still pervasive in ukraine, as recent allegations and a new crackdown have shown, and bociurkiw argued that it's vital to keep fighting it.

Opinion: Why Netanyahu is suddenly a lot less friendly with Putin,2023-02-07,10.0,"long before the current war in ukraine began nearly a year ago, israel has maintained strict neutrality in the hostilities between russia and ukraine. that may be about to change. since he came to power at the end of 1999, russian president vladimir putin has gone out of his way to court the israeli leadership. he made sure to hold a meeting at least once a year with the serving israeli prime minister, usually at his residences in sochi or moscow, and every few years he would travel to jerusalem. a former russian diplomat explained to me that ""putin respects strength and sees israel as a strong country with which he wants to be on good terms."" the same is true of israel's leaders, especially of benjamin netanyahu, the country's longest-serving prime minister who returned to office at the end of 2022. netanyahu was so proud of what he claimed was a close relationship with putin that in 2019 he used photographs of them together as part of his election campaign. he has claimed on multiple occasions that their relationship was advantageous to israel's strategic interests. one instance of this was when russia first deployed its military to war-torn syria in september 2015 to prop up president bashar assad's blood-soaked regime. within days, netanyahu was in moscow at the head of a military delegation for an unscheduled meeting with putin. the two leaders reached an agreement whereby israel would continue to operate in syrian airspace but would only attack targets linked to its enemy iran, while leaving assad's forces untouched. a ""deconfliction mechanism,"" including a hotline between the russian command center in syria and israel's air force headquarters, was swiftly established. over the years, senior israeli officials have been at pains to emphasize that while israel's chief strategic ally remains the united states, it was crucial to maintain coordination with the russians. in 2014, despite pressure from washington, israel refused to join the western governments in condemning russia's annexation of crimea. strict neutrality was to be maintained throughout. when russia invaded ukraine on february 24 last year, netanyahu was not in office. the prime minister was naftali bennett and he stuck to the neutrality policy. bennett explained to me that ""we are not in the same position as other countries. we have russia just over our border in syria. we have to take into consideration the presence of large jewish communities in both russia and ukraine which could be impacted. and besides, it's useful for everyone to have a government like israel which has good ties with both sides to serve as a go-between."" in the early weeks of the war, bennett embarked on a peace mission in which he both visited putin in the kremlin and had multiple conversations with ukrainian president vlodymyr zelensky. he insists that ""there was a 50% chance of reaching a ceasefire, sadly it failed."" he also claims that his involvement helped broker short-term local truces, which allowed saving civilians from the war zone. any hope of a ceasefire has long vanished, and ukraine has since publicly requested israel help supply it with arms, especially with missile defense systems like the iron dome. israel has sent humanitarian aid but has refused to send any weapons. in recent months, as russia began using iranian drones to attack ukrainian targets, israel has agreed to supply kyiv, through nato, with intelligence and technical information on how to counter the iranian drone threat. not everyone in the israeli leadership agreed with bennett's neutral policy. his political partner and then-foreign minister yair lapid was more forthright in publicly condemning russian war crimes in ukraine. opinions were divided in the country's security establishment as well. one israeli general told me that ""the fear of russia is overblown and israel could have been much more supportive of ukraine without any fear of retribution."" ten months after the russian invasion, netanyahu returned to office. suddenly he was a lot less friendly toward putin. he took one congratulatory phone call from him a week before his inauguration, but that was all. meanwhile, in media interviews, he has said that he is reconsidering israel's policy on the ukraine war, though he wouldn't specify any details. ""netanyahu has two immediate reasons for changing policy and supporting ukraine,"" a former israeli intelligence officer who was deeply involved in israel's military relationship with russia, told me. ""first, russia has greatly diluted its forces in syria as they were needed in ukraine. the threat to israel from them is now negligible,"" the officer said. ""second, russia is now using iranian drones and missiles on the battlefield and israel now has a valuable opportunity to supply ukraine with defense systems so we can see how well they do in an actual war. one day we may have to face the same iranian weapons,"" the officer added. an israeli diplomat adds another reason why netanyahu would consider supporting ukraine more forcefully. unlike the bennett-lapid government, his new coalition of far-right and ultra-religious parties is regarded with suspicion by the biden administration that has already voiced its displeasure with the new government's plans for a legal overhaul, which drastically weaken the powers and independence of israel's supreme court. last week, us secretary of state antony blinken visited jerusalem, and unlike on such visits in the past, didn't extend the prime minister an invitation to the white house. an israeli shift toward kyiv could be netanyahu's best hope of currying favor with washington.",7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.05032016975539071,0.5328789576888084,0.4168008698948792,0.5313355793391931,0,0,0,0,3.7193490553743516,5.476512389874341,19.0,0.2882374942039127

to the united states geological survey. three of the aftershocks have measured 6.0 or greater, including a magnitude 7.5 earthquake that struck 95 kilometers (59 miles) north of the epicenter of the main quake. the aftershocks stretch for more than 300 kilometers (185 miles) along the fault zone that ruptured in southern turkey, oriented from southwest to northeast and stretching from the border with syria up through the province of malatya.  conditions in northwest syria are “terrifying” in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake on monday, according to eyewitnesses. the quake left “entire families dead” and “survivors sleeping on the streets in the freezing cold,” they told cnn. dr. mostafa edo, a country director for the us-based ngo medglobal – who has lived in idlib for the past three years – spent monday distributing aid to hospitals across syria’s northwest region. he said what made this earthquake particularly terrifying was how long it lasted. “in the building where i live [in idlib], my neighbor lives with his parents, both of whom have a disability. he couldn’t leave home during the earthquake because he had to stay by their side because they couldn’t leave home. they had to stay in place for hours that were absolutely horrific as the earthquake and aftershocks took place,” edo said. he added, “one of my colleagues, who i’ve worked with for more than five years, was killed about two years ago in russian airstrikes. i found out today that his whole family, his wife and kids, all passed away today when their building collapsed.” limited resources to treat wounded: edo said many hospitals in the area are not prepared for emergencies like this, and that his team distributed supplies to hospitals receiving the largest number of patients. there is still a high demand for supplies like orthopedic plates used to treat fractures, but that he and his team couldn’t find enough to meet that demand. “hospitals right now are starting to suffer from electricity outages. a great number of hospitals, which were relying on electricity supplies from turkey over the years, will now have to start depending on generators, which require diesel,” edo said, adding that cities he traveled to on monday including harem, darkush, kafr takharim and tal mileh, have been “particularly difficult” because paramedics are unable to use heavy machinery to help with rescue operations “due to fears that people are still alive under the rubble of buildings that have totally collapsed.” khalil ashawi, a photojournalist based in jindayris in syria’s northwest, said that in his 10 years of covering the war in syria, he hasn’t witnessed scenes as disastrous as the ones he witnessed monday. “it’s a disaster. paramedics and firefighters are trying to help, but unfortunately, there is too much for them to deal with. they can’t handle it all,"" ashawi said. “entire families have been killed. seven to eight people from the same family, all gone. these are the sort of situations i am seeing and hearing about today,” he said. “it is freezing at the moment, and there are so many people sleeping in the streets right now because they have no homes to go to,” ashawi added. ashawi’s family is based in turkey. he says his mom and dad, who live in antakya, have been missing since monday morning. more than 2,700 people have been killed and thousands more injured after a powerful magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck turkey and syria early monday. officials continue to update the death toll as rescue efforts continue. ##syria## palestinian civil defense and medical teams will be sent to turkey and syria to help in rescue operations following the deadly earthquake that rocked the region, the palestinian authority's prime minister, muhammad shtayyeh, said

victims,"" shtayyeh said. ##turkey## ##syria## after turkey and syria experienced the 7.8 magnitude earthquake, us geological survey recorded more than 60 aftershocks, including a major one at 7.5 magnitude. remember: all aftershocks are individual earthquakes, but as long as they are not stronger that the original, main quake, they are considered aftershocks. here's where these aftershocks struck: ##turkey## ##syria## president joe biden will speak with turkish president recep tayyip erdogan “very soon,” the white house said monday, as turkey reels from a devastating earthquake that left thousands dead and at least 14,000 people injured. “we anticipate the president and president erdogan will have an opportunity to speak very soon and we will certainly have a readout when that conversation occurs,” white house press secretary karine jean-pierre told reporters at an afternoon press briefing. the two leaders last spoke in person at the g20 summit in november. the death toll across turkey and syria has risen to at least 2,724 after a powerful 7.8 magnitude earthquake rocked turkey and syria early monday. the total number of injured climbed to13,580, based on information provided by various agencies.turkey has at least11,119injured people and syria has 2,461 injured people following the quake. the total death toll in syria rose to 1,073. news agency sana reports 593

climbed to 1,651, according to turkey's vice president fuat oktay. ##turkey## ##syria## this is cnn journalist eyad kourdi's first-hand account of experiencing the 7.8 magnitude earthquake in gaziantep, turkey: it was just after 4:15 a.m. and my parents woke up in terror, screaming as theground shook underneathus. i shouted at them to take cover. “it’s going to be over soon, it’s going to be over soon,” i yelled, even as it felt like it would never end. i wasn’t too worried at first. it’s just another minor earthquake, the kind we feel every couple of months around here, i thought. but just a few seconds later, it became so shaky that furniture was falling over and i could hear objects smashing. the force felt like somebody trying to knock me over, i could feel the violent reverberations in my chest. i fell to the ground. the shaking kept going. it was minutes before it finally stopped. we ran out of the house, in our pajamas and slippers. it was freezing cold and pouring down with rain. there was snow on the ground. the whole neighborhood was in the streets. twenty minutes in, just as we thought it may be over, the first aftershocks came. i counted 11, one after another. i rushed back inside to grab some coats and proper boots and we jumped into a car to move into an open area, away from the buildings. i heard ambulances and fire trucks heading into the old town, which is fullof older, more fragile structures. the aftershocks kept coming during the day. some were unbelievably strong. one struck when i was right next to a badly damaged large building. a civil defense official shouted at everybody to run. later, i drove to pazarcık, a town of 35,000 people that’s closer to the epicenter. it felt like armageddon. there’s at least one completely destroyed building in every single street. i stayed in pazarcık for 30 minutes and, in that short time, i felt four aftershocks. it didn’t seem safe to stay, so i drove back to gaziantep. that’s when the ground started trembling again. it felt biblical. everybody ran out of their cars. the shaking was so strong that i was barely able to stay on my feet. the water in the ditch next to the road was violently thrashing back and forth like in a storm. in gaziantep, we are sheltering inside a mosque where it’s safer than in our house. municipal workers have been distributing water, bread and warm rice. i know it would be even safer to stay outside, in case there are more aftershocks. but the temperature is just above freezing. my parents can’t stay in the open. eyad kourdi reported from gaziantep and ivana kottasova wrote from london. ##turkey## several archeological sites in syria were damaged following thepowerfulearthquake that shook the region on monday morning, according to

country, the russian defense ministry said in a statement on monday. russian defense minister sergei shoigu “instructed the commander of the russian (forces) in syria to provide assistance,"" according to the statement. the ministry said that russian soldiers are mainly assisting in the cities of aleppo, hama and latakia. the servicemen are clearing debris, searching for victims and providing them with medical assistance, the statement said. earlier on monday, russian president vladimir putin pledged assistance to turkey and syria in the aftermath of the deadly earthquake. some background: russia is the strongest foreign power operating in syria, and putin has long allied himself with syrian president bashar al-assad, throwing the full weight of the russian military behind the syrian army. ##syria## turkish president recep tayyip erdogan declared seven days of national mourning due to the earthquake. erdogan wrote in his tweet, ""due to the earthquakes that took place in our country on february 6, 2023, a national mourning period was declared for seven days. our flag will fly at half-mast until sunset on sunday, february 12, 2023, all over our country and within

kewara, the turkey director for the syrian american medical society (sams), spoke to cnn from his car after he and his family took refuge in it and described the “horrible” earthquake that hit turkey and syria. “i am talking with you from my car,"" kewara told cnn’s becky anderson. he said he’d been in his vehicle since 5 a.m. local time, more than 14 hours, with his family, including his kids.the earthquake was “something horrible,"" he added.“this is our first time to experience such a thing.and the weather condition is very difficult.” sams is anngo that provides medical care to help syrians on the frontlines of war or in this case natural disaster,and kewara runs the operation that serves northwest syria from its base in gaziantep in southern turkey. kewara, who is syrian, also said that after 11 years serving syrians, “this is our first time to see ourselves directly with the victims.” kewara continued: “previously we were responding to them and supporting them from our central office in gaziantep. today, we are victims like them. directly we experience the same earthquake, horrible earthquake.but fortunately, we have vehicles.we can stay in our vehicles. but the people in northwest syria, 4.5 million are idps (internally displaced persons) coming from different areas because of the 11-year war in syria.” he went on to say that because of the “very very poor infrastructure,"" “everything is run by ngos” in northwest syria. mazen also drew a clear distinction between turkey’s capabilities in dealing with the earthquake, versus the situation in northwest syria. “things that the turkish government can do for its people, the people of northwest syria lack,"" he told cnn. he also said that sams alone had dealt with 180 earthquake deaths and 800 casualties. ##turkey## ##syria## the death toll across turkey and syria has risen to at least 2,509 following a powerful 7.8 magnitude earthquake with its epicenter in southern turkey early monday.

to turkey's vice president fuat oktay. there are now 9,733 people injured in turkey, oktay also said. turkey has at least 9,733 and syria has 2,403 injured people following the devastating earthquake. ##turkey## ##syria## at least 54 aftershocks measuring 4.3 or greater have occurred since the 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck southern turkey on monday morning local time, according to the united states geological survey, which is a scientific agency of the us government. three of the aftershocks have measured 6.0 or greater, including the massive 7.5 magnitude earthquake that struck 95 kilometers (about 59 miles) north of the epicenter of the morning’s main quake. the aftershocks stretch for more than 300 kilometers (186 miles) along the fault zone that ruptured in southern turkey, oriented from southwest to northeast and stretching from the border with syria up through the province of malatya. ##turkey## a white helmets volunteer working through the devastation in syria says the organization does not have enough to handle this disaster. ""our teams are working around the clock to help to save the injured people. but our capabilities, our powers are not enough tohandle this disaster. this disaster is bigger than any organization in northwestsyria,"" ismail alabdullah told cnn.

""most of them were displacedfrom other parts of syriaduring the last 12 years ofbombing and killing,"" he said, adding that any help they receive will be spent on saving people ""from under the rubble."" many syrians have been displaced as many as 20 times, according to international rescue committee's mark kaye, who spoke to cnn earlier monday. before daylight, alabdullah said the team on ground thought it could handle the impact, which it assumed would be limited to a few sites. however, when daylight revealed the large scale of devastation, he said, ""we were shocked."" ""what do we need most right nowis for us as rescue workers is heavy equipment that helps us inremoving mountains of rubble,"" he told cnn. ""we need medical supplies forthose who we saved fromunder the rubble.all of this is the urgent need for us. alabdullah said he hopes that countries ""believe in humanvalues and human rights"" and send supportto syria. ""we don't want to see thatpeople stay under the rubblefor weeks or days.we need immediate response fromeveryone, so we can help and endthis disaster ... we don't want to see [more] peopledying

condolences and “offered to provide the syrian side with the necessary assistance in eliminating the consequences of this disaster” which assad accepted, according to the kremlin. “bashar al-assad accepted this offer with gratitude, and in the next few hours, rescuers from the russian emergencies ministry will fly to syria,” the kremlin readout went on to say. some background: russia is the strongest foreign power operating in syria, and putin has long allied himself with assad, throwing the full weight of the russian military behind the syrian army. ##syria## ##turkey## the region of northwest syria, which was impacted by the deadly earthquake on monday, has 4.1 million people who rely on humanitarian assistance, according to the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs (ocha) on monday. the majority of these people are women and children and along with the devastation from the earthquake, syrian communities are battling an ongoing cholera outbreak amid a harsh winter with heavy rain and snow over the weekend, ocha said in its statement. “the un and partners are monitoring the situation on the ground amidst information flow constraints due to chronic telecommunication disruptions and power shortages. infrastructural damages are difficult to assess at this time and roads have been reportedly blocked in both türkiye and north-west syria,” ocha added. at least 820 people are reported dead in syria following the 7.8 magnitude earthquake on monday. the syrian arab news agency (sana) reports 430 deaths across government-controlled areas and the ""white helmets"" group, officially known as the syria civil defense, reported 390 deaths in opposition-controlled areas. here are some visuals from the ground: ##syria## a cnn producer said that the aftershocks of monday’s powerful earthquake in turkey were “like armageddon.” “i actually don’t believe i made it out,"" said eyad kourdi, who was in gaziantep when the initial earthquake struck. when the tremors began, kourdi said his parents screamed and that he did his best to calm them down, assuring them it would be over soon. the situation was ""even more catastrophic"" in the neighboring town of pazarcik, where kourdi visited, adding that as he was leaving he witnessed people running out of dozens of cars during a major aftershock, which measured 7.5 in magnitude. while returning to gaziantep, kourdi reported seeing five kilometers (more than three miles) of traffic as people queued to evacuate the city. ##turkey## the death toll across turkey and syria has risen to at least 2,361 after a powerful 7.8 magnitude earthquake rocked southern turkey early monday. the total death toll in turkey has climbed to 1,541, according to turkey's vice president fuat oktay. there are now 9,733 people injured in turkey, oktay also said. the total death toll in syria is 820. the syrian arab news agency (sana) reports 430 deaths across government-controlled areas and the ""white helmets"" group, officially known as the syria civil defense, reported 390 deaths in opposition-controlled areas. ##syria## ##turkey## spain and france each announced monday they will send rescue workers to turkey to assist in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake. a total of 139 french civil security rescue workers will fly to turkey on monday evening to assist with search and rescue efforts, france’s interior minister gerald darmanin said. in atweet, darmanin said the response came “at the request of the president of the republic,” and is “part of the european solidarity mechanism.” “france stands in full solidarity with turkey in these terrible circumstances,” the minister added. spain will send a group of 85 specialists to turkey on monday to support search and rescue operations, the country's interior ministry said in a statement. one team, with 50 members from the defense ministry's military emergencies unit, will leave from the moron air force base in southern spain, according to the ministry. a second team, with 35 members from the madrid regional government's emergency response unit, will leave on a flight from the torrejon air force base near madrid. the european union mechanism for civil protection has confirmed turkey's acceptance of this aid from spain, the ministry added. an israeli security source told cnn that syria asked russia to convey a request for earthquake aid to israel, but a syrian source denied this claim. a request of that kind would be extraordinary: israel and syria are formally at war and have no diplomatic relations. an israeli diplomatic source said he was not aware of any previous request for aid from a country it was formally at war with. israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu had announced earlier on monday that he had approved a request from “a diplomatic element” for aid to syria, and that he assumed it would be acted on “in the near future.” an unnamed syrian official source then categorically denied there had been such a request, telling a pro-government media outlet al-watan, “it is disgraceful that netanyahu exploits the catastrophe of the earthquake that struck syria to mislead public opinion and cover up the expansionist and aggressive policies of the occupation.” israel regularly sends search and rescue teams around the world in the wake of disasters. israel formally offered aid to lebanon in the wake of the devastating beirut port explosion of 2020, but lebanon – also officially at war with israel – did not accept. ##syria## us president joe biden has “authorized an immediate u.s. response” in the aftermath of a powerful magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck turkey and syria overnight. “jill and i were deeply saddened by the news of the devastating earthquakes that have thus far claimed thousands of lives in turkiye and syria. my administration has been working closely with our nato ally turkiye, and i authorized an immediate u.s. response,” biden said in a statement monday morning as cnn is learning that more than 2,000 people have been killed and rescue and recovery efforts continue. senior us officials, he said, are coordinating their turkish counterparts on assistance needs. “our teams are deploying quickly to begin to support turkish search and rescue efforts and address the needs of those injured and displaced by the earthquake,” biden said. he added that “u.s.-supported humanitarian partners are also responding to the destruction in syria.” the president expressed condolences to those impacted by the earthquake. qatar and kuwait will set up an air bridge for the flow of humanitarian aid into turkey. qatar’s emir sheikh tamim bin hamad al-thani said qatar’s international search and rescue group (qsart) will fly to turkey through the air bridge as soon as monday, carrying with them specialized rescue and search vehicles, and relief aid, tents and winter supplies to set up field hospitals upon arrival, qatar news agency (qna) said. kuwait’s emir sheikh nawaf al-ahmad al-jaber al-sabah also ordered the establishment of the air bridge to send “urgent aid and medical staff,” kuwait news agency (kuna) said in a statement. ##turkey##  the 7.8 magnitude earthquake that hit turkey and syria on monday has led to a “catastrophic situation” in syria, an official of the international rescue committee (irc) told cnn. “what we are seeing inside syria really is a catastrophic situation,” said mark kaye, irc's policy, advocacy and communications director for middle east and north africa. the earthquake has made the situation worse for the already vulnerable and displaced populations in syria, specifically the rural areas, kaye said. “for this area, you have to remember: this population [was] already highly vulnerable. they have a huge amount of people who have already been displaced — sometimes as many as 20 times ... almost the majority of them are women and children, particularly vulnerable to the harsh weather and this earthquake,” kaye said. displaced people living in makeshift camps are facing freezing winds and the camps are not equipped to withstand an earthquake of this intensity, he added. “so today you will be seeing a lot of people being pulled out from the rubble. i think what we are really concerned about as well is those who have survived ... whether the health system is going to be able to really come to grip with that and not be completely overburdened,” kaye told cnn. power cuts and a lack of communication across northern syria have made search operations difficult, particularly in rural areas where the infrastructure is not built to withstand such a powerful earthquake, he explained. he commended countries’ offers to send help to turkey but said those commitments should translate to syria as well, expressing concern that the ""search and rescue operation really isn’t fit"" for addressing the large numbers of people that may be affected. ##syria## the un is ready to support emergency response efforts following the deadly earthquake in turkey and syria, un secretary-general antonio guterres tweeted on monday. “i am deeply saddened by the news of the devastating earthquakes in türkiye & syria, and offer my heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims,” he wrote. rescuers are now searching for survivors after the powerful magnitude 7.8 earthquake shook the region, leaving more than 2,000 people dead and thousands more injured. more than a dozen provinces in eastern turkey are under yellow and orange weather warnings through tuesday, which are level 1 and 2 out of 3, according to theturkish state meteorological services website. these weather warnings have been issued due to snowy and windy conditions including the provinces of osmaniye, kahramanmaras, adiyaman, and malatya, which have been experiencing several aftershocks over the last 12 hours. gaziantep, where the original 7.8 magnitude earthquake occurred, is not included under any weather warnings, however, scattered rain showers and potential snow flurries are possible through tuesday morning local time. temperatures are currently running around 5 to 8 degrees celsius below average across the region. low temperatures near the main earthquake’s epicenter are forecast to drop over the next couple of days. by tuesday morning, temperatures will hover around the freezing mark but by wednesday and thursday morning temperatures will be several degrees below zero. ##turkey## while turkey and syria are reeling from the aftermath of the powerful 7.8 magnitude earthquake, the impact was felt as far as lebanon and israel. take a look: at least 1,498 people have died and 8,533 people were injured in turkey after the devastating earthquake ripped through turkey and syria, according to yunus sezer, the head of turkey's disaster and emergency management agency (afad). there are 15,000 rescue personnel working in the region, and due to the bad weather, they are using helicopters and planes to reach the earthquake locations, sezer said. at least 2,834 buildings were damaged, and authorities are working on providing shelter for the citizens for the night, the official added. ##turkey## us secretary of state antony blinken expressed“deep sadness at the tragic loss of life and destruction” in turkey and syria due to the earthquake. “we extend our condolences to the families of those affected and are assessing our comprehensive response options.i have directed my team to remain in close contact with our turkish allies and our humanitarian partners in the coming days to determine what the region needs,” blinken said in a statement monday. he noted that an ""initial response"" from the us is already underway, and committed toproviding assistance ""in the days, weeks, and months ahead."" at least 120 aftershocks have occurred following monday’s powerful earthquake in southern turkey, according to an update from turkey's disaster and emergency management agency (afad). remember: all aftershocks are individual earthquakes. but as long as they are not stronger than the original, main quake, they are considered aftershocks. separately, the united states geological survey (usgs), which only reports the more significant aftershocks that are actually felt by those in the earthquake zone, reported at least 43 aftershocks of 4.3 or greater magnitude. three of the aftershocks measured 6.0 or greater, including the massive 7.5 magnitude earthquake that struck 95 kilometers (59 miles) north of the epicenter of the morning’s main quake, according to usgs. the aftershocks stretch for more than 300 kilometers (about 186 miles) along the fault zone that ruptured in southern turkey — oriented from southwest to northeast and stretching from the border with syria up through the province of malatya. ##turkey## turkey has sent a formal request to nato and allies for assistance in dealing with the aftermath of monday's earthquake. the country has requested medical assistance and equipment, various urban search and rescue units as well as ""extreme weather-proof fully equipped field hospitals with technical personnel for assembly."" the response is being coordinated by nato's euro-atlantic disaster response coordination centre, which is based at nato headquarters in brussels. ##turkey## the death toll

earthquake.” the czech republic is sending a 68-person specialized search and rescue team to turkey following a request for help from the turkish side, the fire rescue services of the czech republic said monday. an official from the fire service said the usar (urban search and rescue) team specializes in earthquake search and rescue, and is fully equipped and trained for operations that include

fallen buildings. here are the latest developments: devastating death toll: at least 1,504 people have died across the two nations. about 5,385 people were injured in turkey, president recep tayyip erdoğan said. syrian state news agency sana reported 1,089 injuries there, while the ""white helmets"" group reported at least 419 injuries in opposition-controlled areas of syria.mammoth aftershock: a major aftershock measuring 7.5 in magnitude hit turkey at 1:24 p.m. local time (5:24 a.m. et), according to the united states geological survey (usgs). it is the largest of the more than 30 aftershocks to strike so far. refugees impacted: hundreds of thousands of syrian refugees, displaced by the civil war in their home country, are settled in the regions of turkey that have been worst hit. world leaders offer aid: azerbaijan will send a search and rescue team of 370 people and aid material to turkey, while the netherlands said it will send 15 metric tons of search and rescue equipment. german technical aid agency thw also said is preparing to deploy aid to the region. challenging weather conditions: with a cold and wet weather system moving through the region, poor conditions are likely to impact the post-quake rescue and recovery efforts in southern turkey and northern syria on monday, according to cnn meteorologists. ##catch up## dr. mazen kewara, turkey director of the syrian american medical society (sams), spoke live on cnn from near the earthquake’s epicenter in gaziantep, where he and his family were taking shelter in their car. kewara said that their car was the safest place for them to be at present. “we cannot use the buildings anymore. maybe for hours. maybe until tomorrow. i don’t know.” turkey continues to be struck by aftershocks – some nearly as strong as the initial earthquake – meaning it is not safe to be inside. “next to my building, about 200-300 meters away, there’s a collapsed building. there are many buildings that have collapsed in gaziantep,” said kewara. sams is a medical relief organization, working in syria and neighboring countries. but their efforts to provide support will be hampered by the damage to buildings. “we have four of our hospitals damaged severely by the earthquake. we have evacuated two of them,” said kewara, who is originally from damascus, syria. the ongoing aftershocks will make it “very, very, very challenging for us as a humanitarian organization to be able to respond” to those in need. for now, kewara and five others remain sheltered in his car, waiting for the tremors to stop. ##syria## responding to reports of a 7.5 magnitude aftershock following the first quake in southern turkey this morning, cnn’s meteorologist and severe weather expert chad myers explained why the aftershocks have been so severe. the 7.5 aftershock was “an earthquake in itself,” myers told cnn's this morning. “it would have been the strongest earthquake since 1999 in the region.” we always talk about the epicenter, but in this case we should talk about the epi-line. two massive tectonic plates – the arabian and the eurasian – meet underneath turkey’s southeastern provinces. along this fault line, “about 100 miles from one side to the other, the earth slipped,” said myers. seismologists refer to this event as a “strike slip” – “where the plates are touching, and all of a sudden they slide sideways,” said myers. this is unlike the ring of fire, which runs along the west coast of the united states. in this zone, earthquakes and tsunamis are often caused by subduction – where one plate slides below another. but in a “strike slip,” the plates move horizontally, rather than vertically. “why that matters is because the buildings don’t want to go back and forth. and then the secondary waves begin to go back and forth as well,” said myers. because of the nature of this seismic event, aftershocks could last ""for weeks and months,"" according to cnn meteorologist karen maginnis. the netherlands will fly 15 metric tons (16.5 imperial tons) of search and rescue equipment to turkey monday, following the deadly 7.8 magnitude earthquake there. “it is expected that at the end of the afternoon, a cargo plane with 15 tons of heavy rescue equipment and other supplies will depart for turkey from eindhoven,” the urban search and rescue team said on its website. the departure time for 65 rescue workers and eight search dogs is still unknown, the organization said. dutch foreign minister wopke hoekstra said earlier that the search and rescue team will include ""police and military personnel, first aid responders, and firefighters."" “shocked by the news of the devastating earthquake in türkiye and syria. our thoughts are with the victims, their families, and the many injured turks and syrians,"" hoekstra added. a powerful earthquake rocked turkey early monday, killing more than 1,500 people and injuring thousands more across the country and neighboring syria. photos showing the true scale of the disaster emerged as the day broke. entire city blocks were flattened by the quake, metal rods were strewn across the streets and vehicles toppled over. rescuers are still working to free people trapped under the rubble. ##turkey## ##syria## german technical aid agency thw is preparing to deploy aid to the region affected by monday's deadly earthquake, which has killed at least 1,500 people and injured thousands more in turkey and syria. thw will deliver tents, blankets and emergency power generators, according to government spokesman maximilian kall. after speaking with turkish ambassador to berlinahmet başar şen, german interior minister nancy faeser vowed to send all the help needed, kall said. turkey has asked for a european civil protection team to be deployed, he added. meanwhile, nato and the eu have offered to send help following the disaster, according to turkish presidentrecep tayyip erdoğan. at least 1,504 people have been killed in turkey and syria, and thousands more injured, after a powerful 7.8 magnitude earthquake rocked southern turkey early monday. in syria, a total of at least 592 people have died, including 371 mostly in the regions of aleppo, hama, latakia and tartus, according to syrian state news agency sana, which also reported 1,089 injuries. meanwhile, the ""white helmets"" group, officially known as the syria civil defense, also reported at least 221 deaths and 419 injuries in opposition-controlled areas of northwestern syria. “hundreds remain trapped under rubble,” the white helmetsaddedon twitter. in turkey, at least 912 people have died and 5,385 people were injured, turkey's president recep tayyip erdoğan said in a televised address monday. rescuers are working through the rubble of collapsed buildings to locate survivors, while nato, the eu and 45 countries have offered assistance following the disaster. a major aftershock measuring 7.5 in magnitude struck turkey at 1:24 p.m. local time (5:24 a.m. et), after a devastating 7.8 magnitude earthquake rocked the region early monday. the aftershock is located approximately 95 kilometers (60 miles) north of the original quake that struck a little over nine hours earlier in southern turkey, according to the united states geological survey (usgs). this is the largest of the more than 30 aftershocks to strike so far. this is a preliminary estimate on the earthquake magnitude and is subject to change. the 7.5 magnitude earthquake is considered an aftershock of the earlier 7.8 magnitude quake. all aftershocks are individual earthquakes, but as long as they are not stronger that the original, main quake, they are considered aftershocks. this aftershock was extremely shallow, only 10 km deep, which worsens the shaking felt. the main quake was 17.9 km deep. before this morning’s 7.8, the 7.5 magnitude earthquake would have been the most powerful to strike turkey since the 1999 izmit quake that killed at least 17,000 people. more than 1,500 people have died across turkey and syria following monday's quake, with thousands more injured in both countries. at least 1,388 people have died across turkey and syria, after a huge 7.8 magnitude earthquake swept across southern turkey early monday, injuring thousands more people in both countries. in syria, at least 476 people have died, including 326 mostly in the regions of aleppo, hama, latakia and tartus, according to syrian state news agency, which also reported at least 1,042 injuries. out of those who lost their lives, at least 139 were in latakia, its governor told syrian state tv. meanwhile, the ""white helmets"" group, officially known as the syria civil defense, also reported at least 150 deaths and 350 injuries in opposition-controlled areas of northwestern syria. in turkey, at least 912 people have died and 5,385 people were injured, turkey's president recep tayyip erdoğan said in a televised address monday. a cnn eyewitness said aftershocks were still being felt hours after the earthquake. photos have also emerged showing the disastrous aftermath of the quake, with entire buildings collapsed and cars toppled over. rescuers are working through the debris of fallen infrastructure to search for survivors, while the port of iskenderun in southern turkey and some airport runways have been damaged. earthquakes are measured using seismographs, which monitor the seismic waves that travel through the earth after a quake. scientists used the richter scale for many years but now largely follow the modified mercalli intensity scale, which the us geological survey says is a more accurate measure of size. the richter scale measures magnitude, whereas the mmi scale measures intensity. here are themagnitude classes, according to thecalifornia earthquake authority: magnitude and intensity conceptualize earthquakes differently. the california institute of technology explains: to scientists, an earthquake is an event inside the earth. to the rest of us, it is an extraordinary movement of the ground. magnitude measures the former, while intensity measures the latter. a humanitarian organization in syria has made a plea for urgent assistance from the international community. speaking on cnn's this morning show, rahaf aboud, head of communications at the syrian arab red crescent, called for “the support of the european union, the united nations, and the international community in response to the devastating earthquake that took place in syria.” aboud requested that these organizations “provide the necessary resources and support, including shelter, food, medical care, and other essential supplies.” “we hope that the un will respond to this call for support to alleviate the suffering of those who have been impacted by this earthquake through cross-line intervention,” aboud said, speaking live from damascus, syria. this morning, volunteers from the syrian arab red crescent are at affected sites in hama, aleppo and lattakia, responding to people trapped in the buildings that collapsed as a result of the earthquake. hundreds of thousands of syrian refugees, displaced by the war in their home country, are settled in the regions of turkey that have been worst hit by this morning’s earthquake. turkey shelters more than 3.6 million syrian refugees, according to data from human rights watch. many of these refugees settled along the turkish-syrian border. the hatay, gaziantep and sanliurfa provinces are each home to more than 300,000 syrians, according to data from the united nations high commissioner for refugees. other neighboring provinces also shelter hundreds of thousands more refugees, who have fled their home country since the beginning of the syrian civil war in 2011. the turkish government has received offers of assistance from the the north atlantic treaty organization (nato), the european union and 45 countries following the devastating earthquake that struck southern turkey early monday. turkish presidentrecep tayyip erdoğan announced the news in a televised address monday, adding that at least912 people

Israel targets Gaza with airstrikes after intercepting rocket attack,2023-02-02,13.0,"israel carried out airstrikes in gaza early on thursday after intercepting a rocket attack from the coastal enclave, the israel defense forces (idf) said. in a twitter post, the idf said israeli fighter jets targeted a chemical production site and a weapons manufacturing facility owned by hamas, the palestinian militant group that runs gaza. ""the idf holds hamas responsible for all terrorism activity emanating from gaza and it will face the consequences of the security violations against israel,"" the idf wrote. on wednesday, the idf reported that one rocket fired from gaza had been intercepted by the idf aerial defense array. on thursday, it released two videos of the airstrikes, filmed in black and white, that showed huge plumes of dark smoke in the air and pieces of debris falling to the ground. it's not clear whether there were any casualties. the official palestinian news & information agency reported that f-16 warplanes had launched at least five missiles at a ""site"" in the central gaza strip, setting it on fire and damaging nearby homes. two missiles also hit agricultural land in the central area, it said. the strike comes after a period of bloodshed on both sides. last thursday israeli forces killed nine palestinians and wounded several others in the west bank city of jenin, in the deadliest day for palestinians in the occupied west bank in nearly two years. this was followed by a shooting near a jerusalem synagogue friday night, which israel has deemed one of its worst terror attacks in recent years. it also follows us secretary of state antony blinken's trip to israel and the west bank this week, which some had hoped would help cool rising tensions. the biden administration has been careful in its language and sought to publicly avoid criticizing the new government in israel, which is led by prime minister benjamin netanyahu and includes controversial far-right ministers. on wednesday, blinken reiterated the administration's goal of a two-state solution for israelis and palestinians, and said the us ""will continue to oppose anything that puts that goal further from reach."" last year was the deadliest for both palestinians in the west bank and for israelis in nearly two decades, cnn analysis of official statistics on both sides showed.",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.8980667591094971,0.06921463459730148,0.032718583941459656,-1.0,0,0,0,0,-1.0,3.677401519405177,14.0,0.2626715371003698
"February 1, 2023 Russia-Ukraine news",2023-01-31,14.0,"our live coverage of russia's war in ukraine has moved here. more than 100 police officers are working to rescue people from the rubble after a missile attack in kramatorsk, ukraine, according to donetsk region police. the strike killed at least 3 people, police said. ""russian troops targeted the residential area of the city with an 'iskander-k' missile. at least 8 apartment buildings were damaged, one of them was completely destroyed. preliminarily, it is known about 3 dead civilians and 20 wounded. people may remain under the rubble,"" the police said on telegram. the attack happened at 9:45 p.m. local time wednesday. a search and rescue operation is underway. authorities are evacuating people to a local school for shelter. in the town of krasnohorivka, ukraine, grim soviet-era apartment buildings stand nearly but not quite empty, with only a few residents remaining. blocks on the southern edges of town are burned shells, windows shattered and awnings dangling in the winter breeze. houses are largely shuttered; their tenants long gone. the central square is abandoned and eerie. on wednesday, a few civilians moved gingerly along icy pavements to a small store that seemed still to be open. a man cycled past with a load of firewood. then arussian rocket propelled grenade burst in the ice-grey sky above — a reminder of the potent threat carried by the enemy. while the world’s attention has been focused on the city ofbakhmutas the vortex of the conflict in ukraine, fighting between russian and ukrainian forces has been as relentless elsewhere. areas south and west of the city of donetsk — particularly the towns of krasnohorivka and vuhledar — have seen combat for much of the war: a punishing mix of trench warfare and longer-range rocket fire as each side probes for weaknesses. progress here for the russians is vital if they are to realize president vladimir putin’s goal of winning all of the donetsk region. at the moment, they are going nowhere. just to the north of krasnohorivka, an elaborate system of trenches marks ukraine’s forward defensive positions. more than two meters deep in the dark brown earth, the trenches extend for hundreds of meters, and in some places are within half a kilometer of russian positions. in the distance, a huge snow-covered slag heap rises out of the mist, like a ski slope in the wrong place. a ukrainian commander, who gave his first name as bogdan, describes the situation as “controlled but tense” — a euphemism favored by the ukrainian military for “very active.” “the enemy is always searching for weak spots, but they don’t find them because we have a very durable defense,” bogdan says. “any enemy attempts are cut down immediately.” his unit says it likes to take the fight to the enemy rather than wait to attack, to try to sap the russians’ morale. as they fired wednesday, the men occasionally yelled to each other: “best job in the world.” read more here. ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky condemned the russian strike that hit a residential building in kramatorsk late wednesday. ""this is not a repetition of history; this is the daily reality of our country. a country bordering absolute evil.and a country that has to overcome it in order to reduce to zero the likelihood of such tragedies happening again,"" he said on his official telegram channel. ""we will definitely find and punish all the perpetrators. they do not deserve mercy,"" he concluded. zelensky expressed condolences to the families and friends of the victims. at least two people were killed and eight were wounded. advocacy group human rights watch (hrw) has urged ukraine to investigate its military’s ""apparent"" use of rocket-fired antipersonnel landmines in and around the eastern city of izium when russian forces occupied the area. in newresearchpublished tuesday, hrw said it documented ""numerous cases in which rockets carrying pfm antipersonnel mines, also called 'butterfly mines' or 'petal mines,' were fired into russian-occupied areas near russian military facilities."" “ukrainian forces appear to have extensively scattered landmines around the izium area, causing civilian casualties and posing an ongoing risk,” arms division director at hrw steve goose said.“russian forces have repeatedly used antipersonnel mines and committed atrocities across the country, but this doesn’t justify ukrainian use of these prohibited weapons,"" goose added. ""the use of antipersonnel mines violates international humanitarian law because they cannot discriminate between civilians and combatants,"" hrw said. ukraine's ministry of foreign affairs has said the report will be ""duly analyzed by the relevant ukrainian institutions."" ""ukraine, exercising its right to self-defense in accordance with article 51 of the un charter, fully fulfills its international obligations against the background of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide of the ukrainian people committed by the russian occupiers,"" the ministry said in response to the hrw report. ukrainian forces retook izium in september 2022, after six months of russian occupation, marking a huge strategic loss for the russian military. at least two people were killed and eight wounded late wednesday after russian forces shelled the eastern ukrainian city of kramatorsk, officials said. ""two hours ago, russian occupants hit a residential building in the city center with a missile and completely destroyed it,"" pavlo kyrylenko, the head of the donetsk region military administration said on his telegram channel. ""rescuers, law enforcement, and public utilities are working at the scene to dismantle the rubble of the destroyed building. it is possible that there may be people under the rubble,"" he said. in a statement, the prosecutor general's office said eight people ""sustained injuries of varying severity."" andriy yermak, the head of the office of the president of ukraine, said russia had targeted civilians. he added: ""russia is a terrorist state."" see the tweet: this post was updated with the latest casualty report. ukrainian president volodymyrzelenskysaid on wednesday he would make as many personnel changes as necessary to guarantee the rule of law. his words come after ukrainian authorities conducted a series of anti-corruption searches and crackdowns across the country – including a search tied to the helicopter crash last month that left the country’s interior minister dead – to combat what they described as “the internal enemy"" in the country. hours after zelensky promised “new reforms,” ukrainian authorities conducted a series of anti-corruption searches, according to the country’s parliamentary majority leader. ""i thank all law enforcement officers who have demonstrated the strength of law and the state today. i am grateful to the government of ukraine for its prompt personnel response. in particular, today, the heads of customs were dismissed,"" zelensky said in his daily address. ""unfortunately, in some areas, the only way to guarantee the rule of law is to change the leadership along with institutional changes. changing as much as necessary to ensure that people do not get dirty in their positions,"" the president said. ""the purity of processes within the ministry of defense and the defense forces, in general, is especially important. any internal supply, any procurement – everything must be absolutely as clean and honest as external supplies for our defense. those who interfere with this will not remain in the relevant structures,"" zelensky added. cnn's mick krever contributed to this report ##corruption

part of an effort to combat what they described as “the internal enemy” in the country. the raids come as president volodymyr zelensky said his government is working on “new reforms” that will make the country “more human, transparent and effective” as he prepares to meet european union officials on friday for talks on ukraine’s possible accession to the bloc. here are key things to know about the raids: what was revealed: the acting head of the kyiv tax authority was allegedly part of a scheme to overlook 45 billion ukrainian hryvnia ($1.2 billion) in unpaid taxes. on wednesday, the state bureau of investigations (sbi) said that it had found hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, as well as luxury watches and cars, at the tax chief’s residence. cnn is attempting to reach that individual for comment.the sbu also accused the “former management” of ukraine’s largest oil extraction and refinery firms of the “misappropriation” of $1.1 billion.the sbu said the ministry of defense’s former head for procurement spent the equivalent of $2.7 million on almost 3,000 bulletproof vests for the ukrainian armed forces which were later found to be unable to “properly protect ukrainian soldiers.” some actions taken so far: top managers at oil firms pjsc ukrtatnafta were served with a notice of suspicion of committing criminal offenses, according to the sbu.it also charged the ministry of defense’s former head for procurement with “misappropriation, embezzlement or seizure of property through abuse of office,” obstruction of the armed forces, and “committing a criminal offense by a group of persons.” the individual faced five to eight years in prison, the sbu said, adding that it had recalled the sub-standard vests. the investigation into january's helicopter crash: former interior minister arsen avakov’s property was searched in connection to an investigation into the jan. 18 helicopter crash that killed 14 people.avakov was interior minister when the ‘super puma’ es-225 helicopter involved in the crash was purchased from france as part of a contract signed in 2018. on wednesday, he denied any wrongdoing and said that the contracts were approved by parliament. as is standard, ukrainian authorities have said they are investigating all possible causes of the helicopter crash, including pilot error, technical malfunction and sabotage. ##catch up## ##corruption searches## britain’s defense minister ben wallace on wednesday said that it's the correct decision ""for now"" not to send fighter jets to ukraine. “what they need right now is armor and tanks,” wallace told reporters when asked why the uk would not send jets, pointing to the uk’s commitment to send challenger 2 tanks to support kyiv’s troops. “i've been involved in this for a pretty long time and i've learned two things: never rule anything in and never rule anything out,” he said. wallace acknowledged this was “not a solid decision,” but added, “for now, i don't think that's the right approach.” “what’s going to move on this conflict this year is going to be the ability for the ukrainians to deploy western armor against russia,” he continued. some background: top ukrainian officials have been jockeying for us-made f-16 fighter jets, arguing they need them urgently to defend against russian missile and drone attacks. the defense minister’s comments come after a downing street spokesperson told journalists tuesday that fighter jets are ""extremely sophisticated and take months to learn how to fly,” adding it was “not practical” to supply them to ukraine. on wednesday, former uk prime minister boris johnson joined kyiv in its calls for the jets to be sent to ukraine during a visit to washington, dc. “all i will say is that every time we have said it will be a mistake to give such and such an item of weaponry, we end up doing it and it ends up being the right thing for ukraine,” johnson told fox news. “save time, save money, save lives. give the ukrainians what they need as fast as possible,” he continued. following johnson’s comments, uk prime minister rishi sunak’s official spokesperson noted johnson was “acting in his own capacity and not on behalf of the uk government,” britain’s pa news agency reported. cnn’s niamh kennedycontributed reporting to this post. italy's upcoming package of military aid to ukraine will probably include weapons of defense against russian missile attacks,a press officer of the italian ministry of defense confirmed to cnn on wednesday. earlier italy's defense minister guido crosetto told the financial timesthat italy was committed to fulfilling ukraine’s requests for weapons to shore up its defenses but declined to offer any specifics. crosetto also said that any decision on air defenses would be taken in conjunction with the french government. the italian government is working on the sixth package of military support to the war-torn country, the press officer told cnn. italy has so far approved five military support packages for ukraine's defense, including both lethal and nonlethal equipment, based on the needs of the ukrainian armed forces. it contributes approximately 390 million euros to the assistance measures provided for by the european peace facility, for a total of 3 billion euros. french defense minister sebastien lecornu announced on tuesday that france will send an additional 12 caesar howitzers to ukraine on top of the 18 howitzers paris has already delivered to kyiv. speaking at a press conference in paris alongside his ukrainian counterpart oleksii reznikov, lecornu said that denmark has also committed to giving their 19 of french-made howitzers to ukraine. the french minister said another priority was the training of ukrainian troops and that 2,000 of them would be trained in france by the summer. correction: this post has been updated to correct the attribution in the first paragraph to a press officer with the italian ministry of defense. a military leader in the self-proclaimed luhansk people’s republic told russian media on wednesday that moscow's forces have practically encircled the key eastern ukrainian city of bakhmut and active fighting is ongoing. “bakhmut has been practically 'embraced' from three sides, an intensive knocking out of the enemy is underway (…),”col. vitaly kiselev said, according to state media tass. russian forces are now trying to move into the area of ​​the ukraine-controlled town of chasov yar about six kilometers (more than 3 miles) west of bakhmut, he added. “they are trying, and i am sure that they will succeed. [it will succeed] to go to the chasov yar area, from where intensive shelling is going on back to soledar, bakhmut,” he said. earlier, retired lt. col. of the self-proclaimed lpr, andrei marochko, said that ukrainian troops were going to withdraw to chasov yar in the event of a retreat from bakhmut. the founder of russia's wagner mercenary group yevgeny prigozhin said in a telegram post on wednesday that russian forces now control the village of sacco and vanzetti, about 20 kilometers (more than 12 miles) from bakhmut in the donetsk region of eastern ukraine. ""today, february 1, 2023, at 16:00 moscow time, sacco and vanzetti were completely taken under control by the assault units of the wagner pmc,"" prigozhin's press service telegram channel said. the press service also posted a photo of the fighters against the background of the only remaining house in the village. prigozhin also noted that at the moment there is no operational encirclement of bakhmut. the deputy defense minister of ukraine hanna maliar has said “heavy fighting” continues in the east with russian forces making “powerful attempts” to break through ukrainian defenses of bakhmut.“the enemy is trying to expand the geography of its offensive in the lyman sector,”a russian offensive north of bakhmut, maliar said on telegram. germany needs to order new leopard tanks quickly after committing to send 14 of its own to ukraine, the country’s defense minister boris pistorius said wednesday. “the decisive factor for me is that we have to order new tanks, and not in a year's time, but quickly so that production can begin and we can plan how many new leopards we will have available — and when,” pistorius told reporters on a visit to the town of augustdorf. “where the money comes from —to put it in casual terms, i honestly don't care. what matters is that we deliver quickly,” pistorius added. chancellor olaf scholz announced the german-made battle tanks would be sent to kyiv’s troops last week, after intensifying international pressure led by the united states, poland and a bloc of other european nations, which called on berlin to step up its military support to ukraine. ukrainian defense minister oleksii reznikov had a ""very frank and productive conversation"" with french president emmanuel macron regarding the ukraine army's ""urgent operational needs for self-defense from the russian aggressor,"" reznikov tweeted wednesday. reznikovthanked macron for his ""leadershipand unwavering support."" on wednesday, reznikov met france minister of the armed forces sebastien lecornu in paris to discuss the needs of the ukrainian army. the pair signed a memorandum on the supply of mg-200 radars for ukrainian air defenders. ""this equipment will help us to spot enemy drones & missiles, including ballistic. our skies will be protected from russia’s deadly attacks,"" reznikov tweeted. on monday, france along with australia said that they would collaborate on a multi-million dollar project to produce “several thousand” artillery shells for ukraine. as for ukraine's plea for fighter jets, macron said monday that they have not received any requests for jets, but “nothing is off-limits in principle.” russian president vladimir putin ordered his defense ministry to prioritize protecting russian territory from shelling by ukrainian forces. speaking at a video conference regarding the restoration of residential infrastructure, putin said residential houses in russia's belgorod, bryansk and kursk regions – as well as crimea, illegally annexed by russia in 2014 – were “damaged or destroyed” by the ukrainian army referring to it as to “shelling by neo-nazi formations.” “of course, the priority task is to eliminate the very possibility of shelling, but this is the business of the military department,” putin said. many people found themselves in a difficult situation, “they lost their homes, were forced to move to relatives or to temporary places of residence, faced interruptions in the supply of water, heat, and electricity,” he added. the armed forces of ukraine have not officially acknowledged the shelling of the russian territory. southwest of the city of bakhmut, ukrainian soldiers andriy and borisych live in a candle-lit bunker cut into the frozen earth. for several weeks they have been confronting hundreds of fighters belonging to the russianprivate military contractor wagnerthrowing themselves againstukrainian defenses. disguised in a balaclava, andriy recounts one seemingly endless firefight when they came under attack by a flood of wagner fighters. “we were fighting for about 10 hours in a row. and it wasn’t like just waves, it was uninterrupted. so it was just like they didn’t stop coming.” their ak-47 rifles became so hot from constant firing, andriy says, that they had to keep changing them. “it was about 20 soldiers on our side. and let’s say 200 from their side,” he says. the wagner way of war is to send a first wave of attackers that mainly comprises raw recruits straight out of russian prisons. they know little of military tactics and are poorly equipped. most just hope that if they survive their six-month contract they can go home rather than back to a cell. “they make the group – let’s say from 10 soldiers – reach 30 meters, then they start digging in to keep the position,” andriy says of wagner. another group follows, he says, to claim another 30 meters. “that’s how, step by step, (wagner) is trying to move forward, while they lose a lot of people in the meantime.” only when the first wave is exhausted or cut down do wagner send in more experienced combatants, often from the flanks, in an effort to overrun ukrainian positions. andriy says facing the assault was a frightening and surreal experience. “our machine gunner was almost getting crazy, because he was shooting at them. and he said, i know i shot him, but he doesn’t fall. and then after some time, when he maybe bleeds out, so he just falls down.” andriy compares the battle to a scene out of a zombie movie. “they’re climbing above the corpse of their friends, stepping on them,” he says. “it looks like it’s very, very likely that they are getting some drugs before attack,” he says, a claim that cnn has not been able independently to verify. read more here. the state bureau of investigations (sbi) claimedthat it had averted a plot to detonate explosives at a power plant in eastern ukraine. “an official of one of the region's law enforcement agencies started collaborating with the enemy,” the sbi said. “he hid explosive devices, ammunition and means of initiating the explosion in a specially equipped cache near thetpp [power plant]in advance, but in the territory controlled by ukraine.” the alleged collaborator, described as a “former security guard,”was served “in absentia a notice of suspicion of high treason and preparation to commit sabotage,” the sbi said. anexplosion at the kurakhove thermal power plant was to be carried out by an accomplice of the accused, the sbi claimed, adding that it was looking for that person. the agencyreleased photosthat it said showed security forces unearthing explosives. cnn has seen no previous reports of an explosives plot at that plant. the sbi claim was made as part of anti-corruption searches and crackdowns across the countryin an effort to combatwhat they described as“the internal enemy"" in the country, according to ukrainian authorities. the security service of ukraine (sbu) said wednesday that it had charged the ministry of defense’s former head for procurement with embezzlement as part ofanti-corruption searches and crackdowns across the country. at issue, it said, was the purchase of thousands of substandard protective vests. “according to the investigation, this official purchased nearly 3,000 bulletproof vests for the armed forces of ukraine for over uah 100 million,” or$2.7 million. “however, according to several independent examinations, these products do not meet the requirements of class iv bulletproof vests and cannot properly protect ukrainian soldiers.” the sbu said that the official was charged with “misappropriation, embezzlement or seizure of property through abuse of office,” obstruction of the armed forces, and “committing a criminal offense by a group of persons.” the sbu said that the individual facedfive to eightyears in prison, and had recalled the sub-standard vests. “in addition, the sbu is conducting investigative actions against other officials in the security and defense sector who may be involved in illegal activities that harm state security. this is a set of measures aimed at strengthening the defense capabilities of our state.” more on the searches: ukrainian authorities on wednesday said they conducted the series of anti-corruption searches and crackdownsin an effort to combatwhat they described as“the internal enemy"" in the country. ##corruption searches## russia is gearing up for a “maximum escalation” of the war in ukraine, potentially as soon as the next few weeks, according to a top ukrainian national security official. “these will be defining months in the war,” oleksiydanilov, secretary of ukraine’s national security and defense council,told sky newsin an interview broadcast tuesday. “i’m conscious the main fights are yet to come and they will happen this year, within two to three months,” he said. “russia is preparing for maximum escalation. it is gathering everything possible, doing drills and training. when it comes to an offensive from different directions, as of now, i can say that we are not excluding any scenario in the next two to three weeks.” ukraine’s defense intelligence believes that the war is “on the edge” of a “very active” period. ""we are on the edge of a very active phase of hostilities, february and march will be very active,” andriy yusov, representative of ukraine’s defense intelligence, said on national television. ukrainian officials have warned for some time of a renewed russian offensive and have asked for more powerful weaponry from western allies to counter the threat. following danilov's comments, a ukrainian military spokesperson said wednesday that there a signs russia is preparing for a renewed offensive in southern ukraine. “not just on land, but on the sea and in air as well,” natalia humeniuk, head of the united coordinating press center of security and defense forces of the south of ukraine, said on national television. ukrainian intelligence had noted changes to the activity of russian naval forces in the black sea, she added. “it increases and decreases rapidly, and the missile carriers are moving back and forth,” she said. meanwhile, the belarusian defense ministry on tuesday said it would hold a further week of joint military drills with russia. ""during the week,military representatives from the two countries will practice joint planning of the use of troops based on the prior experience of armed conflicts in recent years,"" the ministry said in a statement. cnn's denis lapincontributed reporting to this post. ukraine’s president volodymyr zelensky urged the need to increase sanctions against russia on wednesday saying that the “terrorist state must feel the price of terror.” “i stressed the need to increase sanctions against russia and our team stressed that the terrorists state must feel the price of a terror and its capacity to continue aggression should be restricted,” zelensky said in a news conference after meeting with austrian president alexander van der bellen in kyiv. zelensky continued to put pressure on austrian businesses to“step up” their cooperation with ukraine and help to rebuild and modernize the country’s energy systems, telling businesses to leave russia and set up in ukraine. “we know the situation concerning austrian business, which despite the brutal russian terror, are not leaving russia, and continue to support the terrorist state, we believe with their own taxes,” zelensky said. “and therefore, we would like these businesses to go to ukraine instead.” he also urged individual austrian companies not to “betray austrian society,” saying it’s an important issue which will be resolved on the basis of “shared values of freedom, democracy and human rights.” zelensky’s comments come as van der bellenvisited kyiv on wednesday to discuss financial and humanitarian aid for ukraine. israel’s prime minister benjamin netanyahuhassaid he would be willing to serve as mediator between ukraine and russia. in an interview with cnn’s jake tapper on tuesday, netanyahu saidhe was asked tomediate not longafter russia’s invasion of ukraine in februaryoflast year but declined the offer as he was not prime minister at the time. “i was opposition leader at the time and i said, well i have a rule; one prime minister at a time,” he said. when asked if he would agree to it now, netanyahu said: “if asked by all relevant parties, i’ll certainly consider it but i’m not pushing myself.” “i’ve been around long enough to know that there has to be the ripe time and the ripe circumstances. if they arise, i will certainly consider it,"" he told cnn. he added that he would want the united states in particular to ask him as “you can’t have too many cooks in the kitchen, and we have our own backyard to deal with.” netanyahu also stressed during the interview that he had a good relationship with us president joe biden, saying: “i think president biden’s commitment to israel is real, it’s not just words, it’s genuine, it comes from the heart. and my commitment to the alliance with the united states is real.” he said that washington and tel aviv had disagreed on many things, including iran, but the alliance between the two countries “had to be unshakeable.” the austrian president has arrived in kyiv, according to a post on his twitter account. later, van der bellen also posted a photo of himself in the ukrainian town of bucha on twitter, commenting “here in #bucha, i mourn for every single life destroyed by this terrible war of aggression. these crimes against humanity, against everything we stand for, must not be forgotten and must not go unpunished.” he has also met with ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky. as he announced his visit on twitter, he said: “this trip is a gesture for peace, a sign of solidarity with ukrainians.” ukrainian authorities' nationwide anti-corruption searches included the search of former interior minister arsen avakov’s property. it was tied to an investigation into the jan. 18 helicopter crash that killed 14, including the then-interior minister denis monastyrsky, according to avakov. avakov was interior minister when the ‘super puma’ es-225helicopter involved in the crash was purchased from franceas part ofa contract signed in 2018.on wednesday, hedenied any wrongdoing. “the investigating authorities did indeed conduct a search of my place – as part of working out one of the operational versions of the causes of the tragedy in brovary,” avakov said in a statement on telegram. “the investigation was interested in the contracts for the purchase of super puma helicopters (airbus helicopters h225) by the ministry of internal affairs.” he said that the contracts were approved by parliament, and that the helicopters “have saved and will save thousands of lives.” “the investigators behaved correctly, although the expediency of such investigative action looks a little dull, six years after the contract was concluded. naturally, nothing corresponding to the interests of the investigation was found,” he added. as is standard, ukrainian authorities have said they are investigating all possible causes of the helicopter crash, including pilot error, technical malfunction, and sabotage. ##corruption searches##  ukrainian authorities on wednesday conducted a series of anti-corruption searches across the country. one of the initiatives as part of this series was the unsealing of an alleged scheme by the acting head of the kyiv tax authorityto look the other way on 45 billion ukrainian hryvnia ($1.2 billion) in unpaid taxes. the state bureau of investigations (sbi) said that it had found hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, as well as luxury watches and cars, at the residence of the head of the kyiv tax authority. the head of the kyiv tax authority, “along with other members of the commission, made decisions on compliance or non-compliance with the risk criteria of taxpayers without legal grounds, which led to serious consequences,” the sbi said. “the tax officials ‘do not notice’ these schemes, support their existence, or directly participate in them for systematic payment for their ‘services,’” the sbi said in a statement. “as part of the criminal investigation into the abuse of power that caused grave consequences, sbi officers are conducting searches at the suspect's residence and workplace. during the investigation, they have already found 158,000 us dollars, 530,000 ukrainian hryvnia, 2,200 euros, luxury watches, cars, etc.” the sbireleased photosof the cash and luxury goods it said were found at the tax chief’s residence. david arakhamia, the parliamentary majority leader, said that the “entire management of the customs” agency has been dismissed, there have been “searches in the state tax service,” and that authorities have served “notices of suspicion to senior officials of the ministry of defense.” the recent findings from the anti-corruption searches come after presidentvolodymyr zelensky fired a slew ofsenior ukrainian officialsamid a growing corruption scandal linked to the procurement of war-time supplies, in the biggest shakeup of his government sincerussia’s invasionbegan. ##corruption searches## according to

the country’s parliamentary majority leader. david arakhamia announced on telegram that authorities were conducting a “spring raid campaign instead of sowing campaign.” alongside “a whole series of covert investigative actions,” arakhamia said that property searches were conducted of former interior minister arsen avakov, businessman ihor kolomoisky, and politician vadim stolar. he said that the “entire management of the customs” agency has been dismissed, there have been “searches in the state tax service,” and that authorities have served “notices of suspicion to senior officials of the

""we are preparing new reforms in ukraine. reforms that will change the social, legal and political reality in many ways, making it more human, transparent and effective,"" zelensky said in a video address, adding thatfurther details would be announced at a later date. ukraine's prime ministerdenys shmyhal had announced the ""summit"" earlier on tuesday but provided no details on who would attend. shmyhal told politico in an interview published monday that ukraine, which was granted eu candidate status in june last year, has an ""ambitious plan"" to join the bloc within the next two years. ##corruption searches## moscow said on wednesday that there are few signs suggesting that the russia-us dialogue on the nuclear arms control treaty will continue but the agreement is “important” as it is the only one that is still viable. “we consider the continuation of the [start] treaty very important. it is actually the only one that still remains, hypothetically speaking, viable,” kremlin spokesperson dmitry peskov told reporters on a conference call. peskov went on to accuse washington of destroying the basis for the treaty with nato’s military infrastructure “working against” russia which “creates very hostile conditions.” “we see that the united states has actually destroyed the legal basis in the field of arms control and security,” peskov said. “we see how the entire military infrastructure of nato works against the russian federation. we see how the entire nato intelligence infrastructure -- including reconnaissance aircraft and satellite constellations -- works 24/7 in the interests of the ukrainian regime,” he added. “of course, all this creates very hostile conditions for us, which we cannot ignore.” peskov’s comment came after the us state department accused russia of violating its obligations under the new start treaty -- a key nuclear arms control agreement with the united states. the vice-president of the german parliament, or bundestag, has arrived in kyiv, she said on twitter. “kyiv. i arrived here today by night train,” katrin goering-eckardt said. “ukrainians are defending their country & our common freedom. i admire their courage. in the next few days, i would like to get a picture of the reconstruction, the humanitarian situation and the difficult everyday life on the ground.” goering-eckardt's trip comes after germany confirmed last week it will send a long-demanded contingent ofleopard 2tanks to ukraine in a major sign of support for kyiv. the announcement made for a landmark moment that followed weeks ofintense pressureon berlin from some of its nato allies. goering-eckardt expressed her support for the decision, writing on twitter on january 24: ""the #leopard's freed!"" however, on germany's streets, reactions were mixed, with some citizens telling cnn that they were concerned about how the war may now escalate. japanese foreign minister yoshimasa hayashi pledged wednesday to uphold the country's sanctions against russia over its war in ukraine after meeting with nato secretary general jens stoltenberg in tokyo. hayashi told stoltenberg that nato shares ""fundamental values with japan,"" according to a statement from japan's foreign ministry. it is meaningful for japan — which will chair the g7 summit in may and serve as a non-permanent member of the un security council this year — to ""deliver a strong message"" at ""this historical inflection point"" together with nato, he said. hayashi and stoltenberg also exchanged views on the security situation in the indo-pacific region, the statement added. on tuesday, stoltenberg and japanese prime minister fumio kishida said nato and japan would deepen collaboration as the world faces its ""most severe and complex security environment since the end of world war ii,"" according to a statement from the japanese prime minister's office. last week, tokyo approved additional sanctions on moscow, including banning exports to 49 more entities, adding more items to an export ban and freezing assets of individuals tied to the kremlin, public broadcaster nhk reported. ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky said tuesday that his administration is preparing to introduce changes ahead of talks between kyiv and the european union scheduled for friday. ""we are preparing new reforms in ukraine. reforms that will change the social, legal and political reality in many ways, making it more human, transparent and effective,"" zelensky said in a video address, adding thatfurther details would be announced at a later date. kyiv is finalizing preparations for the ""summit"" talks, he added. some context: ukraine's prime ministerdenys shmyhal announced the ""summit"" earlier on tuesday but provided no details on who would attend. holding the meeting in kyiv is a ""powerful signal to both partners and enemies,"" shmyhal said at a government meeting. shmyhal told politico in an interview published monday that ukraine, which was granted eu candidate status in june last year, has an ""ambitious plan"" to join the bloc within the next two years. australia on wednesday announced additional sanctions against iran for supplying drones to russia in its war on ukraine. in a news release, australian foreign minister penny wong said financial sanctions would be imposed on four iranian individuals and four entities involved in the production and supply of drones to moscow. russia has used iranian drones across ukraine with relentless ferocity, targeting both civilian areas and key infrastructure. the sanctions are among wider measures announced wednesday by australia against individuals in iran and myanmar for alleged human rights abuses. “australia stands with the people of myanmar, the people of iran and with the people of ukraine,” the foreign ministry statement read.“we employ every strategy at our disposal towards upholding human rights – ranging from dialogue and diplomacy to sanctions – consistent with our values and our interests.” last month, the united states sanctioned seven iranian officials tied to an iranian defense manufacturer that designs and produces drones which have beenused by russia in the war in ukraine. russia and belarus are conducting a further week of joint military drills, thebelarusian defense ministry said on tuesday, the latest sign of cooperation between the neighboring allies amid moscow's invasion of ukraine. ""during the week,military representatives from the two countries will practice joint planning of the use of troops based on the prior experience of armed conflicts in recent years,"" the ministry said in a statement. the ministry said the aim of the training is to improve the compatibility of the two militaries and is part of preparation for the joint union shield 2023 exercises the two countries will hold in russia in september. the announcement of the new drills comes as russian and belarussian aviation combat units continue to conduct training missions during joint flight and tactical exercises of the air forces of the two countries. the exercises are being held at the ruzhansky training grounds in belarus about 150 kilometers (93 miles) north of the ukrainian border. meanwhile, russian president vladimir putin has backed a plan to set up joint military training centers with belarus, according to agence france-presse. in a decree published tuesday, putin tasked the defense and foreign ministers to conduct talks with belarus and sign an agreement to establish the facilities, afp reported. the document did not specify where they would be based. some context: an announcementby belarus president alexander lukashenko in october that his country and russia would form a joint regional force and carry out exercises set off alarm bells in kyiv. the last time belarus and russia forces held joint exercises,in february last year, many of those russian forces went on to cross the ukrainian border in their ill-fated drive towards the capital. but western officials speaking to media on background this week have expressed doubt that russia could launch an offensive from belarus in the coming months. the russian troops' presence would, however, prompt ukraine into stationing its troops in that direction to ""offset that potential risk,"" the officials said, even though they stressed it is ""hugely unlikely"" that belarus ""will be an axis of advance in the next several months.” top ukrainian officials have in recent days escalated their publiclobbying campaign for us-made f-16 fighter jets, arguing they need them urgently to defend against russian missile and drone attacks. but that push is being met with skepticism by us and allied officials who say the jets would be impractical, both because they require considerable training and because russia has extensive anti-aircraft systems that could easily shoot them down. more puzzling to us officials is why ukraine has made such a public show of asking for f-16s, when in private the jets are rarely mentioned atop ukraine’s wish list of weapons. in private conversations us officials at the pentagon and the white house have had with ukrainians over the last several months, fighter jets have not ranked highly on the country’s list of priorities, officials said. instead, ukraine has been much more focused on long-range missiles — which the us is reluctant to hand over — as well as more ammunition, air defenses and tanks, which are now on their way after a dramatic public debate among nato allies. the europeans have had a similar experience. french president emmanuel macron and dutch prime minister mark rutte said monday that while “nothing is off-limits in principle,” neither the netherlands nor france had received any official requests from ukraine to send the fighter jets. read the full story: russian troops are pummeling the eastern ukrainian town of bakhmut into what the donetsk region military administration head pavlo kyrylenko called a “total ruin.”

are carefully documenting all war crimes. they will be held accountable for everything!,” he wrote on telegram. cnn reported in january that the us and western officials are urging ukraine to shift its focus from the brutal, months-long fight in the bakhmut and prioritize instead a potential offensive in the south, using a different style of fighting that takes advantage of thebillions of dollars in new military hardwarerecently committed by western allies. russia is unlikely to see strategic success in any potential offensive in ukraine this spring due to limited support on force ratios, equipment and logistics, according to western officials speaking to media on background. these limitations might not prevent russia “from trying to launch an offensive,” but their “ability to change the course of the conflict at the moment is constrained,” the officials said. moscow is struggling to replace its losses, the officials added. “there are severe constraints to their ability to really backfill the losses that they have suffered in ukraine, which is why you see them reach out to international partners to try to fill the gap,"" they said. russia and ukraine were fundamentally in ""a race"" as to ""who can maintain the supply of weapons,” they said. moscow's current offensive is more about “the existing manpower and equipment being deployed and redeployed locally. you're seeing people kind of taking offensive action, but i don't think you're seeing the beginning oftheoffensive in big strategic terms. it's unlikely that hundreds of thousands of mobilized reservists have been formed into cohesive formations capable of major offensive, maneuver operations,” the officials explained. belarus' role: meanwhile, the officials expressed doubt in russia using its neighboring ally belarus to launch an offensive in the coming months. “belarus is providing a useful training ground for russian forces where they can outsource for training and then siphon them back round into the front line in ukraine,” the officials said. “we do see russian forces in belarus. we don't see them deployed to the border, and at the moment, they don't have the kind of capability in the logistics to project and threaten kyiv.” but the russian troops' presence would prompt ukraine into stationing its troops in that direction to ""offset that potential risk,"" the officials said, even though they stressed it is ""hugely unlikely"" that belarus ""will be an axis of advance in the next several months.” russia is violating akey nuclear arms control agreementwith the united states and continuing to refuse to allow inspections of its nuclear facilities, a state department spokesperson said tuesday. “russia is not complying with its obligation under the new start treaty to facilitate inspection activities on its territory. russia’s refusal to facilitate inspection activities prevents the united states from exercising important rights under the treaty and threatens the viability of u.s.-russian nuclear arms control,” the spokesperson said in statement.“russia has also failed to comply with the new start treaty obligation to convene a session of the bilateral consultative commission in accordance with the treaty-mandated timeline.” the us announcement is likely to increase tensions with relations between the two countries in the doldrums as moscow continues its war on ukraine. russian president vladimir putin’s nuclear saber rattling during the war has alarmed the us and its allies. in december, putin warned of the“increasing” threatof nuclear war, and this month, dmitry medvedev, deputy head of russia’s security council, threatened that russia losing the war could “provoke the outbreak of a nuclear war.” read more here. russianairborne units have joinedwagnermercenary fightersin the battle for the keyeastern ukrainian city of bakhmut, according to maksym zhorin, a former co-commander of ukraine's azov regiment. zhorinis not fighting on the battlefield but is in contact with ukrainian soldiers and helps with supplies. ""not only the wagnerites are fighting in the bakhmut sector on the russian side,""zhorin said on his official telegram channel tuesday. ""previously, the assaults were carried out first by convicts, followed by more 'elite' wagner units, but now airborne units have also joined the fight,"" he said. zhorin described several differences between the russian forces and wagner troops. ""first of all, this is notable because of the use of their regular equipment. wagner's troops are forced to advance on foot, while russian paratroopers have armored personnel carriers and infantry fighting vehicles, which they actively use,"" zhorin said.""another difference is that for some reason regular troops are less willing to die than wagner's men. that is why they act a little more cautiously. but they are still dying, just not in such huge numbers."" cnn is unable to independently verify those claims. other ukrainian military commanders have echoedzhorin's assessment in recent days, saying thatregular russian military troops are now assistingwagnerprivate military contractors in the fight for bakhmut.",4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.020748705479919034,0.33765725310575334,0.2461691917220033,0.34126246529453114,0,0,0,0,1.3650498611781245,5.665528303660224,17.0,0.3332663708035426
"Opinion: Netanyahu wants peace, but offers few solutions",2023-02-01,15.0,"it was a trajectory -- washington to cairo, and then jerusalem -- similar to the one made nearly a half century earlier by a predecessor of antony blinken. starting in 1974, then-secretary of state henry kissinger's ""shuttle diplomacy"" would bring an accord of sorts and a degree of stability to the region following the catastrophic and bloody yom kippur war between israel and its arab neighbors. but it would bring little real, lasting peace. today, 49 years later, there is still no palestinian state, relations between israelis and their palestinian neighbors are as fraught as ever, blood runs in the streets of both places, and the most obdurate, certainly the most right-wing government in israeli history has just taken power in jerusalem. on tuesday, blinken wound up three days of meetings with egyptian president abdel fatah el-sisi, israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas. and in the end, it seems, all sides seemed quite content to stand on some long-entrenched and hardly softening positions. as blinken was winging his way home, netanyahu told cnn's jake tapper in an exclusive interview on tuesday, ""for 25 years, the palestinians who don't want peace with israel, want to see a peace without israel, who don't want a state next to israel, but a state instead of israel -- they had an effective veto on israel's expansion of the circle of peace around it."" netanyahu insisted that he wants negotiations with the palestinians, which the palestinians don't want. the prime minister also told cnn he believed his priority of cementing amicable arrangements with all arab nations, as the abraham accords provided, would eventually drive the palestinians to the peace table, effectively on his terms. ""if we make peace with saudi arabia, [which] depends on the saudi leadership, and bring effectively the arab-israeli conflict to an end, i think we'll circle back to the palestinians and get a workable peace with the palestinians. i think that's possible,"" netanyahu told tapper. by contrast, abbas emerged from his meeting with blinken and asserted, ""the israeli government is responsible for what's happening these days, because of its practices that undermine the two-state solution and violate the signed agreements, and because of the lack of international efforts to dismantle the occupation and the settlement regimes, and the failure to recognize the palestinian state and its full membership in the united nations."" throughout his visit, and especially at its end, blinken was most careful to treat palestinians and israelis even-handedly, promising america's ""support [for] all efforts to move us closer to peace, expand the horizon of hope, advance equal rights and opportunities for palestinians and israelis."" but he was quite clear on the profound challenges in all three cities he'd visited where ""i heard a deep concern about the current trajectory."" and he was equally clear that america continues to support a two-state solution -- independent states of israelis and palestinians -- a concept that palestinians believe is not shared by the netanyahu government . ""restoring calm is our immediate task, but over the longer term we have to do more than just lower tensions,"" blinken explained. ""it's president biden's firm conviction that the only way to achieve that goal is through preserving and then realizing the vision of two states for two peoples. the united states will continue to oppose anything that puts that goal further from reach, including but not limited to settlement expansion, legalization of illegal outposts, a move towards annexation of the west bank, disruption to the historic status quo on jerusalem's holy sites, demolitions and evictions, and incitement and acquiescence to violence."" quite a heavy lift considering what netanyahu told tapper. indeed, it would seem that the government netanyahu leads is determined to press forward on initiatives only calculated to inflame passions on both sides. his public security minister, itamar ben gvir, has been convicted for inciting anti-arab racism. while aryeh deri, leader of the ultra-orthodox sephardi party shas, was forced to step down as interior minister by the nation's high court, he is expected to return after netanyahu's ruling coalition pledged its support. at the same time, the right-wing dominated knesset awarded to bezalel smotrich -- a religious-zionist leader of the settler movement -- supervision of the jewish territories that palestinians have long claimed for themselves. passions continued to rise, as an israeli army raid on the jenin refugee camp last week left 10 palestinians dead and was followed by an attack by a palestinian gunman on a jerusalem synagogue that left seven dead. in the past week at least 22 people have been killed in violent incidents. amid such a tense atmosphere it seems unlikely that some key middle east nations, particularly saudi arabia, will have any incentive to establish a working relationship with israel that could lead to a lasting peace. at davos, before the latest deadly confrontations between israelis and palestinians, saudi arabia's foreign minister prince faisal bin farhan al saud told the world economic forum, ""palestine remains an important evocative issue in our region... the focus really needs to be on a pathway to resolving this conflict."" netanyahu clearly has staked out consistent priorities that could make any such accommodation unlikely. ""israel should have the overriding security responsibility [for israeli territories] because every time we moved out, say from lebanon, basically iran came in with its proxy hezbollah,"" he told cnn. ""we moved out of gaza and other radical islamists, hamas, took over. and if we just walk away as people suggest, then you'll have hamas and iran move into the hills around jerusalem, overlooking tel aviv."" hardly a recipe for any quick or easy diplomatic breakthrough. but if the overarching purpose of blinken's visit was to engage with the government of netanyahu -- who has had a longstanding, sometimes fraught relationship with president biden -- without burning any new bridges, then the secretary of state may have left in the nick of time. in april, as they often do, ramadan and passover will overlap. a recipe for another round of a conflict that is little closer to resolution. still, as netanyahu pointed out to tapper, and negotiators harking back to kissinger have recognized, deeply flawed though israel may be, it is the only working democracy in the middle east. the us has little alternative, then, to support it and do its best to hold up a mirror to its faults, praying it will do the right thing for all who live within its borders and abroad.

Netanyahu outlines vision for two-state solution -- without Palestinian sovereignty,2023-02-01,16.0,"a shocking 48 hours of violence -- bloody even by the standards of the israeli-palestinian conflict -- followed immediately by a fortunately timed flying visit from us secretary of state antony blinken, focused the eyes of the world on israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu this week. he looked back without blinking. sitting down for an exclusive interview with cnn's jake tapper, he signaled clearly that it is extremely unlikely israel and the palestinians will make any measurable progress toward a long-term peace anytime soon. netanyahu made clear that while he's ""open"" to negotiations with the palestinians and is willing to cooperate with them on security matters, not much else will move. netanyahu has never been a full-throated supporter of a two-state solution, weaving in and out of different definitions of what that would mean. but in recent years he's settled on the idea that he'd be open to a palestinian state - as long as it has no military or security power, an arrangement that would have no parallel among modern sovereign states. ""i'm certainly willing to have them have all the powers that they need to govern themselves, but none of the powers that can threaten us,"" netanyahu told tapper in jerusalem on tuesday. he did provide some new details about his conversations with president biden on the matter, explaining he once told biden, ""[a]ny final agreement between israel and the palestinians would have israel controlling security -- overriding security responsibility in the area west of the jordan. ""i said, you can't divide who controls the airspace [between the jordan river and the mediterranean]. you have to cross it. it takes two minutes for an airplane to cross it. so what, one minute israel controls it and the other minute the palestinians? of course, it's not workable. ""he said to me, as others have said to me -- 'you know, but that's not perfect sovereignty.' ""and i said, you're right. but -- i don't know what you'd call it, but it gives them the opportunity to control their lives, to elect their officials, to run their economy, to run their institutions, to have their flag and to have their parliament, but we have to have overriding security control."" most palestinians would view that arrangement as a continuation of the current occupation -- and an unacceptable starting point for peace negotiations. collective punishment tapper pressed netanyahu over accusations that israel is engaging in collective punishment of palestinians in the wake of two shooting attacks targeting israelis around jerusalem that killed seven and wounded five. measures announced by the israeli cabinet in response included issuing more gun permits for civilians, increasing security for jewish settlements in the west bank and pushing draft legislation that would possibly revoke the israeli residency of families of those accused of engaging in or supporting terrorism. netanyahu claimed he doesn't ""believe in collective punishment,"" although most human rights organizations call actions targeting the families of attackers exactly that. ""it's not targeting family members. it's targeting family members who were involved in the terror acts or supported it after the act was done ... i think that disincentivizes the terrorists,"" netanyahu said. the legislation to revoke residency of families of attackers will likely face legal challenges, something israeli human rights organization hamoked has already vowed to do. arab peace before palestinian peace netanyahu made clear to tapper: his priority is normalization with arab nations before peace with the palestinians. after the success of the abraham accords, netanyahu told tapper he wants to expand the countries in what he calls the ""circle of peace,"" with his top objective being saudi arabia. for years, peace with the palestinians was seen as a precondition for any normalization agreements between arab countries and israel. but netanyahu argued the abraham accords changed the game. ""i think that the way we're going to succeed is not let the palestinian tail wag the body of the arab world,"" he said. ""if we make peace with saudi arabia -- it depends on the saudi leadership -- and bring, effectively, the arab-israeli conflict to an end, i think we will circle back to the palestinians and get a workable peace with the palestinians,"" netanyahu said. but with rising and concerning levels of violence from all sides, a far-right israeli government in place under netanyahu, and a palestinian authority led by an increasingly unpopular president mahmoud abbas, that may be an overly optimistic game plan. the digest us cautions israel on policies, urges palestinians to improve governance and accountability blinken on tuesday called for israelis and palestinians to de-escalate, stop violence and reduce tensions after a meeting with abbas in the west bank. he cautioned against israeli moves including ""things like settlement expansion, the legalization of [israeli settler] outposts, demolitions and evictions [of palestinians from their homes], disruptions to the historic status of the holy sites and of course incitement and acquiescence to violence."" background: blinken's visit comes after palestinians and israelis suffered significant bloodshed last week. thursday was the deadliest day for palestinians in the occupied west bank in nearly two years, followed by a shooting near a jerusalem synagogue friday night, which israel has deemed one of its worst terror attacks in recent years. why it matters: fears had been growing that the situation in israel and the west bank could spiral out of control and blinken's visit was expected to calm tensions. blinken asked senior state department officials to remain in the middle east to help assist with steps that both israel and the palestinians have suggested to him ""to lower the temperature."" abu dhabi's ihc to invest $381 million in adani enterprises following damaging short seller report abu dhabi's international holding company (ihc) on monday announced that it would invest 1.4 billion dirhams ($381 million) in india's adani enterprises' follow-on public offering . the investment comes after the indian conglomerate's market value plummeted around $70 billion following a damaging short seller report. background: this is ihc's first investment of the year, and second investment deal with adani group after last year's 7.3 billion dirhams ($2 billion) investment in the group's companies. one of india's largest multinational conglomerates, adani and its owner gautam adani -- one of asia's richest men -- were caught in the crosshairs of a research firm that accused the conglomerate and adani himself of pulling off ""the largest con in corporate history."" the report and the selloff it sparked erased some $70 billion in market value across adani group companies. adani said it complied with all local laws and had made the necessary regulatory disclosures. why it matters: the investment deal comes as ihc aims to increase its global acquisitions by 70% in 2023. abu dhabi's largest listed company, ihc's market value more than doubled last year. it is chaired by sheikh tahnoun bin zayed al nahyan, the influential uae national security adviser and a brother of the uae's president. iran, russia link banking systems amid western sanction iran and russia have connected their interbank communication and transfer systems to help boost trade and financial transactions, reuters cited a senior iranian official as saying on monday, as both tehran and moscow are chafing under western sanctions. iran's central bank chief mohammad farzin welcomed the move. ""the financial channel between iran and the world is being repaired,"" he tweeted. background: since the 2018 reimposition of us sanctions on iran after washington ditched tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, the islamic republic has been disconnected from the belgium-based swift financial messaging service, which is a key international banking access point. similar limitations have been slapped on some russian banks since moscow's invasion of ukraine last year. why it matters: since the start of the ukraine war, tehran and moscow have acted to forge close bilateral ties as both capitals attempt to build new economic and diplomatic partnerships elsewhere. with deepening economic misery, many iranians are feeling the pain of galloping inflation and rising joblessness. iran's supreme leader ali khamenei said on monday that the establishment faced ""a tangible welfare and livelihood problem"" that could not be cured without economic growth. 11.4% the turnout in tunisia's parliamentary runoff elections on sunday, reuters cited the country's electoral commission as saying. president kais saied on monday blamed the low turnout on hatred among voters of the parliament, calling it ""an institution of absurdity and a state within the state."" his critics said the turnout was evidence of public disdain for his agenda and seizure of powers, and opposition parties called for his resignation. around the region passengers were left disappointed last weekend after spending more than 13 hours in the air on a flight that never landed at its intended destination. emirates airline had to return to dubai on its way to auckland, new zealand, on friday when the destination city's airport closed due to flooding. the airbus a380 superjumbo turned back upon reaching west of indonesia, more than a third of the way to auckland, a map from flight tracking site flightradar24 showed. new zealand's biggest city has been inundated with record rain. an estimated 240 millimeters of rainfall (9.8 inches) -- equal to an entire summer's worth of rain -- fell on auckland friday, making it the city's wettest day on record. the rain caused widespread travel disruption over the weekend. more than 2,000 people stayed overnight friday in the airport's terminals due to the flooding, the airport said. domestic flights resumed saturday but the international terminal was not operational until sunday. emirates resumed the auckland route, its longest at 14,200 kilometers (8,800 miles), in december after an almost three-year hiatus due to the covid-19 pandemic. the flight takes between 16 and 17 hours and is among the world's longest nonstop commercial routes. photo of the day ",12.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.33976957279567915,0.3480011109883587,0.3122293217844951,0.11008777104422351,0,0,0,0,1.3210532525306822,4.661376264740223,30.0,0.1553792088246741
"'It's all empty promises': Palestinians feel betrayed by US, warn there's only so much they can bear",2023-02-01,17.0,"abu a'asem brews pot after pot of his specialty arabic coffee, despite the pouring rain. his corner stand at the heart of ramallah is always busy, no matter the weather, but his future as a palestinian is very much as gloomy as the skies above. ""i am 40 years old and i keep seeing the same thing. many leaderships have come and gone and the situation remains the same,"" he says. despite us secretary of state antony blinken meeting with palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas just a few hilly kilometers away on tuesday, a'asem says he is sure palestinians are not a priority for washington. ""his visit is only intended for israel,"" he says. ""it's just good manners to pass by since he is in the neighborhood."" blinken's visit came in a month that has seen the number of palestinians killed by israeli security forces at an eight-year-high. ten of those deaths occurred because of a raid by israeli forces in jenin on thursday. tensions quickly spiraled and the next day, a palestinian man shot and killed seven israelis outside a synagogue. friday night's shooting attack took place in the israeli settlement of neve yaakov, an area israel considers to be a neighborhood of jerusalem, but which is deemed illegally occupied land by most of the international community. blinken sought to lower the temperature, even before he arrived in israel, while reinforcing the us ironclad commitment to israeli security. he also said the us, specifically the biden administration, remains committed to a two-state solution. speaking alongside abbas in ramallah, blinken said it was necessary first ""to take steps to de-escalate, to stop the violence, to reduce tensions, and to try as well to create the foundation for more positive actions going forward."" but that, he said, was ""not sufficient"" by itself. ""it's also important to continue to strive not only for reducing violence but ensuring that ultimately israelis and palestinians alike enjoy the same rights, the same opportunities. what we're seeing now from palestinians is a shrinking horizon of hope, not an expanding one, and that, too, we believe needs to change."" yet a'asem is not putting his faith in the united states' top diplomat. ""he might offer us something here and there but it's all empty promises,"" he says. ""since day one of the occupation it's the same promises and same things and they are failure and empty promises."" down the road, the smell of cashews and almonds being roasted at rifa'at yousuf's shop cuts through the cold winter air. he too is not optimistic. ""it's gone from bad to worse,"" yousuf, 44, says of us policy towards palestinians. ""(blinken's) visit is not welcome for us palestinians,"" he adds, accusing the secretary of state of enabling israeli occupation and supporting what he says are israel's violent actions in the occupied west bank. ""we, as palestinian people, we are against any visit from anyone who supports israel in this way."" israeli prime minister benajmin netanyahu vowed this week that israel would ""strengthen"" settlements in response to the shooting attacks in jerusalem, a position blinken cautioned against on tuesday. but speaking with cnn's jake tapper on tuesday, netanyahu said people can get ""hung up"" on peace negotiations with the palestinians, saying he has opted for a different approach. ""when effectively the arab-israeli conflict (comes) to an end, i think we'll circle back to the palestinians and get a workable peace with the palestinians,"" he said. asked what concessions israel would grant palestinian territories, netanyahu responded: ""well, i'm certainly willing to have them have all the powers that they need to govern themselves. but none of the powers that could threaten (us) and this means that israel should have the overriding security responsibility."" the disillusionment, hopelessness and the feeling of abandonment is difficult to swallow for most in ramallah, but it's especially tough for the palestinian youth, who see no future for their people or themselves. ""we are very upset,"" 18-year-old nihad omar says. ""every day we see someone become a martyr or a prisoner, it's the same cycle and the numbers just keep increasing, they are not going down."" analysts on both sides say the israeli government's promises that it will respond to violence with an ""iron fist,"" coupled with the despair felt by many in gaza and the west bank, have turned the region into a powder keg with an ever-shortening fuse. echoing that feeling, omar says there's only so much pressure palestinians can and are willing to bear. ""the occupation is surrounding us from all over and not letting the palestinian people breathe,"" he says. hanan ashwari, a palestinian rights advocate and former member of the executive committee of the palestine liberation organization, says the frustration with the united states and israel felt by those cnn spoke with is valid, and very much widespread through ramallah and the west bank. ""(blinken) wants to integrate israel in the region, which means, you know, sideline the palestinians, reward israel and normalize the occupation,"" ashwari says. ""then they talk about being in favor of two-state solution, they pat themselves on the shoulder and they go home. ""that's very ironic, because they stood aside and they allowed israel to destroy the two-state solution by destroying the palestinian state, stealing land, killing people, demolishing homes, and terrorizing, through settlers and the army, the palestinians,"" she adds. the disillusionment, ashwari says, is not just with the united states, but also with the current palestinian leadership. ""we have had a leadership that is not just rhetoric but has held on to positions of power and has failed in many ways to deliver to the people even its own policies,"" she explains. ""i think it is time to have elections and to have a new leadership chosen by the people enjoying the legitimacy of the election."" most we spoke with in ramallah agree. ""the palestinian leadership tries to appease the palestinian people and bring good, but they are handicapped and incapable of delivering,"" omar says. ""the people who are around [current palestinian authority president] mahmoud abbas are unfortunately more cooperative with the israelis than him,"" yousuf says. ""i wish we had someone with the spirit yasser arafat had."" but some do still give abbas and his leadership some credit. ""the palestinian leadership tries to bring solutions for the palestinian people, but they face many challenges,"" coffee-stand owner a'asem says. those challenges to a more prosperous palestinian future, including the establishment of a palestinian state, they say are roadblocks purposefully put in place by israeli politicians. for ashwari, israeli policies towards palestinians, now enacted by what is the most right-wing government in the country's history, are slowly but surely destroying the viability of a two-state solution. ""israel is making sure there is no viable sovereign palestinian state by expanding settlements, stealing more land,"" ashwari says. ""this is unacceptable. the more settlements you build, the less land you have for the palestinians."" on the streets of ramallah, palestinians are acutely aware of that reality. ""we hope for a two-state solution but what we see on the horizon and what we see on the ground there is nothing to indicate a two-state solution [is viable],"" yousuf says. ""palestinians don't have power or opinion or choice, the two-state solution is only words, we aspire for a two-state solution, but this is becoming a dream, an unrealistic dream."" ""there won't be a two-state solution,"" omar agrees. ""with the israeli occupiers never."" as he brews another pot of coffee, a pensive a'asem realises the dream of a palestinian state doesn't seem to be getting any closer. ""maybe the two state (solution) has become an unrealistic dream,"" he concedes, seemingly heartbroken by the acknowledgment. but that sense of defeat is only a momentary lapse before a fiery comeback. ""we palestinians, we are an emotional people, we are generous, and we will be generous to the jewish people when they come as guests,"" he says. ""but with an occupier there will never be peace.""

Exclusive: Netanyahu says don't get 'hung up' on peace with Palestinians first,2023-01-31,18.0,"israel's prime minister benjamin netanyahu said people can get ""hung up"" on peace negotiations with the palestinians, saying he has opted for a different approach in an interview with cnn's jake tapper on tuesday. ""when effectively the arab-israeli conflict (comes) to an end, i think we'll circle back to the palestinians and get a workable peace with the palestinians,"" he said. asked by tapper about the biden administration's concerns that settlements in the occupied west bank could exacerbate tensions, netanyahu pointed to the success of the trump-era abraham accords that normalized relations between israel and several arab countries. ""i went around them (palestinians), i went directly to the arab states and forged with a new concept of peace... i forged four historic peace agreements, the abraham accords, which is twice the number of peace agreements that all my predecessors in 70 years got combined."" his comments come at a tense moment for israel. palestinians and israelis have suffered terrible bloodshed in the past week, and fears are growing that the situation will spiral out of control. last thursday was the deadliest day for palestinians in the occupied west bank in nearly two years, followed by a shooting near a jerusalem synagogue friday night -- which israel has deemed one of its worst terror attacks in recent years. the biden administration has advocated for a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict, but there has been very little movement and seemingly few active efforts toward that goal by netanyahu or palestinian leaders. analysts say the abraham accords have also done little to moderate israel's position on the palestinians. when asked what concession israel would grant palestinian territories, netanyahu responded: ""well, i'm certainly willing to have them have all the powers that they need to govern themselves. but none of the powers that could threaten (us) and this means that israel should have the overriding security responsibility."" there are hopes that us secretary of state antony blinken's trip to israel and the west bank this week would help cool rising tensions. but both administrations appear to be on opposite sides of the coin when it comes to israeli settlements. netanyahu vowed this week that israel would ""strengthen"" settlements in response to shooting attacks in jerusalem, a position blinken cautioned against on tuesday. when asked about us concerns that expanding israeli settlements on palestinian land could hamper peace prospects, netanyahu said: ""well, i totally disagree."" complicated relations biden and netanyahu have a complicated relationship, especially over iran. netanyahu clashed with former us president barack obama over negotiations with the palestinians, then again more openly over the iran nuclear deal -- which biden would like to re-enter. netanyahu explained his position on iran to tapper, saying, ""if you have rogue regimes that are (intending to get) nuclear weapons, you can sign 100 agreements with them, it doesn't help."" ""i think the only way that you can stop or abstain from getting nuclear weapons is a combination of crippling economic sanctions, but the most important thing, is a credible military threat,"" he said. iran has said its nuclear program is only for peaceful purposes and that it formally halted its weapons program, but us officials warned iran's uranium enrichment activities have gone far beyond the parameters of the failed 2015 nuclear deal since former us president trump exited it. last week, the international atomic energy agency chief warned that tehran has amassed enough material for ""several nuclear weapons"" and urged diplomatic efforts to restart to prevent such a scenario. another point of contention among us allies has been israel's ambivalent stance on ukraine. since russia's invasion of ukraine, israel has been performing a diplomatic balancing act in relations with moscow. although it has officially condemned the invasion and regularly sends aid to ukraine, israel has yet to send the ukrainians weapons, and has been criticized for not being more forceful in its criticism of russia. israel does not want to upset russia when the israeli air force is looking to hit targets across the border in syria. israel has launched hundreds of strikes against its neighbor in recent years, mostly aimed at disrupting iran's supply of precision-guided missile technology to hezbollah. netanyahu referenced this complicated scenario to tapper, adding that israel has been ""taking action against certain weapons development"" in iran. he however refused to confirm or deny whether israel was behind drone attacks at a military plant in iran's central city of isfahan over the weekend. ""i never talk about specific operations... and every time some explosion takes place in the middle east, israel is blamed or given responsibility -- sometimes we are sometimes we're not."" most right-wing cabinet the wide-ranging interview touched on concerns about netanyahu's cabinet, described as the most far right and religious in the country's history, which has already faced internal tensions and widespread public protests. netanyahu's governing coalition relies on the support of a number of nationalist political figures once consigned to the fringes of israeli politics. netanyahu dismissed concerns about the inflammatory rhetoric and actions of these members, saying: ""i've got my two hands on the wheel."" pressed on some of those extreme statements -- including reports that finance minister bezalel smotrich described himself as a ""fascist homophobe"" -- netanyahu said: ""well, a lot of people say a lot of things when they're not in power. they sort of temper themselves when they get into power. and that's certainly the case here."" netanyahu accused critics of hypocrisy and not holding a similar lens against his predecessors, while adding: ""look, i'm controlling the government, and i'm responsible for its policies, and the policies are sensible, and responsible, and continue to be that."" the six-time prime minister also rejected criticism of his government's push for judicial reforms, that would give parliament (and by extension the parties in power) the ability to overturn supreme court rulings, appoint judges, and remove from ministries legal advisers whose legal advice is binding. this comes after he was forced to dismiss key ally aryeh deri from his ministerial posts after the high court ruled that it was unreasonable to appoint the shas party leader to positions in government due to his criminal convictions. netanyahu told tapper that he believed the changes would ""make democracy stronger."" his country has seen ongoing demonstrations against judicial reforms, drawing tens of thousands of israelis to the streets in january. meanwhile, netanyahu continues to face charges on three separate cases in a long-running corruption trial that has dogged him politically. he has repeatedly denied all the charges against him, and has described the trial as a ""witch hunt."" when asked whether there was an truth to claims that netanyahu was trying to override the judiciary due to his own interests, he said ""that's false. none of the reforms that we're talking about... have anything to do with my trial.""

"Blinken visit reaches new urgency as Israeli, Palestinian tensions boil",2023-01-30,19.0,"us secretary of state antony blinken's trip to israel and the west bank may have been in the works for weeks, but it couldn't come at a more pressing time. both palestinians and israelis have suffered terrible bloodshed in the last few days, and fears are growing that the situation will spiral out of control. thursday was the deadliest day for palestinians in the occupied west bank in nearly two years, followed by a shooting near a jerusalem synagogue friday night, which israel has deemed one of its worst terror attacks in recent years. even before the latest flare-up, the trip was expected to be prickly, as blinken's first visit to israel since the installation of prime minister benjamin netanyahu's government -- widely considered the most far-right and religious in israeli history. now hope hinges on the arrival of the us top diplomat on monday to help cool the rising temperatures on the ground. security coordination crisis aside from trying to calm the situation through dialogue, one of blinken's main priorities will likely be to try to restore crucially important security coordination between israel and the palestinian authority (pa). the pa announced it was severing the coordination on thursday, following a deadly israeli military raid in the west bank which killed 10 people, among them militants and at least one civilian woman, according to both israeli and palestinian officials. the us immediately said ending security cooperation was not ""the right step to take at this moment."" the coordination is seen by many israeli and american officials as a vital part of maintaining some level of calm, as it involves sharing of intelligence on militant activity, and also links between israeli and palestinian security forces. without that coordination, israel may not be able to tell palestinian security forces where and when they will be operating in the west bank, which could lead to dangerous mistakes or clashes between the two. but the pa has been under pressure for months to cut off the coordination, often seen by palestinians as forcing them to do israel's bidding on occupied territory. it has taken such steps in the past, in 2020 severing coordination for six months when israel announced ultimately unfulfilled plans to annex parts of the west bank, and in 2017 briefly after israeli police placed metal detectors at the entrances to the haram al-sharif or noble sanctuary, known to jews as temple mount, in jerusalem. ""this security coordination is both humiliating and ineffective,"" nour odeh, a former spokeswoman for the pa, told cnn. ""the pa right now is losing, not just losing control, but losing face. it has no money to pay salaries. it has no control, no ability to protect its citizens, and yet it is expected from the world to protect the occupier and coordinate with them."" retired israeli col. michael milshtein, former head of the department for palestinian affairs in israel defense intelligence, said he hopes blinken will ""leverage or pressure the pa to renew the security coordination,"" adding that it would be even better if the ""egyptians and the jordanians put their pressure on (pa president mahmoud) abbas."" milshtein said resuming security coordination would not only ""reduce the general tension,"" but send a signal to palestinian militant groups that rival the pa. ""it's also going to signal to other organizations, players like (militant groups) hamas and islamic jihad, that there is no vacuum that they can get in and use it to promote their terror attacks. and that the old rules of the game are preserved,"" he said. but odeh said pushing the palestinians back toward coordination ""won't be an easy sell, because that will mean a loss... in the eyes of palestinians."" pressure on netanyahu blinken's first stop is in israel, where he will meet with netanyahu and other top israeli officials. it's during these meetings, both milshtein and odeh said, that blinken should put the pressure on netanyahu to resist the more extremist wings of his cabinet, some of whom have called for the dismantling of the pa, while others have called for the death penalty for those israel accuses of terrorism. the israeli government, in response to two shooting attacks in jerusalem that killed seven civilians and injured five, rolled out a series of measures including plans to demolish the homes of the attackers and drafting legislation to revoke israeli identity cards and residency of families of those israel has accused of terrorism, practices critics say are forms of collective punishment proscribed by international law. ""i know how complex is the current government, it's not easy to promote strategy or promote even negotiations with the palestinians. but in the end of the day, (netanyahu) should understand that we're standing between bad and worse alternatives,"" milshtein said. blinken should also demand israel changes its policies toward the pa, milshtein said, especially moves that negatively impact the economic health of the territories. ""i think that right now the pa is in a very fragile and very weak status, every punishment or economic punishment, will actually undermine and damage more the stability of the pa,"" milshtein said. ""although the pa causes a lot of problems to israel... we have much more profits from the existence of the pa than from its vanishing."" odeh said blinken needs to show netanyahu that israeli military operations in the west bank, which have increased over the past year in response to a series of attacks targeting israelis, are only making things worse. last year was the deadliest year for palestinians in the occupied west bank, and for israelis, in nearly two decades. ""they can tell this government that this modus operandi doesn't work. you can't keep pushing palestinians like that. you can't have more than 30 palestinians killed in less than a month [as has happened in january]. you can't demolish homes -- that will expel families -- and [impose] collective punishment measures,"" odeh said. ""it won't be long before palestinians say, 'you know what, we have to also organize and defend ourselves ... nobody's there to help us. so we're going to do it ourselves.' when you get there, nobody can put a lid on that,"" odeh said. hopes are not high that blinken's visit will dampen the smoldering embers in israel and the palestinian territories, especially as the ramadan and passover holidays approach, traditionally a period that has led to clashes in jerusalem. ""right now, the temperature, the atmosphere on the ground is very high. so you need only one spark to really bring a broad explosion,"" milshtein said. nic robertson and vasco cotovio contributed to this report. the digest iran summons ukraine diplomat over comments on drone strike iran summoned ukraine's charge d'affaires in tehran on monday over his country's comments on a drone strike on a military factory in the central iranian province of isfahan, according to state-backed press tv. an adviser to ukranian president volodymyr zelenskiy linked the incident directly to the war in ukraine. ""explosive night in iran,"" mykhailo podolyak tweeted on sunday. ""did warn you."" background: iran's ministry of defense said that the saturday attack took place using ""small drones against a defense ministry industrial complex,"" adding that there were no casualties and only ""minor damage was sustained to the roof of the complex."" russia on monday condemned the strike and warned against ""provocative"" actions that could trigger an escalation in an already tense situation. oil prices climbed on monday. why it matters: ukraine accuses iran of supplying hundreds of drones to russia which are used to attack civilian targets in its cities. iran has acknowledged sending drones to russia but says they were sent before moscow's invasion of ukraine last year. moscow denies its forces use iranian drones in ukraine, although many have been shot down and recovered there. us media outlets reported that us officials believe the attacks were carried out by israel. cnn has not independently confirmed that information. qatar replaces russia in three-way consortium exploring lebanon's offshore energy blocks oil companies totalenergies and eni said monday that they have transferred a 30% interest to qatarenergy in two exploration blocks off the coast of lebanon, reuters reported, citing totalenergies chairman and ceo patrick pouyanné. the three-way consortium deal is meant to provide totalenergies and eni with a 35% interest each, with qatarenergy holding the remaining 30% stake, which until last september belonged to russia. background: lebanon first signed a consortium with totalenergies, eni and russia's novatek to begin exploration in 2017. but in september, russia pulled out of the deal, leaving its share to the lebanese government. a month later, lebanon -- which for years bickered with neighboring israel over a long-disputed maritime border -- finally signed a us-brokered deal with israel to demarcate the area in the mediterranean sea that is believed to be rich in oil and gas. why it matters: lebanon hopes that discoveries in the potentially energy-rich blocks would help its shattered economy as well as incentivize future investors to participate. top us treasury official to discuss russian sanction evasion on trip to oman, uae and turkey under secretary of the treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence brian e. nelson is traveling to oman, the uae and turkey this week, where he plans to discuss russia's attempts to evade international sanctions amid the ukraine war, according to a us treasury statement on saturday. background: the us has been concerned about russia's attempts to evade sanctions imposed by the us and its international partners since the start of the ukraine war in february 2022. two main hubs hosting russian businessmen have been turkey and the uae. last year, international financial crime watchdog the financial action task force (fatf) placed the uae on a ""grey"" money-laundering watch list in an effort to subject its finances to increased monitoring. why it matters: nelson's trip comes amid strained ties between turkey and nato over turkish president recep tayyip erdogan's close ties with moscow. it also comes as the uae and other gulf arab states expand international partnerships beyond the us. what's trending saudi arabia: #i_hate_the_niqab a hashtag decrying the islamic face veil, or niqab, was trending in saudi arabia on monday, leading to a flood of tweets in defense of the covering. while ""i hate the niqab"" was trending, few posts were seen supporting the hashtag, with most instead defending the veil. many, particularly men, called for women to respect islamic customs. others saw it as an attack on their faith and called for women to keep away from feminist ideas.

"At least seven dead in Jerusalem synagogue attack, Israeli police say",2023-01-27,23.0,"israeli police say at least seven people were killed and three were injured in a shooting near a synagogue in jerusalem on friday amid high tensions in israel and the palestinian territories. two people were wounded in a separate shooting attack on saturday in the city of david area of jerusalem, according to police and ambulance services. the victims, one in his 20s and another in his 40s or 50s, were taken to the trauma unit of the shaare zedek medical center, the hospital said. in a statement the police said, ""the shooting suspect was neutralized"" after a ""large police force was called to the scene."" the incident is being treated as a suspected terror attack, according to a preliminary report issued by jerusalem police. friday's shooter was also later killed by police forces, according to police, in what police chief yaakov shabtai described as ""one of the worst terror attacks in the past few years."" ""as a result of the shooting attack, the death of 7 civilians was determined and 3 others were injured with additional degrees of injury,"" police said. five of the shooting victims were pronounced dead at the scene, israel's magen david adom (mda) emergency rescue service said: four men and a woman. five people were transported to hospitals, where another man and woman were declared dead. among the wounded is a 15-year-old boy, the mda said. the attack occurred around 8:15 p.m. local time, near a synagogue on neve yaakov street, according to a police statement. shabtai said the gunman ""started shooting at anyone that was in his way. he got in his car and started a killing spree with a pistol at short range."" he then fled the scene in a vehicle and was killed after a shootout with police forces, police said. police identified the gunman as a 21-year-old resident of east jerusalem, saying in a statement that he appeared to have acted alone. east jerusalem is a predominantly palestinian area of the city, which was captured by israel in 1967. israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu urged people against revenge attacks on friday night. ""i call on the people not to take the law into their own hands. for that purpose we have an army, police and security forces. they act and will act according to the cabinet instructions,"" he said. the incident comes one day after the deadliest day for palestinians in the west bank in over a year, according to cnn records. on thursday, israeli forces killed nine palestinians and wounded several others in the west bank city of jenin, according to the palestinian ministry of health, prompting the palestinian authority to suspend security coordination with israel. a tenth palestinian was killed that day in what israel police called a ""violent disturbance"" near jerusalem. overnight, on friday morning local time, israel launched air strikes on the gaza strip after rockets were fired towards israel. israel's controversial national security minister itamar ben gvir visited the scene of the attack on friday evening, telling people who were chanting angrily that ""it cannot continue like this."" ""i can tell you, [the people chanting] you are right. the burden is on us. it cannot continue like this,"" ben gvir, who also leads the far-right jewish power party, said. some people on the scene were chanting support for ben gvir, saying ""you are our voice, we support you."" cnn's hadas gold and team, who were also at the scene of friday night's shooting, heard what sounded like celebratory gunfire and car horns honking from the nearby predominantly palestinian neighborhood of beit hanina. the white house condemned the ""heinous terror attack"" at a synagogue in jerusalem on friday and said the united states government has extended its ""full support"" to israel, white house press secretary karine jean-pierre said in a statement. the us state department also condemned the ""apparent terrorist attack"" in jerusalem ""in the strongest terms."" ""this is absolutely horrific,"" said state department deputy spokesperson vedant patel. ""our thoughts, prayers and condolences go out to those killed and injured in this heinous act of violence."" patel said no change to the schedule of secretary of state antony blinken's upcoming trip to egypt, israel and the west bank was expected. the european union, france and the uk also condemned the shooting. ""i am appalled by reports of the terrible attack in neve yaakov tonight. attacking worshippers at a synagogue on erev shabat is a particularly horrific act of terrorism. the uk stands with israel,"" neil wigan, the british ambassador in israel wrote on twitter. the eu ambassador to israel, dimiter tzantchev, also condemned the ""senseless violence,"" saying in his tweet, ""terror is never the answer."" and the french embassy in israel tweeted that the incident was ""all the more despicable as it was committed on this day of international remembrance of the holocaust."" united nations secretary general antonio guterres also condemned friday's deadly attack, his spokesman said. ""it is particularly abhorrent that the attack occurred at a place of worship, and on the very day we commemorated international holocaust remembrance day,"" he said. guterres also expressed worry ""about the current escalation of violence in israel and the occupied palestinian territory,"" urging all ""to exercise utmost restraint.""",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.05428640137231627,0.38759656770284784,0.24416355788707733,0.5165690174685492,0,0,0,0,0.5165690174685492,0.7021942293369844,11.0,0.06383583903063494
Blinken to visit Israel and West Bank with tensions high after outbreak of violence,2023-01-27,24.0,"us secretary of state antony blinken's trip to jerusalem and ramallah next week has gained new urgency after a wave of deadly violence in israel and the west bank. his trip, which also includes a stop in egypt, was already expected to be complicated, as it will be the top us diplomat's first visit to israel since the new israeli government, which includes ultra-nationalists and ultra-religious parties, took power. now, blinken is poised to face a rapidly escalating crisis that shows no signs of de-escalation. at least seven people were killed in a mass shooting at a synagogue in jerusalem friday that is being described as a terrorist attack. israeli police said the gunman, who was killed by police, was a 21-year-old resident of east jerusalem who appeared to have acted alone. on thursday, israeli forces killed nine palestinians and wounded several others in a raid on a refugee camp in the west bank city of jenin. another palestinian man was shot dead by israeli troops later that day in the town of al-ram, adding to the death toll on what was the deadliest day for palestinians in the west bank in over a year, according to cnn records. then overnight on friday israel launched air strikes on gaza after rockets were fired towards israel. the palestinian authority responded to the jenin raid by announcing that it will cease security coordination with israel starting immediately. while us officials have indicated that the days of violence will not upend the top diplomat's trip, the white house on friday condemned the ""heinous terror attack"" on the synagogue and state department officials on thursday expressed concern about the security situation following the jenin raid. ""there is the potential for things to worsen in security terms, in terms of protests or any other kind of kinetic action,"" barbara leaf, the top state department official for the region, told reporters on thursday ahead of the synagogue shooting, adding that the department is in close touch with diplomatic and security personnel on the ground. she also urged the two sides to retain and deepen security coordination. the biden administration has been careful in its language and sought to publicly avoid criticizing the new government in israel, which is led by prime minister benjamin netanyahu and includes controversial far-right government ministers. over the past few weeks, us officials have held numerous engagements with the new government -- blinken's trip follows visits by national security adviser jake sullivan and cia director bill burns. israel is one of the us's staunchest allies and the importance of the relationship was underlined earlier this week as the two nations launched their largest joint military exercise ever on monday. aaron david miller, who served for two decades at the state department as an analyst, negotiator and adviser on middle east issues, told cnn that he has ""never seen an administration engage with a new israeli government as frequently and as early and at as senior level as this one."" ""i think their strategy was basically to say, 'ok, you formed this government, your hands are on the wheel. you told us you're in charge, and we're now going to engage with you directly and intensely. because if things head south, you're the one who's going to have to be responsible with respect to controlling your own ministers,'"" he said. miller said he predicts the relationship between the two administrations will be publicly non-confrontational, especially as biden looks to ensure he is seen as pro-israel ahead of a potential us reelection campaign. the far-right elements of the new israeli government, meanwhile, have already exacerbated tensions between israelis and palestinians. the new national security minister itamar ben gvir has previously been convicted for supporting terrorism and inciting anti-arab racism. earlier this year, after being named minister, he visited the jerusalem compound known as temple mount by jews and the haram al-sharif or noble sanctuary by muslims, in a move that drew international condemnation. although he visited during open hours for non-muslims, his visit was seen as controversial because ben gvir has publicly called for changes to the delicate status quo agreement that governs the compound. state department spokesman ned price responded at the time by saying that the us believed the visit has ""the potential to exacerbate tensions and to provoke violence."" although the biden administration has advocated for a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict, there has been very little movement and seemingly few active efforts toward that goal. it is something that blinken will address during his meetings with israelis and palestinians, said leaf, the state department official. miller said he does not expect any progress to be made on this issue during blinken's visit, which will instead be more of an ""extended condolence call"" due to the synagogue attack in jerusalem friday. jeremy ben-ami, the president of the advocacy group j-street, which pushes for a two-state solution, said that he believes blinken's trip is well-timed, and sends an important message about american involvement. he said the administration should try to articulate both privately to the new israeli government as well as publicly the things that the us would find unacceptable, such as ""plans for what amounts to de facto annexation of territory on the west bank.""",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.6973322769006093,0.04675968984762827,0.022574729907015957,-0.7666666666666666,0,0,0,0,-0.7666666666666666,1.9302087656159679,7.0,0.2757441093737097
"As Israel bans Palestinian flags, one artist protests with his brush",2023-01-25,25.0,"just over a decade ago, the palestinian flag hung alongside israeli and american flags at the israeli prime minister's residence, when benjamin netanyahu and palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas shared a historic handshake. today, netanyahu is back in power and abbas never left, but many other things have changed, including israel's attitude toward the palestinian flag. this month, new israeli national security minister itamar ben gvir ordered police to take down palestinian flags in any public place in israel, claiming they are a rallying symbol for terrorists. at least one artist felt forced to respond to ben gvir's decree. as soon as he heard about the minister's order, tel aviv-based visual artist michael rozanov drew himself in the colors of the palestinian flag and made the artwork his facebook profile picture. ""it's ridiculous, you want to take down flags? what if i am a flag, what would you do? would you put me down because i'm wearing certain colors?"" said rozanov, known as mysh. ""so i drew this illustration that took me 10 minutes."" he didn't expect it to attract much attention, but dozens of israelis joined mysh, asking him to draw their profile pictures with the palestinian flag in the hope of making some impact. ""and then i thought, yeah, it would be nice to offer other people to join in. because i like drawing and i like starting something online,"" mysh told cnn . naturally, he also drew ben gvir clothed in the colors of the palestinian flag, right up to his kippa, the skullcap worn by religious jews. mysh is far from the only israeli unhappy with netanyahu's new government. the prime minister's right-wing coalition won a slim majority of the popular vote in november's elections, but critics and opponents object to a wide range of its moves, including the palestinian flag public ban, increased deference to the ultra-orthodox and plans to change the judicial system. more than 100,000 people turned out in tel aviv on saturday night, the latest -- and largest -- in a series of weekly protests against legal reforms netanyahu's allies are planning. but not all israelis welcomed mysh's drawings. one commenter on facebook accused mysh of ""spreading a flag of hate,"" adding: ""what a bummer."" another said: ""what does this want to say? that it is now cool to belong to a nation that has surrendered to its terrorist leaders? hamas doesn't want peace with us, what's not clear?"" mysh made a point of replying to each comment to explain and even try to convince his critics. but he believes that ben gvir's attempt to publicly ban the palestinian flag -- which is technically legal to fly in israel -- is a continuation of the direction israel has been moving toward since its founding in 1948. ""it's definitely a step forward for the craziness, but nothing surprising,"" mysh said. ""i think what we see now is the shattering of this illusion that most israelis try to maintain, that they can live in a liberal democracy that respects all human rights, while simultaneously robbing five million people more of the same basic rights,"" he said, referring to the palestinian population. an artist who uses different media -- film and animation, illustration and comics -- to address social and political issues, as well as sexuality and gender, mysh came to israel as a teenager from latvia in 1993 and served in its army for three years. but one day doing his reserve service at an israeli checkpoint in the jordan valley, he says he had a powerful insight into the palestinian experience. ""the only reason that checkpoint existed was to make the life of the people in the village more difficult,"" mysh said. ""we were checking the same people twice every day. they were mostly mothers who take their children to kindergarten on the other side of the village."" ""there was a day when i was standing there with my gun and another soldier was checking id cards, and suddenly i realized that i am a grown-up man who points a gun at a 3-year-old child. and i say to myself: 'i'm not really pointing at him. i'm just standing like this.' yeah, but he doesn't know that. what he sees is this scary creature pointing a f**king gun."" ""it suddenly hit me, the perspective of the other side, which is this child that twice a day sees this monster pointing a gun at him. what are the chances that this child grows up being ready to see me as a human being as i am? how can i expect him to perceive me as a human being? then i decided i'm out of this. i'm not doing this anymore,"" mysh said. mysh sees a direct connection between israel's military checkpoints and ben gvir's attempt to essentially ban the palestinian flag, which is likely to be tested in court. ""every oppressive system is a weak system because it can't withstand any friction,"" mysh argued. ""it needs to enforce a huge amount of violence to avoid friction."" that is what ben gvir is trying to achieve, mysh said: ""it is an idea that in order to achieve our national identity, we need to take it away from other people."" the digest nato negotiations between sweden, finland and turkey delayed -- finnish fm finland's foreign minister pekka haavisto told cnn on tuesday the country's joint nato membership bid with sweden is delayed amid reignited tensions with turkey. ""of course, this is not good news,"" he said. the delay follows protests in stockholm over the weekend that included the burning of a copy of the quran. background: turkish state broadcaster trt haber reported tuesday that scheduled negotiations between the three nations in february have been postponed upon ankara's request. turkish president recep tayyip erdogan warned sweden on monday that it should not expect to receive any support from turkey for backing the country to join nato in light of the protests. haavisto indicated in the cnn interview there are no plans for finland to proceed with its nato membership bid without its nordic neighbor: ""we are not in a hurry, we have time to go together with sweden,"" he told cnn. why it matters: turkey's erdogan has been caught in a spat with his nato allies over his obstruction of sweden and finland's accession to the western alliance. turkey has cited the nordic countries' ""support for terrorist groups,"" mainly kurdish militant groups, as a key reason for its objection. the recent burning of a quran in stockholm, which ignited outrage across the muslim world, has further strained negotiations, all of which come months ahead of a presidential election in turkey that erdogan hopes will allow him to rule into a third decade. haavisto added he hopes negotiations can resume after the turkish election in may. battle continues over beirut port explosion probe lebanese judiciary officials clashed on tuesday over the reopening of an investigation into the 2020 beirut port explosion. the inquiry was reopened by judge tarik bitar on monday, but was rejected by attorney general ghassan oweidat, who insisted that the investigation remains suspended and that no decision had been taken on whether bitar could continue investigating. background: the inquiry into the blast had been paralyzed for more than a year by political confrontation and complaints filed by top officials who were sought for questioning. the massive explosion that took place in beirut's port on august 4, 2020 left more than 200 people dead and thousands injured. the damage was estimated at between $3.8 and $4.6 billion. why it matters: reopening the investigation may bring hope to countless victims whose lives were uprooted by the deadly blast. many are still eager to see accountability for the incident. israeli pm meets jordan's king in amman in first trip abroad since returning to office israeli prime minister netanyahu on tuesday held talks with king abdullah in jordan. the visit comes amid heightened tensions between the two countries over a jerusalem site holy to both muslims and jews over which jordan has custodianship in israeli-occupied east jerusalem. background: tensions have been high over the flashpoint complex known as haram al-sharif to muslims and temple mount to jews. it contains the al-aqsa mosque, the third holiest site in islam, and the site of the destroyed first and second jewish temples, the holiest site to jews. only muslims are allowed to pray at the complex under a decades-old agreement. however, israel's far-right national security minister ben gvir, who in a controversial move visited the site two weeks ago, believes that jews should have the right to pray there too. king abdullah told cnn in december that jordan is willing to work with ""anybody and everybody"" in israel to bring peace, but won't allow ""red lines"" over jerusalem to be crossed, referring to al-aqsa mosque. why it matters: this is netanyahu's first trip abroad since reassuming israel's premiership last month, and his first visit to amman and meeting with abdullah since june 2018. it comes just two weeks after ben gvir's visit to the site, which drew widespread international condemnation, including from jordan's royal court. after the visit, abdullah stressed the need for israel to respect ""the historical and legal status quo"" of the al-aqsa mosque compound. palestinians immediately objected to the visit. what's trending regional: aire american social media star kylie jenner's baby son was trending on twitter in several arab countries -- for all the wrong reasons. jenner revealed her 11-month-old son's name to the public on sunday. arabs swiftly took to social media to poke fun at it. the name, aire, means penis or 'my penis' in levantine arabic, and is often used as profanity. ""umm should someone tell kylie jenner she renamed her son aire which is a common arabic expression for 'my penis' or nah?"" tweeted journalist antoinette lattouf to her 13,000 followers. even the head of the american-arab anti-discrimination committee (adc) weighed in. ""arabic speakers are having a field day with this. the arabic language is full of beautiful words, many of them are used for names,"" abed a. ayoub, national executive director of the adc, tweeted in jest to his 15,000 followers. ""i hope he doesn't have any arab friends when he's older."" jenner, 25, is mother to aire webster and 4-year-old stormie webster. this is not the first time such a name made news in levantine countries, which include lebanon, syria, jordan and the palestinian territories. in 2012, arabic news outlets found themselves in a tough spot when jean-marc ayrault became the prime minister of france. the french pronunciation of his name also means ""his penis"" in levantine arabic. many arabic outlets chose to pronounce his name with the l, which is meant to be silent. cnn arabic similarly decided to transliterate ayrault's name as it is written, with last two letters, rather than how it's spoken. the french foreign ministry at",6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.25788557327662903,0.4732689708471298,0.2688454693804185,0.07554037560592576,0,0,0,0,0.4532422536355546,2.1079984877561087,12.0,0.17566654064634238
Iran's regime is trying to execute its way out of trouble,2023-01-23,26.0,"the cries of the women outside a tehran courthouse swell to a collective wail. the gathering is reminiscent of a vigil, but it is one of the vestiges of a nationwide uprising that has all but died down after the iranian judiciary's breathless handing down of death sentences in recent weeks. children stand at the front of the courthouse protest chanting ""no to execution"" in a january 14 video shared by the human rights activists news agency (hrana). despite the blurring of faces in the video, one girl can be seen wiping her tears. she appears no older than 10 years. the nationwide uprising that began in mid-september convulsed iran, posing the biggest domestic threat to the ruling clerical class in more than a decade. it penetrated the regime's conservative support base and produced countless acts of defiance -- and sometimes violence -- against the formidable basij, a voluntary paramilitary group that is the fulcrum of the islamic republic's security apparatus. the protesters were young and angry, and a barrier of fear appeared to have broken. four months on, the protests have fizzled out amid a growing wave of repression against demonstrators. four protesters have been executed by the regime; many others fear the same fate. the executions are the culmination of an increasingly violent crackdown including the gunning down of protesters, mass arrests, physical assault and sexual violence. the regime has also doubled down on the repression of dissidents, ethnic minorities and women. iran's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei has chalked the protests up to a foreign conspiracy and has called them an ""act of treason."" another factor working against the protesters: most people over the age of 25 have steered clear of the demonstrations, analysts and activists said. this deprived the protest movement of the momentum needed to topple a heavily sanctioned regime over which the international community has little to no remaining leverage. still, iran analysts agree that the regime has kicked the can down the road, and that protests are likely to resurface. iran's clerical leadership is either unwilling or unable to address its festering economic problems, exacerbated by a us sanctions regime and by widespread corruption. ""people's anger has increased, not decreased,"" said a 25-year-old activist from the southeast of the country who asked not to be named due to concern for his safety. ""if there were no guns in the hands of security forces, large masses of people would stage an insurrection tomorrow."" almost 20,000 people have been arrested according to activists. more than 500, including dozens of children, have been killed, according to hrana. the repressive methods have left iran's protesters in a catch-22 situation. disgruntlement against the regime appears to be spreading, but its use of brute force has deterred protesters from growing to the level needed to force the regime to stand down. the absence of a critical mass created a ""mathematical problem"" for the protest movement, said ali vaez, international crisis group's director of the iran project. ""the majority will only join in when the regime has lost its will to suppress,"" he told cnn. ""and the regime's will to suppress is unlikely to crack unless there is a critical mass on the streets."" vaez compares the state of affairs in iran to the soviet union in the early 1980s, a period of public frustration and dire economic conditions that years later prompted the string of reforms, known as perestroika, that preceded the ussr's collapse. ""(the islamic republic) is where the soviet union was in early 1980s ... it is ideologically bankrupt, is economically in deep trouble and is simply unable to reform itself,"" said vaez. ""unlike the soviet union in the late 1980s, (iran) still has the will to fight."" ""one can conclude that the protests will re-emerge sooner rather than later in a more ferocious manner,"" he added. the chilling effect of executions echoes of the uprising continue to reverberate in the country. every night in tehran, , chants of ""death to the dictator"" ring out from rooftops and from behind drawn curtains, out of the sight of security forces. anti-regime protests continue to crop up in some of the country's minority-dominated border regions which bore the brunt of the regime's crackdown. on friday, thousands of people poured into the streets of baloch-majority zahedan city after noon prayers, demanding the fall of the regime. the kurdish-majority west of the country continues to be peppered by gatherings marking the end of 40-day mourning periods for slain protesters. ""kurdistan, kurdistan, the graveyard of fascists,"" mourners chanted in a video shared by iranian-kurdish human rights group hengaw on january 16. the mourners raised roses in the air to commemorate hooman abdullahi, a protester who was shot and killed by security forces. for activists, the endurance of the protests among ethnic minorities is a sign of what's to come. the executions, they say, will eventually backfire. at least 18 protesters have been sentenced to death as of now, with only five having won the right to appeal, according to hrna. more than 100 protesters have been charged with crimes that carry the death penalty. four people have been executed already, including high-profile prisoners such as a karate champion and children's coach. ""people are more angry after we realized how fast and hastily they hanged those men,"" said one activist in iran who does not want to be identified for security reasons and calls himself mr. z. ""i think they compressed the spring more. next time, people won't even be afraid of being hanged,"" he told cnn. the executions have drawn sharp condemnation from the international community. reports, including cnn's own reporting, suggest that most protesters are being denied due process, with speedy trials and access only to state-appointed lawyers. but the death sentences have also had a chilling effect, mostly on the older generation of iranians who largely stayed off the street and who are now trying to keep their children at home, activists say. ""nobody wants to hold a picture of their kid,"" said one activist outside iran, referring to mothers carrying photos of their slain and arrested sons and daughters. the images have been ubiquitous since the start of the protests. ""but the kids want to build their future,"" said the activist, known as mamlekate, who has played a key role in distributing photos and video from the protests, and in connecting journalists to sources in the country. ""if the kids don't do it, who's going to do it?"" he told cnn. ""this is far from over."" the digest netanyahu dismisses key ally aryeh deri after high court order israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu dismissed key ally aryeh deri from all ministerial posts on sunday, complying with a ruling by israel's highest court that it was unreasonable to appoint the shas party leader to positions in government. netanyahu told deri he made the move ""with a heavy heart, with great sorrow,"" according to a statement from the prime minister's office. background: the court had said deri's appointment ""cannot stand"" due to his criminal convictions and because he had said in court last year before being sentenced over a tax fraud conviction that he would retire from public life. the ruling was a dramatic move amid an unprecedented confrontation between his government and the judiciary. why it matters: netanyahu's government is planning major judicial reforms, which include a series of changes announced earlier this month that would allow parliament to overturn high court decisions and give politicians more power in appointing judges. more than 100,000 people protested saturday night in central tel aviv, the largest in a series of demonstrations against the planned changes. prominent egyptian businessman and his son released from prison safwan thabet, founder and former ceo of juhayna food industries, and his son seifeldin thabet were released from prison in egypt on saturday following almost two years in pretrial detention. the businessmen's release comes almost two weeks after a loan agreement with the international monetary fund (imf) called for stronger support for the private sector as one of its key demands. background: safwan was arrested in december 2020, and his son was later summoned and arrested in february 2021. they were both accused of ""belonging to and financing terrorist groups,"" but were never formally charged. the businessmen's case gained international traction over the last two years, and in september 2021 amnesty international said the incident shows ""just how far the egyptian authorities are willing to go to exert control and exposes how terrorism-related accusations are ruthlessly exploited in today's egypt"". why it matters: the listed company juhayna is egypt's largest producer of dairy and juice products. in 2021, it had a 58% market share in the milk segment. it is unclear why the two men were released, which comes just two weeks after the imf released details of its $3 billion extended fund facility to egypt, in which egypt pledges to ""reduce the state footprint"" in the private sector. eu approves new iran sanctions package, says iran guards terrorist designation requires court decision in member state european union foreign policy chief josep borrell on monday said any decision to designate iran's revolutionary guards (irgc) as a terrorist organization would first require a court decision in a member state. background: the european parliament on thursday approved a resolution calling on the bloc to designate the irgc as a terrorist group. and on monday, the eu approved a new package of sanctions on iran amid the country's crackdown on protests at home. why it matters: borrell's statement comes amid conflicting reports from iranian politicians about potential retaliatory action should the eu move forward with the terrorist designation. the vice chairman of the internal affairs and councils commission in the iranian parliament, mohammad hassan asfari, on monday said that shuttering the strait of hormuz to european commercial ships is ""on the table,"" according to local media. shortly afterwards, parliament spokesman nizamuddin mousavi said that there is no plan on the parliament's agenda to close down the strait. the strait, which lies off iran's southern coast, is only 21 miles wide at its narrowest point. one third of the world's seaborne oil passes through it. around the region conservatives in jordan's parliament are up in arms over a locally produced netflix film that depicts crime and corruption in the country.

US and Israel launch largest military exercise ever despite concerns over Netanyahu's government,2023-01-23,27.0,"the us and israel launched their largest joint military exercise ever on monday, sending a clear signal to iran and underscoring the strength of their alliance despite concerns over the composition of the new israeli government which includes ultra-nationalist and ultra-religious parties. the live-fire exercise, named juniper oak, will include 100 us aircraft with fighters, bombers and refueling aircraft flying alongside 42 israeli aircraft. the uss george h. w. bush carrier strike group will also take part in the exercise, which will cover all the domains of warfare to include space and electronic warfare. ""we can't really find another (exercise) that even kind of comes close,"" said a senior us defense official. nearly 6,500 us personnel will participate in the exercise, as well as more than 1,100 israeli personnel, the official said. the exercise comes despite concern over the makeup of israel's new government under prime minister benjamin netanyahu who has appointed ministers once considered to be on the extreme nationalist fringes of israeli politics including the far-right otzma yehudit party and the noam party, which is opposed to lgbtq rights. the us official acknowledged the possibility for disagreements with the nascent government but stressed the non-negotiable bipartisan commitment to israel. ""the security commitment that we have to israel is irrespective of the particular personalities and particular government,"" the us official said. in december, us secretary of state antony blinken said israel's government will be gauged on its ""policies and procedures, rather than individual personalities."" the exercise comes as tensions between the us and iran remain high. the biden administration has introduced sanctions on tehran following a brutal crackdown on protests in the country which have seen protesters executed. negotiations for a new nuclear agreement have also stalled. netanyahu has consistently taken a hardline stance towards iran, vowing upon the swearing in of his new government to ""thwart iran's effort to obtain nuclear weapons."" as recently as sunday, netanyahu said the us and israel would hold meetings on iran in the coming weeks, following a visit from us national security adviser jake sullivan. ""i was impressed that there is a genuine and mutual desire to reach understandings on this issue,"" netanyahu said at the meeting. exercise came together quickly the exercise, which marks a major increase in cooperation between the us and israeli militaries, came together quickly, the official said, especially for something of this scale. normally, such a large exercise involving so many different forces would take a year or more of planning, but his exercise came together in two months, the official said. planning began under the previous israeli government of yair lapid and finished under the current one. us central command will lead the exercise. israel was moved to central command's area of responsibility in september 2021 following the announcement of the change towards the end of the trump administration. despite the shift and the burgeoning ties between israel and gulf arab countries, none of those countries will take part in the exercise. instead, the us official said they will be briefed on its after its conclusion later in the week. ""these kinds of exercises -- which centcom routinely conducts with our partners -- develop interoperability between military forces, increase military capabilities and are important to the security and stability of the region,"" said gen. michael erik kurilla, the commander of us central command, in a statement. ""the lessons learned during these exercises are exportable to our partners across the region."" a previous us-israel military exercise held in late-november was described by israel's military, the israel defense forces (idf), as a simulation of a ""long-range operational scenario and long-distance flights,"" including a ""campaign against distant countries,"" a thinly-veiled reference to iran. the us official stressed that this exercise was not intended to be a simulation of an attack on iran's nuclear facilities, but the official acknowledged that iran would be watching and taking note. ""i do think that this scale of the exercise is relevant to a whole range of scenarios, and iran may draw certain inferences from that,"" the official said. ""it would not surprise me if iran, you know, sees the scale and the nature of these activities and understands what the two of us are capable of doing."" though the biden administration favored a diplomatic solution to iran's advancing nuclear program, negotiations over reviving the iran nuclear deal, formally known as the joint comprehensive plan of action (jcpoa), stalled. iran's violent crackdown on domestic protests and its provision of suicide drones to russia's military have made the prospects of reviving the deal even more remote. israel, which was vehemently against a return to the jcpoa, pushed for a more aggressive us posture toward iran and has promised to act against iranian forces in the region. the us has repeatedly promised under democrat and republican administrations that iran will not be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons. ""we would prefer a diplomatic outcome,"" the us official said, ""but we have other capabilities, if required."" the exercise also comes as the pentagon shifts its focus away from the middle east and central asia. the national defense strategy identifies china as the challenge of the future, while dealing with the threats posed by russia. the consequence has been a dramatic decline in the us military footprint in central command. the us has about 35,000 troops in the region now, a far cry from a decade and a half ago when the us had nearly 200,000 troops in iraq and afghanistan alone. but this exercise is intended to show the ability of the us to move large forces into the region in a short period. ""we still have the excess capacity to be able to flex to another high-priority area of responsibility and conduct an exercise on this scale,"" said the senior us defense official.",4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.280844162160065,0.4645311012864113,0.254624729976058,0.22355331028528608,0,0,0,0,0.8942132411411443,1.8782185319464064,15.0,0.1252145687964271
Netanyahu dismisses key ally Aryeh Deri after High Court order,2023-01-22,28.0,"israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu dismissed key ally aryeh deri from all ministerial posts on sunday, complying with an israeli high court ruling that it was unreasonable to appoint the shas party leader to positions in government. the court had said deri's appointment ""cannot stand"" due to his criminal convictions and because he had said in court last year before being sentenced over a tax fraud conviction that he would retire from public life. netanyahu told deri he made the move ""with a heavy heart, with great sorrow,"" according to a statement from the prime minister's office. deri's dismissal came the day after more than 100,000 people protested in central tel aviv against netanyahu's government and its planned judicial reforms, according to police estimates in israeli media. thousands more people protested in jerusalem and other israeli cities, police said. this is the third week that opponents of netanyahu's government took to the streets in protest, but the largest turnout so far. netanyahu's justice minister yariv levin announced a series of judicial reforms earlier this month that would allow parliament to overturn high court decisions and give politicians more power in appointing judges. on wednesday, the high court ruled that netanyahu must fire deri, who was previously convicted on criminal charges including tax offenses. deri served a suspended sentence and said he would leave public office. deri's shas party -- which won 11 seats in israel's 120-seat parliament, the knesset, in november and is a key component of netanyahu's coalition -- immediately hit back, calling the court decision ""arbitrary and unprecedented."" the sephardi religious party said the court ""today threw away the voices and votes of 400,000 voters of the shas movement."" ""today the court actually ruled that the elections are meaningless. the court's decision is political and tainted,"" the party said. the high court had been asked to rule on whether it was legally reasonable to appoint deri to posts in netanyahu's cabinet despite his tax fraud conviction. judges ruled that his appointment ""cannot stand."" ""this is, among other things, due to his backlog of criminal convictions,"" and his failure to retire from public life as he said he would do when being sentenced in the tax fraud case. opposition leaders, including former prime minister yair lapid and former defense minister benny gantz, attended saturday's protest in tel aviv. ""what you see here today is a demonstration in favor of the state. people who love the country came to defend its democracy, its courts, the idea of a common life and a common good,"" lapid tweeted. ""there are israel lovers here who came to demonstrate for a democratic jewish state according to the values of the declaration of independence. we will not give upuntilwewin.""

Israel's democracy on the brink amid supreme court showdown with Netanyahu,2023-01-20,29.0,"israel's highest court this week ordered prime minister benjamin netanyahu to fire a key ally, a dramatic move amid an unprecedented confrontation between his government and the judiciary. the high court ruled 10-1 on wednesday that it was unreasonable for aryeh deri, leader of the sephardic ultra-orthodox party shas, to serve as a minister. he was appointed interior and health minister just three weeks ahead of the ruling. but so far, netanyahu has not taken any action, as political tensions mount. israel media reported friday deri and netanyahu are in the midst of negotiations over the situation. deri has several convictions on his record, most recently on tax charges. last year he struck a plea bargain with the courts, which saw him serve a suspended sentence after he resigned from parliament and pledged not to return to public office. under israeli law, people convicted of crimes cannot serve as ministers. but netanyahu's government passed an amendment to that law earlier this month that essentially created a loophole for deri. in wednesday's ruling, the justices narrowly focused on netanyahu's appointment of deri despite his assertion he would leave political life as part of the deal for the suspended sentence. but less than a year after that plea bargain was struck, netanyahu has now been told he needs to fire deri -- whose 11 seats in parliament he needs to stay in power. ""this is a dramatic decision. the decision is aimed at the prime minister, not deri,"" said yaniv roznai, an associate professor and co-director at the rubinstein center for constitutional challenges, reichman university in israel. since the ruling, netanyahu hasn't reacted much beyond going to see deri and issuing general words of support. cnn has reached out to his office for further comment. ""when my brother is in distress -- i come to him,"" netanyahu said as he went to visit deri after the ruling on wednesday. in a joint statement the same day, the heads of the coalition parties led by netanyahu's party likud said: ""we will act in any legal way that is available to us and without delay, to correct the injustice and the serious damage caused to the democratic decision and the sovereignty of the people."" deri has seemingly vowed to find a way around the ruling, proclaiming: ""they will close the door for us, we will enter through the window. they will close the window for us, we will break through the ceiling."" but most political and legal experts believe it's extremely unlikely that netanyahu or deri would defy the court's ruling, or that deri will pull his shas party out of netanyahu's coalition, a move that would cause the government to fall. yonatan green, executive director of the israel law and liberty forum, told reporters in a briefing that while he thinks netanyahu is expected to follow the court order in this case, it sets the stage for future defiance. ""each successive case of this kind probably brings us a little bit closer to that particular brink,"" green said. and so experts say one of the most likely paths forward is for netanyahu to fire deri, and for the government to bulldoze through judicial reforms that it has already announced. judicial reform the deri ruling comes amid an ongoing battle that has been raging over the judiciary. netanyahu's justice minister, yariv levin, announced in early january a series of judicial reforms that would give parliament (and by extension the parties in power) the ability to overturn supreme court rulings, appoint judges, and remove from ministries legal advisers whose legal advice is binding. if parliament gets such powers, it could create a path for deri to return. but critics say it could also help netanyahu end his ongoing corruption trial. netanyahu has repeatedly denied in multiple interviews that the changes would be for his own benefit. backers of the reforms have long accused the high court of overreach and elitism. they say the changes would restore balance between the branches of government. but opponents including former prime minister yair lapid and the president of the israeli supreme court esther hayut say it will erode israel's independent judiciary, weaken the checks and balances between the branches and spell the beginning of the end of israel's democracy. ""if aryeh deri is not fired, the israeli government is breaking the law. a government that does not obey the law is an illegal government,"" lapid tweeted. it was these proposed judicial reforms that drove some 80,000 people onto the streets of tel aviv in pouring rain on saturday to protest the changes. organizers hope the protest spurs a movement and mounting public pressure on netanyahu to back off or limit the scope of the proposed reforms. the digest uae and india discussing settling non-oil trade in rupees the united arab emirates is in early discussions with india to trade non-oil commodities in indian rupees, reuters cited emirati minister for foreign trade thani al zeyoudi as saying on thursday. background: the uae last year signed a wide-ranging free trade agreement with india, which, along with china, is among the biggest trade partners for gulf arab oil and gas producers, most of whose currencies are pegged to the us dollar. the large majority of gulf trade is conducted in us dollars but countries such as india and china are increasingly seeking to pay in local currencies for reasons including lowering transaction costs. why it matters: other countries, including china, have also raised the issue of settling non-oil trade payments in local currencies, the minister said, but discussions weren't at an advanced stage. china's president in december visited saudi arabia where he participated in a gulf arab summit and called for oil trade in yuan as beijing seeks to establish its currency internationally. the saudi finance minister said this week that the kingdom would be open to trade in other currencies aside from the us dollar. turkey's opposition to announce presidential candidate to challenge erdogan turkey's opposition alliance is set to announce in february their presidential candidate to challenge president tayyip erdogan's 20-year rule in elections set for may, reuters cited an opposition party official as saying on friday. the six-party alliance is seeking to forge a united platform but has yet to agree a candidate to challenge erdogan for the presidency. background: turkey's two main opposition parties, the secularist chp and center-right nationalist iyi party, have allied themselves with four smaller parties under a platform that would seek to dismantle erdogan's executive presidency in favor of the previous parliamentary system. why it matters: turkey is heading towards one of the most consequential votes in the century-long history of the modern republic and erdogan signaled on wednesday that the presidential and parliament elections would be on may 14, a month ahead of schedule. kuwaiti leader frees jailed critics in effort to build political cohesion kuwait's emir sheikh nawaf al-ahmad al-sabah has pardoned dozens of jailed critics under a new amnesty in an effort to end political feuding that has hampered fiscal reforms as tensions surface between the new government and parliament, reuters reported. the amnesty pardoned 34 kuwaitis, most of them convicted for voicing public criticism. background: kuwait has the region's liveliest parliament and tolerates criticism to a degree that is rare among gulf arab states, but the emir has the final say in state affairs and criticizing him is a jailable offence. the cabinet on tuesday voiced hope that the latest amnesty, which followed the pardoning of dozens of political dissidents in 2021 in a nod to opposition demands, would ""create an atmosphere of fruitful cooperation"". why it matters: opposition members made big gains in elections held in september. tensions recently resurfaced as lawmakers pressed the government for a debt relief bill under which the state would buy citizens' personal loans -- a measure that past governments have taken but which comes as the oil producer seeks to push through fiscal reforms to bolster state finances. around the region conservative gulf arab states rarely send contestants to international beauty pageants, many of which include segments where women are presented in revealing swimsuits. but one contestant from the tiny gulf state of bahrain avoided that taboo by participating in this year's miss universe in new orleans in a pink burkini swimsuit that covered her from the neck down, including her arms. as 24-year-old evlin khalifa walked down the catwalk, she unfurled a cape with a flag of bahrain and the word ""equality"" in arabic. a message in english read: ""arab women should be represented... a muslim woman can also become a miss universe."" the pianist and taekwondo black-belt told the uae's the national newspaper that she decided to participate in order to ""break stereotypes."" ""arab women are kind, passionate and brave and they are ready to embrace the challenges of life,"" she said.

"Jacinda Ardern, like George Washington, knew when to quit",2023-01-20,30.0,"""nothing in his life became him like the leaving it,"" william shakespeare writes of an executed rebel in ""macbeth."" today's leaders, however, often struggle to embrace an equivalent vision of a dignified exit from political life when their time comes. jacinda ardern is the rare leader who is choosing to leave the stage, not to be pushed off it. new zealand's prime minister said thursday that she had ""no more in the tank"" after five years in power and would not seek reelection. unlike leaders who go on too long, who are forced out by rebellious colleagues, rejected by their own parties, turfed out by voters, refusing to admit they lost elections, perennially plotting to return or resort to autocracy to cling onto power, ardern's stay in power will be enhanced by the leaving of it. her self-awareness is on brand for a politician who became a progressive global icon while donald trump-style ego populism swept the globe. her leadership during covid-19 and after mass shootings at two mosques in 2019 won ardern admiration far from new zealand. a cynic might argue that she simply saw the writing on the wall: ardern's popularity has ebbed and her labour party trails in the polls amid rising crime, high inflation and falling home prices. but there would have been time to mount a comeback before the general election that she called for october. the price of power for ardern, 42, has been arduous. she's faced abuse and threats linked to her gender and relative youth. she has a young daughter and wants to marry her partner; spending time with family isn't just the classic politicians' face-saving excuse here. for many presidents and prime ministers, the ambition and drive that got them to the top means that they struggle to contemplate voluntarily ceding power. this truism led 20th century british parliamentarian enoch powell to note: ""all political lives, unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture, end in failure, because that is the nature of politics and of human affairs."" in 1987, british pm margaret thatcher said she hoped to go ""on and on."" three years later she was gone, forced out by a revolt in her own conservative party after years in power made her regally remote and a growing electoral liability. some leaders have the mercy of term limits which make the decision for them. us presidents barack obama, bill clinton and ronald reagan for instance left their voters wanting more after hitting the two-term maximum. other presidents suffered the pain of being told to go home, like jimmy carter, george h.w. bush and trump who all lost reelection races. although if you ask the election-denying trump, he thinks he should now be halfway through his second term, reserving for himself a unique category of post-power political disgrace. the one-term curse also claimed french presidents nicolas sarkozy and francois hollande (whose unpopularity toward the end of his term made any reelection dreams unviable.) it's less common now, thankfully, but fate sometimes makes a politician's choices for them. both abraham lincoln and john f. kennedy were assassinated, and franklin roosevelt died of natural causes while in office. around the world and more recently, north korea's kim jong il, president john magufuli of tanzania and prime minister hamed bakayoko of ivory coast also died of illnesses in office. then there are the leaders who don't want to go, but are pushed or who are forced out by deteriorating political circumstances. the bloody toll of the vietnam war and his own tumbling popularity convinced president lyndon johnson to tell americans, ""i shall not seek and i will not accept the nomination of my party as your president"" in a shock announcement in 1968 that continues to help define his legacy. even some of the strongest leaders can be forced out early by ambitious colleagues pining for their own chance. this happened in canada early in the century when finance minister paul martin's long campaign to force prime minister jean chretien into retirement paid off. but martin's own premiership was short and troubled and didn't approach his success in his previous job. exactly the same happened in the uk, when chancellor gordon brown finally elbowed out tony blair after his decade in 10 downing street in 2007, then struggled as prime minister and lost the 2010 election. his failure paved the way for a long period of conservative party rule that still endures. those tories by the way have a particular penchant for political regicide before voters get the chance. the three most-recent ex-pms, liz truss, boris johnson and theresa may were all effectively felled by their own party, though johnson may hope to emulate his hero winston churchill in trying to engineer a return to number 10 after a humiliating political defeat. israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu meanwhile is proving yet again that comebacks can happen -- but seems perpetually doomed to a thin hold on power. megalomania and tyranny lie in wait when a leader begins to see themselves as the personification of their nations. vladimir putin effectively dismantled the russian political system in order to wield power for two decades and counting during various terms as president and prime minister. his growing isolation and sense of his own omnipotence now seems to have led him into an unprovoked invasion that has not only devastated ukraine but has also turned russia into an international pariah. chinese leader xi jinping just accepted a norm-busting third term -- only for his aura to be tarnished by his mishandling of the pandemic. the world is watching with some concern as xi becomes more militaristic the longer he stays in power. ardern has spared herself the indignities of outstaying her welcome or being forced to go by mutinous colleagues. in her resignation speech, she confessed: ""politicians are human. we give all that we can for as long as we can and then it's time. and for me, it's time."" she might have been channeling an exhausted george washington, who told americans in his farewell address in 1796 that he hoped that ""whatever partiality may be retained for my services, that in the present circumstances of our country you will not disapprove my determination to retire."" like ardern, the first american president understood that in a democracy, the hardest thing is not winning power but knowing when to cede it.",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.4189181068669195,0.07247571938711664,0.18251922726631165,-0.6739101370205542,0,0,0,0,-0.6739101370205542,-11.526592479199257,32.0,-0.3602060149749768
"Key Netanyahu ally cannot serve as cabinet minister, Israel's top court rules, sparking potential political crisis",2023-01-18,31.0,"israel's top court ruled 10-1 on wednesday that aryeh deri, leader of the shas party and a key ally of prime minister benjamin netanyahu, should not be allowed to serve as a cabinet minister because of a february 2022 conviction for tax fraud. netanyahu should remove deri from his post, the court ruling said. such a move would risk plunging the country into a political crisis. deri's shas party -- which won 11 seats in israel's 120-seat parliament, the knesset, in november and is a key component of netanyahu's coalition -- immediately hit back, calling the court decision ""arbitrary and unprecedented."" the sephardi religious party said the court ""today threw away the voices and votes of 400,000 voters of the shas movement."" ""today the court actually ruled that the elections are meaningless. the court's decision is political and tainted,"" the party said. the high court had been asked to rule on whether it was legally reasonable to appoint deri to posts in netanyahu's cabinet despite his tax fraud conviction judges ruled that his appointment ""cannot stand."" ""this is, among other things, due to his backlog of criminal convictions,"" and his failure to retire from public life as he said he would do when being sentenced in the tax fraud case. the underlying legal issue is whether deri's tax fraud conviction constitutes a crime of moral turpitude. until november's elections, that would have disqualified him from serving in government. but netanyahu and his allies made a change to the law in the wake of their election victory, clearing the way for deri to become a minister. deri was a member of the knesset at the time of his tax fraud conviction last year. he resigned as a lawmaker rather than giving the head of the election commission a chance to rule on whether the conviction disqualified him from serving as a minister. this means that the legal question of whether deri's fraud conviction counts as a crime of moral turpitude remains unresolved. deri allies have been signaling this week that the shas party leader would not resign his ministerial post even if the court ruling went against him. in a statement made to his fellow party members gathered at his house, deri on wednesday said he would ""continue the revolution even more strongly with and more force,"" without going into detail. his refusal to resign -- or netanyahu's refusal to sack him -- potentially sets up a constitutional crisis pitting the government against the high court. netanyahu and his coalition partners have 64 seats in the 120-seat knesset, a majority of four. deri's shas party holds 11 of those 64 seats, so dismissing deri would plunge the government into crisis. on wednesday evening local time netanyahu was seen visiting deri's home, spending around 45 minutes inside before leaving again. netanyahu did not make any comment to journalists who were outside. justice minister yariv levin -- a member of netanyahu's likud party -- vowed to intervene on deri's behalf. ""i will do everything necessary so that the crying injustice done to rabbi aryeh deri, to the shas movement and to israeli democracy will be fully corrected,"" levin said. levin has already announced plans to change israel's justice system by giving the knesset the power to overrule supreme court decisions and to review nominations to the court. the president of the supreme court, esther hayut -- who was among the 10 judges ruling wednesday that netanyahu should dismiss deri -- last week called the proposed changes ""an unbridled attack on the legal system."" political instability continues israel has been racked by political instability in recent years, with netanyahu winning a slim victory in the fifth israeli election in less than four years in november. netanyahu, who was sworn in as prime minister for the sixth time in his career at the end of december, has remained a dominant figure during a period of protracted political chaos. his latest government is likely to be the most right-wing in israel's history. itamar ben gvir, an extremist who has been convicted for supporting terrorism and inciting anti-arab racism, became national security minister. bezalel smotrich, who has supported abolishing the palestinian authority and annexing the west bank, became finance minister. netanyahu's latest term has got off to a tough start, with tens of thousands of people protesting in tel aviv and jerusalem on january 14 against his government's proposed changes to the israeli judicial system. attendees held signs comparing netanyahu to russian president vladimir putin, and saying israel was turning into the likes of semi-democratic hungary and theocratic iran. protesters told cnn they came out of fear for israel's future and to send a message to netanyahu that the public wouldn't stand for what they see as the dismantling of israeli democracy.",16.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.46477459417656064,0.3588872140389867,0.17633819695038255,-0.3181309235243915,0,0,0,0,-5.090094776390264,-17.397547941957345,45.0,-0.386612176487941

Opinions are divided,2023-01-16,33.0,"this year's cop28 climate summit is mired in controversy, held in one of the world's biggest oil exporting nations -- the united arab emirates -- and headed by one of the most prominent faces in its oil industry. environmental activists have cried foul, arguing that the climate debate has been hijacked by the fossil fuel lobby to protect the profit-maximizing agendas of petrostates. the uae's involvement has sparked a discussion on whether there's a place in the climate space for countries that rely primarily on fossil fuel exports for their income. and opinions are split. sultan al jaber, who will preside over the november summit, wears two very prominent hats in the uae. aside from being the ceo of the abu dhabi national oil company (adnoc), he is also the uae's climate envoy, tasked with spearheading its energy policy. he took on the climate portfolio over a decade before becoming a top oil executive, helping launch the state's clean energy company masdar in 2006 and bringing the international renewable energy agency's headquarters to abu dhabi in 2009. the message the uae is sending is that both fossil fuels and renewable energy must be part of the global energy mix, and that one does not have to replace the other. it has argued that given the projected growth in global energy demand, both clean and dirty energy will be needed to power the world, and a hasty transition away from oil and gas could have a detrimental effect on the global economy. ""recent events have shown that unplugging the current energy system before we have built a sufficiently robust alternative puts both economic and climate progress at risk -- and calls into question whether we can ensure a just transition that is equitable to all,"" al jaber wrote last year in an opinion piece for project syndicate. the us energy information administration (eia) estimates a nearly 50% increase in global energy use by 2050, with oil and gas remaining the most-consumed sources of energy. tom evans, a policy adviser at the european climate change think tank e3g, told cnn that al jaber's appointment raises questions about the credibility of the uae's cop28 presidency. ""at face value, the head of a national oil company is obviously facing a massive conflict of interest,"" he said. al jaber's dual roles are what make him a ""terrific choice,"" us climate envoy john kerry was cited as saying by the associated press on monday. the company he leads ""knows it needs to transition,"" kerry said. simon stiell, the executive secretary of the united nations framework convention on climate change (unfccc) on monday called the uae's hosting of the summit a ""unique opportunity"" at an environmental summit in abu dhabi. the uae has the expertise ""to get every sector, particularly those hard to abate, aligned with 1.5,"" he said, referring to the climate goal to stay below 1.5 degrees celsius of warming. the uae has touted the mantra of ""maximum energy, minimum emissions,"" saying that instead of phasing out fossil fuels, it will work on making their extraction cleaner, and reinvest its revenues into renewable energy in an effort to raise its share of the nation's energy mix. the country is future-proofing its energy sector and will ""celebrate"" the last barrel of oil it exports, al jaber said at an energy summit in abu dhabi on saturday. over the past 15 years, the uae has invested $40 billion in renewable energy and clean technology globally, according to the atlantic council think tank. last year, it entered a pact with the united states to invest another $100 billion in clean energy. al jaber on saturday called for a tripling of renewable energy output around the world and twice as much money for adaptation in the global south. but that's not enough, climate experts say. ""fossil fuel profits are most certainly not powering investments in clean energy,"" assaad razzouk, a clean energy analyst in singapore, told cnn. ""just look at the spending of oil and gas companies and how that's allocated,"" razzouk said. companies like adnoc and saudi arabia's aramco oil company need to stop investing in oil and gas and spend much more on renewables if they are serious about the transition to clean energy, he added. global campaigner corporate accountability in november described the presence of oil lobbyists at climate summits as ""a rise in the influence of the fossil fuel industry at the climate talks that are already rife with accusations of civil society censorship and corporate influence."" climate experts say the uae's approach of expanding the use of renewables while continuing to extract fossil fuels defies its own commitments. cop28 didn't respond to cnn's request for comment. ""the glasgow climate pact agreed at cop26 in 2021 by all countries, including the uae, calls for a cut of 45% in carbon emissions by 2030,"" mark maslin, a professor working on climate change at university college london, told cnn. ""this can only be achieved if there is no new investment in fossil fuels and the use of all fossil fuels is phased out as soon as possible."" ""so it does not make any sense to invest in fossil fuels when the world needs to be net zero emissions before 2050,"" he added. but the uae is doing quite the opposite. one of the few producers in the opec oil cartel with the capacity to ramp up production on short notice, the uae has repeatedly called for more investment in the oil sector to meet global demand, and has embarked on a project to further increase its own capacity. in november, it brought forward its oil production expansion to 2027 instead of 2030, when it will be producing up to 5 million barrels per day (bpd) from about 4 million. the uae's approach has been pragmatic, said amena bakr, chief opec correspondent at energy intelligence, adding that russia's war on ukraine led nations to prioritize energy security and realize that the world couldn't do away with oil and gas so soon. ""renewable energy still cannot meet base-load energy demand -- that's a fact,"" she told cnn. for razzouk, the clean energy analyst, the conflict has ""incontrovertibly shown the folly of relying on imported fossil fuels, and the national security risks this entailed."" the digest iran hangs british citizen on charges of espionage and corruption a dual british-iranian citizen was hanged by iran on charges of espionage and corruption, a state-affiliated media outlet reported saturday, the latest in a string of executions carried out by a regime grappling with unprecedented protests across the country. alireza akbari was executed for crimes including ""corruption on earth,"" according to the iranian judiciary-affiliated outlet mizan. british prime minister rishi sunak said he was ""appalled by the execution."" foreign secretary james cleverly said saturday afternoon that the british government planned to sanction iran's prosecutor general to underline ""our disgust at alireza akbari's execution."" background: akbari previously served as iran's deputy defense minister and was the head of the strategic research institute. he was charged with working as a spy for mi6, the british intelligence agency, and reportedly paid more than $2 million, iranian state media reported saturday. he allegedly provided information to foreign officials about 178 iranian figures, including the country's chief nuclear scientist, mohsen fakhrizadeh, who was killed by a remote-controlled machine gun operating out of a car in 2020. iran's top officials accused israel of masterminding the plot at the time, without providing evidence. why it matters: though iran does not recognize dual nationality, the execution of an individual holding british citizenship will likely further fuel tensions between tehran and western nations, which have been critical of the regime's response to anti-government demonstrations that began in september last year. iran has long ranked among the world's top executioners, and akbari is one of three individuals to receive a death sentence in the first weeks of 2023. more than 80,000 turn out for tel aviv protest against netanyahu government despite pouring rain, tens of thousands of people protested in tel aviv saturday night against israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and his government's proposed changes to the judicial system. others took to the streets in jerusalem for parallel protests. attendees held signs comparing netanyahu to russian president vladimir putin, and saying israel was turning into the likes of semi-democratic hungary and theocratic iran. background: the proposed changes, announced last week by israeli justice minister yariv levin, would seek to reform supreme court nominations via a review committee and enable parliament to overturn supreme court rulings. why it matters: protesters told cnn they fear for israel's future and that they came out to send a message to netanyahu that the public wouldn't stand for what they see as the dismantling of israeli democracy. esther hayut, the president of israel's supreme court, on thursday attacked the proposed changes as ""an unbridled attack on the legal system"" and said they were ""designed to force a fatal blow on the independence of the judicial system."" syria sets conditions for rapprochement with turkey syrian foreign minister faisal mekdad said on saturday that turkey would have to end its military presence in his country to achieve a full rapprochement, reuters reported. ""we cannot talk about resuming normal ties with turkey without removing the occupation, without ending terrorism and returning the relations to the state that they were based on the first place,"" he said after meeting his iranian counterpart in damascus. background: turkish foreign minister mevlut cavusoglu said on thursday that he could meet his syrian counterpart early in february. syria has made no official comment on the timing of any such meeting, which would mark the highest-level talks between ankara and damascus since the syrian war began in 2011. why it matters: turkey has been a major backer of the political and armed opposition to syrian president bashar al-assad during the 12-year conflict in syria, and has sent its own troops into swathes of the country's north. but ankara may be seeking a green light from the syrian regime and its russian ally to launch a military operation against kurdish groups in northern syria. $30 billion the uae will invest $30 billion in south korea, reuters cited south korea's presidential office as saying on sunday. the decision was announced as south korea's president yoon suk-yeol met his uae counterpart, sheikh mohammed bin zayed al-nahyan, in abu dhabi during a four-day visit. yoon's press secretary said the investment will be directed at nuclear power, defense, hydrogen and solar energy industries, among others. what's trending saudi arabia: #naturalizing_children_of_female_cit",3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.7423940062522889,0.13071494176983833,0.026891062036156654,-0.8999349635766452,0,0,0,0,-2.6998048907299355,-16.69837274962113,37.0,-0.45130737161138185

Opinion: Don't expect Biden to confront Netanyahu anytime soon,2023-01-04,35.0,"barely a week into the most extreme government in israel's history, its controversial national security minister, itamar ben gvir, is already demonstrating its right-wing religious and nationalist credentials. on tuesday, ben gvir visited the jerusalem compound known as the temple mount by jews and the haram al-sharif by muslims -- an action that threatens to upset an already precarious status quo and trigger violence. ben gvir, who has previously been convicted of racist incitement, has vowed to institutionalize jewish prayer and presence in perhaps the most volatile flashpoint in the israeli-palestinian conflict. his stated intention for the visit was to mark one of the jewish fast days. the visit prompted a string of international condemnations, including from the us embassy in jerusalem, which indicated in a short statement that such actions were ""unacceptable."" ben gvir -- a long time provocateur and heir to the party of the extremist rabbi meir kahane -- is now in charge of israel's police, putting him in an influential position to stir up trouble in jerusalem and between israel's arab and jewish citizens. but if you think the biden administration is gearing up for a sustained campaign to aggressively oppose the direction the new netanyahu government is heading, you should lay down and wait quietly until the feeling passes. governing is about choosing. and while a fight might yet come, us president joe biden will go to great lengths to avoid a confrontation with a newly elected israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu. here's five reasons why. first, biden is preternaturally pro-israel. the us president may have once told netanyahu: ""bibi, i don't agree with a damn thing you say, but i love you."" but it's not the prime minister with whom he's enthralled, it's the state of israel. biden's commitment to israel stretches back decades. he's long been captivated by the idea of israel and has a deep appreciation and respect for the realities of israel's security challenges. if you're looking for a presidential model when it comes to handling israel, it's not biden's former boss barack obama that comes to mind but former president bill clinton. as fellow politicians, their affection for israel and the importance of supporting israel politically run deep. as far as netanyahu is concerned, biden knows all too well the prime minister's strengths and limitations. after the humiliation of a netanyahu government decision to announce a major expansion of housing in east jerusalem during his visit as vice president in 2010, biden clearly doesn't trust him. at the same time, he knows that netanyahu -- for better or worse -- is a political survivor and an immensely talented politician who's been a part of israel's story for decades. biden believes -- perhaps mistakenly -- that if he wants to have any chance of getting anything done in the region, he must find a way to deal with him. like clinton, his first instinct is not to jam netanyahu but to give him the benefit of the doubt and try to work things out quietly without a public row. indeed, it's no coincidence that in congratulating netanyahu on his new government, biden referred to the fact they've been friends for decades. second, biden is too busy. fighting with israel requires presidential time and energy. biden's foreign policy plate is already brimming with problems that lack quick or easy solutions. the administration's top foreign policy priorities are the russian war against ukraine and how to deal with china. and then there are the nuclear threats from both north korea and iran. these are the challenges that will define his presidency far more than the middle east, which the administration has rightly deprioritized. in that region, filled with political and security landmines, the focus is on managing -- not resolving. and trying to keep as many issues off the president's plate as possible. biden got a taste of the risks during his ill-fated ""fist-bump"" trip to saudi arabia in july last year. he gave crown prince mohammed bin salman what he wanted -- recognition. and in return, he essentially got a slap in the face. with gas prices rising, two weeks before the midterms, the saudi-russia dominated opec+ cartel cut production significantly. third, biden knows fighting with israel is bad politics. republicans control the house and trail the democrats by a hair in the senate. the race for the white house won't formally conclude until 2024; but it begins this year. whether biden runs or not, the israel issue is always loaded politically -- for whoever does run. with the exception of a few outliers like sen. rand paul of kentucky, the republican party has set itself up as the go-to party on israel. and given netanyahu's honorary membership in the gop, it should surprise no one if he finds a way, as he did during the obama administration, to cavort with the republicans. if donald trump is the republican nominee, there's no doubt they'll figure out ways to cavort with one another. the last thing biden or any democratic nominee needs is to get sandwiched between the republicans beating him up for fighting with israel, and a democratic party divided between a majority who are traditional israeli supporters and a progressive minority pushing the administration to hold israel accountable for its treatment of the palestinians. in the event the iran nuclear deal surfaces again (even the israelis believe it's not dead yet) biden would get caught between republicans and more than a few democrats who will vigorously oppose us reentry -- and an israeli prime minister egging them on, if not leading the band. fourth, biden knows the palestinian issue isn't ready for prime time. presidents don't willingly seek out fights with a close ally, even one where us interests and values may be beginning to diverge on some important issues. and fighting with israel on the palestinian issue, which shows little promise of producing results, is unlikely to provide biden with much of an incentive. the two-state solution, if not dead and going the way of the dodo, still faces unimaginable long odds. the best biden can possibly hope to achieve is to prevent an explosion between israelis and palestinians of tensions. that involves holding the line against de jure annexation by israel; preempting another escalatory round like may 2021 between israel and hamas and keeping the abraham accord countries from jumping ship if there's a sustained confrontation between israel and the palestinians. the key ingredient required for anything remotely resembling a credible negotiating process are leaders on each side who are willing and able to make key decisions and bring their constituencies along with them. these simply do not exist now. fifth, biden believes iran is the greater priority. the palestinian issue is volatile. but the real crisis for biden isn't over a two-state solution but how to contain iran's nuclear program. that issue could lead to regional confrontation, rising oil prices and plunging financial markets. and right now, it appears that there's little prospect of a return to the nuclear accord even while iran ramps up uranium enrichment to near weapons-grade. biden knows that netanyahu's threshold for taking military action against iran is much lower than america's. and the us president is going to try to coordinate with netanyahu on iran, rather than push him into a corner, in the hopes of finding some way to deter iran without the use of military force. what biden is unlikely to do is to put himself in a situation where he and netanyahu are in conflict on both iran and the palestinians. biden had a ringside seat watching his former boss obama go at it with netanyahu on both; and probably doesn't want to go down that road again. there are reports that the administration is sending national security adviser jake sullivan to israel this month. that suggests biden wants to get ahead of any kind of confrontation with netanyahu and perhaps believes he can work out understandings on some key issues. netanyahu isn't looking for a fight with biden. right now he's more beholden to his extremist coalition than he is to washington. without those partners, netanyahu can't pass the legislation he needs to postpone or nullify his corruption trial. perhaps he believes he can control his extremist ministers. and that's the case he'll make to the administration -- that he needs help in doing so. paradoxically, tough statements from washington might actually help netanyahu do so. but the administration should also understand that words alone aren't enough, particularly if the views of netanyahu's extremist coalition partners turn into actions. without imposing consequences for provocative israeli actions in jerusalem and the west bank, and working to press palestinians to control terror and violence, biden will likely -- before his first term is up -- have yet another crisis to add to an already full plate.",18.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.45416329035328495,0.32407886027875876,0.22175785045449933,-0.23821357980801305,0,0,0,0,-4.287844436544235,-14.80548877560653,41.0,-0.36110948233186657
Israel's rightward shift leaves its new Arab allies in an awkward spot,2023-01-04,36.0,"it was a rare embrace between one of israel's most controversial politicians and an arab ambassador. itamar ben gvir and the united arab emirates' ambassador to israel mohamed al khaja clutched each other's hands in a warm greeting in tel aviv in early december. ""birds of a feather flock together,"" wrote a columnist in israel's left-leaning haaretz newspaper, arguing that the abraham accords, which saw israel gain recognition from four arab states including the uae in 2020, did little to moderate israel's position on the palestinians. ben gvir, he said, was ""a superstar in the uae."" israel on thursday swore in what is likely to be the most right-wing government in its history, led by six-time prime minister benjamin netanyahu. ben gvir, an extremist who has been convicted for supporting terrorism and inciting anti-arab racism, became national security minister. bezalel smotrich, who supports abolishing the palestinian authority and annexing the west bank, became finance minister. both politicians were invited to national day celebrations in december hosted by the uae and bahrain, which were among the nations that normalized relations with israel, along with morocco and sudan in 2020. ""the emirates are here to show that unity equals prosperity,"" al khaja was cited by the times of israel as saying at his country's national day celebration, where he was photographed with ben gvir. ""we will continue to use diplomacy to deepen connections through friendship and mutual respect."" the public embrace of figures that are hated in the arab world -- and are divisive within israel itself -- is a rare gesture on the part of arab states that have normalized relations with israel. egypt and jordan, who recognized israel in 1979 and 1994 respectively, have had what observers have called a ""cold peace"" with israel. in his phone call to congratulate netanyahu on returning as prime minister, egyptian president abdel fattah el-sisi ""emphasized the need to avoid any measures that would lead to tension and complicate the regional situation."" jordan's king abdullah ii warned in a cnn interview last month that his nation was ""prepared"" for conflict should the situation change at jerusalem's al-aqsa mosque, of which he is the custodian. the rightward direction of israeli politics puts israel's new arab partners in an awkward position regarding the palestinian cause, which remains a central issue among arab publics. ""it is awkward not just for us (in the uae), but for everybody, in america, and all over the place,"" abdulkhaleq abdulla, a political science professor in the uae, told cnn. ""it is a dilemma, but the way to deal with it is just to wait and see."" an opinion poll by the washington institute for near east policy in july 2022 showed that support for the abraham accords had dropped in gulf countries to a minority view, including the uae and bahrain, where more than 70% of the public views the agreement negatively. the data however also showed that around 40% of people in saudi arabia, the uae and bahrain support maintaining business and sporting ties with israel. the normalizing states appear to be cognizant of that. on friday, all four arab states continued the tradition of supporting the palestinians at the united nations by voting at the general assembly to seek the international criminal court's opinion on the legal consequences of israel's occupation of palestinian territories. netanyahu called the vote ""despicable."" but israeli media has reported that behind the scenes, the emiratis have also been sending messages of concern to netanyahu about the inclusion of extremists in his government. ahead of the israeli elections, uae foreign minister abdullah bin zayed warned netanyahu against including ben gvir and smotrich in his government, the times of israel reported, citing a senior official. axios, which first reported the news, said netanyahu didn't respond. the move would be a rare case of one of israel's arab partners showing a preference for the country's domestic politics. the uae foreign ministry didn't respond to cnn's request for comment. israeli analyst zvi bar'el wrote in haaretz that the december move to embrace ben gvir may have been linked to abu dhabi's desire to steer israeli policy, adding that it made the uae ""the arab country with the greatest influence on the new israeli government."" the effectiveness of the uae's diplomacy within israel remains to be seen. so far, israel's extremist minister seems unrestrained. less than a week since he was sworn in, ben gvir made a controversial visit to the al-aqsa mosque compound escorted by israeli police on tuesday. the mosque, which lies in israeli-occupied east jerusalem, is in an area known to muslims as haram al-sharif. it is the third holiest site for muslims and the holiest for jews, who know it as the temple mount. under current arrangements, non-muslims aren't allowed to pray there and ben gvir wants to change that. the uae ""strongly"" condemned ben gvir's visit without naming the minister, and called for the need to respect jordan's custodianship of the holy site. it later joined china in calling for an urgent meeting of the un security council on the matter. ""however unhappy they (bahrain and the uae) might be towards the emergence of israel's most right-wing government, it's clear that they've chosen to air these concerns privately, and have stopped short of letting them stand in the way of what they see as an important strategic relationship,"" elham fakhro, a research fellow at the centre for gulf studies at the university of exeter, england, told cnn. but the uae has said earlier that the more friendly ties with the arab world weren't a green light for israel to expand its territory. in june 2020, yousef al otaiba, the uae ambassador to the united states, warned israel that its relations with arab nations would suffer if there is any ""illegal seizure of palestinian land."" abdullah, the professor from the uae, said that abu dhabi may have some leverage over israel that it may use privately at times, but added that ultimately ""everybody knows that nobody today has any leverage over israel. even america."" still, the uae-israel relationship is not everlasting, he said. ""this relationship is going to be dictated by the uae... when it doesn't serve the interest of the uae... it can collapse at any time."" with additional reporting by nadeen ebrahim the digest turkey's ruling party mulls bringing elections 'slightly' forward turkish president tayyip erdogan's ruling ak party is considering a ""slight change"" on the date of elections scheduled for mid-june, reuters cited ak party spokesman omer celik as saying on monday. since the date of the elections corresponds with the summer holiday season, the party is evaluating bringing it ""slightly forward,"" he said. background: turkey's parliamentary and presidential elections are scheduled to be held on june 18, and erdogan previously said elections would be held in june. the date change would not amount to snap elections, celik said. why it matters: the elections are set to take place as turkey faces soaring inflation and an economic downturn that could hurt erdogan's prospects for re-election. but the government has of late tried to win back voter support through populist moves including wage hikes, retirement benefits, social aid, energy and agriculture support. amnesty condemns iran for upholding protester death sentence amnesty international on monday condemned the iranian supreme court's decision to uphold the death sentence of protester mohammad boroughani, who according to iranian state media is accused of stabbing a security guard during a protest. background: boroughani will be executed under the ""moharebeh law,"" or waging war against god, the state-aligned tasnim news agency said. prior to the supreme court's confirmation of the sentence, he was sentenced to death by a revolutionary court during a group trial in tehran presided by notorious judge abolghasem salavati, amnesty said. why it matters: the protester is among 26 others identified by amnesty last month as being at risk of execution in connection to the country's nationwide protests. iran has already carried out two protest-related executions over the past months of unrest. cnn has verified that at least 43 detainees are facing execution. the situation has drawn strong criticism from several european countries, including germany, france and britain. iran's judiciary indicts two french nationals and a belgian for espionage iran has indicted two french nationals and a belgian for espionage and working against the country's national security, reuters reported, citing the semi-official student news network on tuesday. the agency did not give the names of the three or say where or when they were indicted. background: belgium's justice minister said last month that belgian aid worker olivier vandecasteele had been sentenced to 28 years in prison in iran for what he called a ""fabricated series of crimes."" iranian media aired a video in october in which two french citizens appeared to confess to spying. the video sparked outrage in france, which said the detainees were ""state hostages."" why it matters: a total of seven french citizens are being held in iran, france's foreign minister said in november. iran has accused foreign adversaries of fomenting the wave of unrest that erupted three months ago. the protests mark one of the boldest challenges to the country's leadership since its 1979 islamic revolution and have drawn in iranians from all walks of life. what's trending regional: #halaronaldo (hello, ronaldo) soccer fans in saudi arabia and other gulf states are celebrating the arrival of famed portuguese forward cristiano ronaldo in riyadh, who touched down in the kingdom on tuesday ahead of his unveiling ceremony with the al nassr football club. twitter was flooded with images of ronaldo wearing the club's yellow and blue colors, smiling on large billboards in the saudi capital. memes showed ""sheikh ronaldo"" dressed in arab attire, and another showed him wearing a jersey with the ""just do it"" slogan for his sponsor nike crossed out and replaced with ""inshallah"" -- god-willing in arabic. a magazine in saudi arabia even put out ads for a full-time ""ronaldo correspondent,"" esquire magazine reported.

Israel's far-right Ben Gvir visits flashpoint Jerusalem holy site as Palestinians slam 'provocation',2023-01-03,37.0,"israel's far-right national security minister itamar ben gvir on tuesday visited the jerusalem compound known as the temple mount by jews and the haram al-sharif or noble sanctuary by muslims, in a move that drew international condemnation. videos published on israeli media showed ben gvir walking through the compound surrounded by israeli police. tensions are high over the flashpoint complex, which is the holiest site in judaism and the third holiest in islam. it contains the al-aqsa mosque and the site of the destroyed first and second jewish temples. only muslims are allowed to pray at the complex under a decades-old agreement; ben gvir believes that jews should have the right to pray there, too. palestinians immediately objected to the visit. ""we strongly condemn extremist ben gvir's storming of the blessed al-aqsa mosque, and we consider it an unprecedented provocation and a serious threat,"" the palestinian foreign ministry said in a statement. ""we hold (israeli prime minister benjamin) netanyahu responsible for its consequences on the conflict and the region."" ben gvir entered the compound on tuesday but not the al-aqsa mosque building itself. the lawmaker's visit was his first since he was sworn in last week as national security minister, in what is set to be the most right-wing government in israel's history. it is led by netanyahu, who has returned for his sixth term as prime minister at the head of a coalition that includes several extremist parties. ben gvir, the leader of the far-right jewish power (otzma yehudit) party, has previously been convicted for supporting terrorism and inciting anti-arab racism. as national security minister, he oversees police in israel as well as some police activity in the occupied west bank. hamas, the palestinian militant group that runs gaza, warned that ben gvir's visit would be a ""precursor for the ignition of the region"" and it will be ""pouring fuel over fire."" ""the israeli government of which i am a member will not surrender to a vile murdering organization,"" ben gvir responded in a tweet. ""the temple mount is open to everyone and if hamas thinks that if it threatens me it will deter me, let them understand that times have changed. there is a government in jerusalem!"" under the so-called status quo agreement dating back to ottoman rule of jerusalem, only muslims are allowed to pray inside the al-aqsa mosque compound, and non-muslims are allowed to visit the complex only at certain times. israel and other states agreed to maintain status quo access to these holy sites after israel captured them in the 1967 war. some religious nationalist jewish groups have been demanding access to the temple mount area for jewish prayer. there have been several instances of jewish visitors conducting prayers on the compound, sparking outrage from muslim authorities and forced removals by israeli police. visits by israeli political figures have historically preceded periods of violence between israel and palestinians. the conservative israeli opposition leader ariel sharon's visit to the complex in september 2000 contributed to the start of the second intifada, a yearslong palestinian uprising against israel. 'people will die' former israeli prime minister yair lapid criticized netanyahu over the visit, calling him ""weak"" for entrusting the ""most irresponsible man in the middle east to the most explosive place in the middle east."" in a tweet, lapid called the visit a ""provocation that will lead to violence that will endanger human life and cost human lives,"" and said that it's time for netanyahu to tell ben gvir, ""you don't go up to the temple mount because people will die."" the visit also drew a chorus of international criticism. the uae ""strongly condemned the storming of al-aqsa mosque courtyard by an israeli minister under the protection of israeli forces,"" in a statement without mentioning ben gvir by name. the gulf nation has been attempting to maintain its support for the palestinians while balancing its newly formed partnership with israel. the country has issued past condemnations, particularly over events that raise tension over the holy sites in jerusalem. egypt's foreign ministry ""warned of the negative repercussions of such measures on security and stability"" and called ""on all parties to exercise restraint and responsibility and refrain from any measures that would inflame the situation."" jordan condemned ben gvir's visit in the ""strongest"" terms, calling it ""a flagrant and unacceptable violation of international law, and of the historical and legal status quo in jerusalem and its sanctities."" jordan's monarchy has been the custodian of jerusalem's holy sites since 1924 and sees itself as the guarantor of the religious rights of muslims and christians in the city. the 57-member organisation of islamic cooperation also issued a statement holding israel responsible for the repercussions of ""aggression"" against palestinian people. a us embassy spokesperson said: ""ambassador (tom) nides has been very clear in conversations with the israeli government on the issue of preserving the status quo in jerusalem's holy sites. actions that prevent that are unacceptable."" the british consulate in jerusalem said in a statement on facebook that it was ""concerned"" by ben gvir's visit and said it ""remains committed to the status quo."" in a tweet about the site tuesday evening, germany's ambassador to israel, steffen seibert, warned against ""actions that could increase tensions."" the leader of the iran-backed lebanese militant group hezbollah said the visit will not only cause unrest in palestinian territories ""but may ignite the entire region."" in a televised speech tuesday, hassan nasrallah also stated hezbollah doesn't fear israel's new right-wing government. ""it's composed of freaks and crazy people,"" he said. netanyahu insisted tuesday that his government was not seeking to change the rules at the site. ""prime minister benjamin netanyahu is committed to strictly maintaining the status quo, without changes, on the temple mount,"" a statement from his office said. ""we will not be dictated to by hamas. under the status quo, ministers have gone up to the temple mount in recent years, including public security minister gilad erdan; therefore, the claim that a change has been made in the status quo is without foundation.""",6.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.348232699247698,0.3051028986616681,0.34666441520676017,0.1199091518565434,0,0,0,0,0.7194549111392604,-9.629525613389646,36.0,-0.26748682259415685
Four things to watch out for in the Middle East in 2023,2023-01-02,38.0,"the event that dominated the world's news agenda in 2022 was the ukraine war and its far-reaching repercussions. its impact was felt deeply in the middle east, with the region's energy supplies, strategic waterways, and even weapons industries playing a key role in the war. last year saw adversaries of the west strengthening ties with middle eastern states, sometimes at the west's expense. gulf arab states, keen to remain neutral in what they saw as a world order moving towards multipolarity, found themselves in an awkward position with their traditional allies in the west when asked to choose sides in the ukraine war. the war also -- perhaps inadvertently -- pushed arab oil producers closer to russia at the opec oil cartel, inviting the united states' wrath. and as china's relations with the us frayed, they continued to strengthen with saudi arabia. but even as the middle east's ties with the west fluctuated, its relevance remained intact and perhaps even grew. europe increasingly looked to the region for energy security. qatar, which hosted the 2022 world cup, is set to become an even more significant gas supplier to europe in the coming years. meanwhile, two middle eastern neighbors, iran and turkey, supplied opposing sides of the war in ukraine with drones that had a significant impact on the battlefield. the war saw ankara's international prominence grow, whether through its attempts to mediate between the warring parties or its grandstanding at nato that stalled the alliance's expansion. all that gave a domestic boost to president recep tayyip erdogan as turkey's economy reeled from an inflation-driven downturn. here's what to watch out for in the middle east in 2023: erdogan's grip on power may be tested as turkey celebrates its centennial president erdogan had set an ambitious set of goals for his nation in its centennial. but as the turkish republic celebrates its hundredth year in 2023, erdogan may find himself focused instead on trying to hold on to his seat. the turkish lira has been plummeting in value for four years and the cost of living has been skyrocketing as a result of erdogan's unorthodox and widely criticized monetary policies that have shied away from raising interest rates to curb inflation. coupled with years of governance fatigue and a new generation of voters who are looking for change, 2023 could potentially mark the decline of erdogan's grip on power. elections, which are expected to take place in early summer, had dominated turkey's domestic agenda for much of last year. for the first time in years, the opposition -- at least for now -- seems united around fielding a candidate that could unseat erdogan. last year saw the president suffer a major setback in opinion polls, with his approval rate slipping. the presidential system, engineered and implemented by erdogan himself, requires a 50% plus 1 majority in elections -- a tough proposition for the leader as the economy slows. on the international front, the key nato ally continues to struggle through its uneasy alliance with the us and europe. the us' ongoing support for an armed kurdish group in syria that turkey views as a national threat and a cold personal relationship between erdogan and us president joe biden underscore the tense relationship. unresolved disputes with greece over sea borders in the mediterranean as well as a war of words over a greek military deployment in small aegean islands close to turkey continue to raise tensions with europe. whether or not the relationship with europe can grow beyond cooperation over keeping migrants and refugees confined to turkey will depend on finding common ground. when it comes to ukraine, the turkish position, regardless of who is victorious in the elections, will remain largely unchanged. the policy of ""pro-ukrainian neutrality,"" as it is called locally, has paid off with a globally impactful grain deal and has kept the turkish economy from taking further blows. by gul tuysuz israel's lurch to the right israel has a new government, and although it's led by a familiar face -- benjamin netanyahu -- it is made up of some of the most extreme right-wing figures to hold ministerial positions in israeli history. especially of note are itamar ben gvir, national security minister in charge of israeli police, and bezalel smotrich, finance minister who will have a say in the policies that affect the movement of palestinians in the occupied west bank. both are right-wing settler-lawyers turned politicians who were once considered the far fringe of israeli politics. these ministers are setting off alarm bells for many in the international community, including the united states, who are concerned their actions could further deteriorate the security situation on the ground. ben gvir and his ilk have openly talked about changing the status quo at jerusalem's holiest site -- known as temple mount to jews and haram al-sharif to muslims -- where only muslims are permitted to pray. but actions in the compound in the past have sparked an uprising and even a war. then there's the west bank, where smotrich will have a big hand in determining policy. last year was the deadliest for both palestinians and israelis in decades. security cooperation between the israeli military and the palestinian security forces, which has long been seen by israeli leaders as a key to keeping the west bank calm, was already strained last year. netanyahu has always run his governments as a one-man show, often de facto taking on such roles as that of the foreign minister. in recent interviews, he has repeatedly claimed that he and his likud party will dictate policy. but allies, like major jewish figures in the us, are concerned netanyahu has built something he won't be able to fully control. one of the biggest questions is how the biden administration will work with the israeli government -- and if it will even interact with the two controversial ministers. so far, the us is taking a wait-and-see approach, with secretary of state antony blinken saying in december that the us will judge the israeli government ""by the policies it pursues rather than individual personalities."" by hadas gold a more cohesive opec+ when the opec+ cartel of oil-exporting nations including saudi arabia and russia decided in october to cut production by two million barrels a day, it was seen by observers as a political gamble on the part of riyadh, the group's de facto leader. the larger-than-usual cut was interpreted in the us as an attempt to raise oil prices ahead of midterm elections as the west tried to choke off the russian oil revenues that were funding the war. but just weeks after the cuts, oil prices dropped to pre-war levels amid concerns about a looming global recession and a slow chinese exit from covid-19 lockdowns. the drop prompted saudi energy minister prince abdulaziz bin salman to reiterate that the cartel's decision was right and not politically driven. that price drop created confidence in the prince's guidance of the group, said amena bakr, chief opec correspondent at energy intelligence, an energy information company. ""i expect 2023 to be a year where opec+ remains very much united,"" she said, adding that a globally isolated russia needs the alliance and is likely to go along with the group's decisions. an uncertainty that may persist into 2023, however, is how the price caps imposed by western nations on russian oil in december may affect the market and in turn the price of global oil. as a result, russia has said that it may cut production by up to 700,000 barrels a day. but energy intelligence predicts that russian crude and condensate production could drop by as much as 1.2 million barrels a day, said bakr. that's over 1% of the global supply. if a gap emerges in the market, the cartel could even consider adding more barrels, she said. gulf states are also likely to become important providers of gas to europe as it weans itself off russian supplies. qatar signed its first gas agreement with germany in 2022 and another one with france, while neighboring uae also signed gas deals with germany and austria. the country has also been touted by european officials as a future exporter of renewables to europe. by abbas al lawati an increasingly isolated iran as the international community was consumed by iran's regional ambitions and the never-ending nuclear negotiation last year, an entire generation of repressed women at home shook the foundations of the islamic republic. after 22-year-old mahsa jina amini died while in the custody of the nation's notorious morality police, the government found itself facing protesters in the streets of almost every major city in one of the strongest challenges to the islamic republic since the 1979 revolution that brought it to power. those protests, and iran's support for russia's invasion of ukraine, further complicated tehran's relations with the west, making an elusive nuclear agreement even more difficult to achieve. how the protests play out could dictate the course of the islamic republic's domestic, regional and foreign relations in 2023. the momentum of the protests has slowed, and while the government actively works on a deterrence strategy, it is clear that a barrier of fear has been broken. but if domestic woes were not enough for the islamic republic, it is now also dealing with shifting international geopolitics, including a burgeoning chinese-saudi partnership and a russian ally that is now completely embroiled in a protracted war. the continuation of crippling western sanctions on iran has pushed it further east to china, its biggest trade partner. in 2021, a 25-year strategic ""cooperation"" pact worth $400 billion of investment deals was signed between the two nations. but as saudi arabia and iran remain diplomatic enemies, and as saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman warms up to xi amid a saudi quarrel with biden over opec, the developing china-saudi relationship, and its effect on the islamic republic, is one to watch in 2023. regionally, iran's archenemy, benjamin netanyahu, is back in power in israel, with his attention firmly on tehran's nuclear program. with an ailing supreme leader, iran's leadership could be looking to firm up his successor, and as the elite quds force mourns the third anniversary of the loss of its leader qassem soleimani, iraq's attempts to break away from iran's influence also remains a challenge for tehran. by mostafa salem the digest iran police detain top-tier soccer players in raid on party iranian police briefly detained several unidentified top-tier soccer players in a raid on a party on new year's eve where alcohol was served in violation of an islamic ban, reuters cited iranian media as saying. the semi-official news agency tasnim said several current players and form",4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.6434087897149416,0.19944253965245132,0.14945636733005255,-0.779105355698107,0,0,0,0,-3.116421422792428,-10.046142145452137,37.0,-0.2715173552824902
Benjamin Netanyahu sworn in as leader of Israel's likely most right-wing government ever,2022-12-29,39.0,"benjamin netanyahu thursday completed a dramatic return as israel's prime minister, after being sworn in as the leader of what is likely to be the country's most right-wing government in history. netanyahu and his government were sworn in on thursday for his sixth term as prime minister, 18 months after he was ousted from power. he returns with the support of several far-right figures once consigned to the fringes of israeli politics, after cobbling together a coalition shortly before last week's deadline. members of netanyahu's likud party will fill some of the most important cabinet positions, including foreign minister, defense minister and justice minister. but a number of politicians from the far right of israel's political spectrum were set to be appointed to ministerial posts, despite controversy over their positions during the run-up to november's election, which was won by a netanyahu-led bloc of ultra-nationalist and ultra-religious parties. itamar ben gvir, an extremist who has been convicted for supporting terrorism and inciting anti-arab racism, will take on a newly expanded public security role, renamed national security minister, overseeing police in israel plus some police activity in the occupied west bank. bezalel smotrich, leader of the religious zionism party, has been named minister of finance, and has also been given power to appoint the head of the coordinator of government activities in the territories (cogat), an israeli military unit which among its duties handles border crossings and permits for palestinians. during his campaign, smotrich had proposed a series of drastic legal reforms, seen by many critics as a clear way to undercut judicial independence. this includes dropping the ability to charge a public servant with fraud and breach of trust -- a charge netanyahu faces in his ongoing corruption trial. netanyahu has pleaded not guilty and called that trial a ""witch hunt"" and an ""attempted coup,"" and has called for changes to israel's judiciary system. aryeh deri, leader of the ultra-orthodox sephardi party shas, will serve as interior minister and minister of health. as the new ministers were preparing to be sworn in at the knesset, the country's parliament, around 2,000 demonstrators gathered outside to protest netanyahu's return to office, the jerusalem police spokesperson said. the rightward shift in the israeli government has raised eyebrows abroad and at home. on wednesday, over 100 retired israeli ambassadors and foreign ministry officials expressed concerns about israel's incoming government in a signed letter to netanyahu. the ex-diplomats, including former ambassadors to france, india, and turkey, expressed ""profound concern at the serious damage to israel's foreign relations, its international standing and its core interests abroad emanating from what will apparently be the policy of the incoming government."" the letter pointed to ""statements made by potential senior office-holders in the government and the knesset,"" reports of policy changes in the west bank, and ""some possible extreme and discriminatory laws"" as a point of concern. us ambassador to israel tom nides congratulated netanyahu on thursday, writing on twitter: ""here's to the rock solid us-israel relationship and unbreakable ties."" nides is married to virginia moseley, cnn us executive vice president for editorial. a national security council spokesperson noted netanyahu has ""repeatedly said he will set the policy of his government"" as he enters a coalition with far-right parties. ""as we have made clear, we do not support policies that endanger the viability of a two-state solution or contradict our mutual interests and values,"" the spokesperson said. biden administration officials have largely avoided addressing the ultra-right components of the new israeli government. secretary of state antony blinken said last week that the us ""will engage with and judge our partners in israel on the basis of the policies they pursue, not the personalities that happen to form the government."" netanyahu's slim november victory came in the fifth israeli election in less than four years, amid a period of protracted political chaos during which he has remained a dominant figure. in his address to the knesset on thursday, netanyahu said that of the three major tasks assigned to his government, the first will be to ""thwart iran's efforts to obtain nuclear weapons."" the second priority would be to develop the country's infrastructure, including the launching of a bullet train and the third would be to sign more peace agreements with arab nations ""in order to end the israeli-arab conflict."" netanyahu was already israel's longest-serving prime minister, having previously held the post from 2009 to 2021 and before that for one term in the late 1990s. israel also got its first openly gay speaker of parliament on thursday. amir ohana, a former minister of justice and public security, is a member of the knesset representing netanyahu's likud party. some ultra-orthodox lawmakers who had refused to attend his swearing-in at the knesset seven years ago were among those who voted for him on thursday. ahead of the parliamentary vote on the new government, outgoing prime minister yair lapid tweeted: ""we pass on to you a state in excellent condition. try not to ruin it, we'll be right back. the handover files are ready."" with additional reporting by kareem el damanhoury ",14.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.33083850158644573,0.3384371217606323,0.33072437946352046,0.0021153197560266545,0,0,0,0,0.02961447658437316,-7.154275346413181,48.0,-0.1490474030502746
Jordan king warns of 'red lines' in Jerusalem as Netanyahu returns to office,2022-12-28,40.0,"jordan's king says he is prepared for conflict should the status of jerusalem's holy sites change as israel prepares to swear in what is likely to be the most right-wing government in its history. king abdullah ii told cnn's becky anderson in an exclusive interview this month that there is ""concern"" in his country about those in israel trying to push for changes to his custodianship of the muslim and christian holy sites in israeli-occupied east jerusalem, warning that he has ""red lines."" ""if people want to get into a conflict with us, we're quite prepared,"" he said. ""i always like to believe that, let's look at the glass half full, but we have certain red lines... and if people want to push those red lines, then we will deal with that."" israeli leader benjamin netanyahu's incoming government is expected to be the most right-wing in israel's history and it includes controversial figures who were once considered to be on the extreme fringe of israeli politics. this has caused concerns about the potential for an escalation in israeli-palestinian violence and for the future of israel's relations with its arab neighbors and western allies. this year was already the deadliest for palestinians and israelis in nearly two decades, raising the specter of a new palestinian uprising against israel. ""we have to be concerned about a next intifada (uprising),"" said the king. ""and if that happens, that's a complete breakdown of law and order and one that neither the israelis nor the palestinians will benefit from. i think there is a lot of concern from all of us in the region, including those in israel that are on our side on this issue, to make sure that doesn't happen."" israel captured east jerusalem from jordan in the 1967 war but signed a peace treaty with it in 1994 under which it formally recognized amman's special role at the city's holy sites. but the two have since had an uneasy relationship, with jordan regularly accusing israel of violating the agreement that gave it control of the sites and barred non-muslims from praying there. jordan's hashemite monarchy has been the custodian of jerusalem's holy sites since 1924 and sees itself as the guarantor of the religious rights of muslims and christians in the city. tensions are highest over the compound known to muslims as the haram al sharif, which is called the temple mount by jews. the site includes the al aqsa mosque, the third holiest site in islam. the area is also the holiest site in judaism. politicians on the israeli right often argue that jews should also have a right to pray there. one of the most controversial figures in israel's incoming government is itamar ben gvir, who is set to become the national security minister and assume control over the police, including law enforcement at jerusalem's holy sites. ben gvir has a long history of inciting violence against palestinians and arabs. he has been convicted of inciting anti-arab racism and supporting terrorism and has openly called for changing the status quo at the holy sites. ""i don't think those individuals are under just a jordanian microscope. they're under an international microscope,"" the king said, responding to a question about ben gvir's views. ""i have to believe that there's a lot of people in israel also that are concerned as much as we are."" he refused to say how jordan would respond to changes in the status of the holy sites. ""at the end of the day, the israeli people have the right to pick whoever they want to lead them... we will work with anybody and everybody as long as we can bring people together,"" he said. of jordan's population of around 10 million, more than half is of palestinian descent, including more than two million palestinian refugees. jordan was the second arab nation to normalize relations with israel, after egypt. but after a decades-long wait, israel scored a major diplomatic victory in 2020 by gaining recognition from four more arab states, the united arab emirates, bahrain, morocco and sudan. the nation's relationship with israel is heavily scrutinized at home, with many opposing further strengthening of ties due to israel's treatment of the palestinians. israel's integration into the region is ""extremely important"" but it is ""not going to happen unless there's a future for the palestinians,"" the king said, pointing to the overwhelming support shown by arab football fans for palestinians at the qatar fifa world cup. the king has redoubled efforts to shed light on the status of christians in the middle east of late. in september, he proclaimed at the united nations general assembly in new york that christianity in jerusalem was ""under fire,"" a message the patriarchs and heads of the churches in jerusalem endorsed. some churches in the holy land have also been sounding the alarm about the status of christians there. in a christmas message this week, the heads of churches in jerusalem, a grouping of palestinian churches, issued a statement decrying the ""assault"" on their exercise of religion and ""unwarranted restrictions"" on worship. in july, the higher presidential committee of church affairs in palestine issued a statement condemning an attack by ""extremist israeli settlers"" on the church of the holy spirit and the greek garden, accusing the israeli government of complicity through ""inaction"" in holding the perpetrators to account. israeli foreign ministry spokesman lior haiat told cnn the heads of churches ""have full access to every governmental authority for concerns they have,"" adding that acts of violence ""on any community are condemned by the government and investigated with the utmost seriousness by israeli police."" ""the state of israel remains committed to safeguarding freedom of religion and worship for all, including the christian community, in jerusalem and other holy sites,"" he said. king abdullah told cnn that churches in jerusalem face challenges from ""policies on the ground,"" causing the christian community to come under pressure. ""this is not a national policy, but there are those that join governments that have very extremist views towards muslims and christians, as there are on the other side obviously, and we have to unify against that,"" he said. christians in the middle east are ""part of our past, they're part of our present, and they must be part of our future,"" he added. jordan has become a safe haven for middle eastern christians for the better part of the past two decades as neighboring countries have been embroiled in conflicts that have pushed some of the oldest christian communities in the world to flee their homelands. in december, the monarch launched a master plan to develop bethany beyond the jordan, a unesco world heritage site where christians believe jesus was baptized. the plan aims to build lodging, museums and amphitheatres catering to as many as 1.5 million tourists per year. ""i think one of the things that people misunderstand about this place is how inclusive it is. almost 15% of the visitors that come here are muslim,"" he told cnn. ""so this is an opportunity to break down those barriers and to show how proud we are of not only our historical christian heritage here in jordan, but the relationship between christianity and islam."" people in the middle east ""just want to move on with their lives,"" said the monarch. ""so, as challenging as 2022 was, and as difficult as the dangers of 2023 are, there's an opportunity for us to move beyond."" that can be done through regional integration, he said. ""i've gotten away from the feeling that politics are going to solve our problems. it's economic dependency,"" he said. ""when i am invested in your success because your success is my success, at the end of the day means we can move forward."" with additional reporting by cnn's mike schwartz in jerusalem.

"December 22, 2022 Russia-Ukraine news",2022-12-21,41.0,"our live coverage of russia's war in ukraine has moved here. russian president vladimir putin said the word ""war"" on thursday while talking to reporters about the fighting in ukraine. the former kgb officer, who chooses his words carefully, has often referred to the war in ukraine as a ""special military operation."" ""our goal is not to spin the flywheel of military conflict, but, on the contrary, to end this war,"" putin told reporters in moscow after attending a state council meeting on youth policy. ""we have been and will continue to strive for this,"" he continued. after attending the meeting, putin took questions from reporters on various topics, including the fighting in ukraine, the us shipment of a patriot missile defense system to ukraine and the russian economy. the head of therussian mercenary group wagner,yevgenyprigozhin, said thursday claims by the united states that his group took weapons deliveries from north korea are ""nothing more than gossip and speculation."" ""everyone knows that it's been a long time since north korea has supplied weapons to the russian federation,""prigozhin said in a statement published on his telegram channel. ""and no other such attempts have even been made. therefore, these arms deliveries from the dprk are nothing more than gossip and speculation."" ""on our behalf, i want to stress that - and i've already answered this question today - we buy quite a lot of american weapons. and that is why my lawyers will more than likely take an active part in the process to lift the u.s. sanctions on the supply of weapons to the wagner pmc,"" he said. ""we believe these restrictions are completely unfair, due to the fact that wagner pmc has never violated international trade rules when buying the us weapons,""prigozhin said. ""unfortunately, mr. kirby makes a lot of statements based on speculation,""prigozhinsaid in response to remarks bythe strategic communications coordinator at the us national security counciljohn

blaming supply chain issues. but the kremlin has also stepped up pressure on those who dare to complain – and is increasingly framing the invasion of ukraine as a patriotic and almost existential cause. local campaigns are raising funds for soldiers in both russia and the self-declared donetsk people’s republic (dpr) in eastern ukraine. one, dubbed “together is warmer,” has raised 3 million rubles (about $45,000) to provide basic equipment and clothing for russian soldiers. a telegram channel detailed last month how citizens helped supply the dpr’s 6th motorized rifles, a company of 74 men. the channel listed what the citizens bought: uniforms, thermal underwear, socks, hats, balaclavas, sweaters, berets, a generator, power banks, medicines, clothes, boots and even two wheelchairs, which the company took to the hospital. in the chuvashia region, where the mobilization prompted protests in the fall, telegram channels said that families had gone into debt buying equipment. “from officials there, all they got was parting words and three sacks of potatoes,” one said. many of the public crowdfunding appeals focus on preventing hypothermia among soldiers fighting without adequate clothing and shelter in sub-zero temperatures. in the central russian city of tambov, for example, 8th grade schoolchildren raised money for socks for the troops. but some also try to source thermal imagery devices, two-way radios, body armor or even drones. maxim samorukov, a fellow at the carnegie endowment for international peace, wrotein foreign policy magazinelast week: “ordinary russians are expected to help their friends and relatives who have had the misfortune of being drafted. indeed, they have little option but to cover the deficiencies in state provisions out of their own pockets simply to protect their loved ones.” read more on the russian supply issues —and moscow's official response —here. in his address on capitol hill wednesday evening, ukrainian presidentvolodymyr zelensky thrust the frontline city of bakhmut onto the world stage, describing the situation there in moving terms. in a roughly 25-minute speech, six minutes were dedicated to the situation in and around the city. members of congress stood and applauded four times as zelensky recounted bakhmut's fate. here's why the city has become a rallying point for ukrainian fortitude: months of fierce fighting: bakhmut rests in the gentle rolling hillocks of ukraine's eastern donbas region. it lies on the road to the much bigger and more strategically important cities of sloviansk and kramatorsk. during the past 10 months of russia’s war on ukraine, the city has risen to infamy. it's regularly referred to as the most contested and kinetic area of the conflict. zelensky's advisers and generals have called the battles for bakhmut “fierce,” “hot” and “difficult.” the fire and brimstone unleashed by the russian advance has left it in ruins, a smoking shell of its former self. this fate has burnished bakhmut’s power as a symbol of ukrainian resistance. in the face of devastating russian attacks, it is still holding on. on the ground in bakhmut: various cnn teams have visited the city in recent months. they witnessed the devastation and dereliction. they saw firsthand the impact it was having on the ukrainian soldiers there, and the shellshock affecting the hardy residents who remained. despite all that, ukraine has held off moscow's troops from overtaking the city, allowing kyiv to fortify important surrounding cities and lessening the blow if russia ever does prevail there. in the meantime, bakhmut has become more than just a city fighting for survival – it is now the beating heart and one of the most powerful emblems of the country’s resistance. read shukla's full report here. us secretary of state antonyblinkensaid he discussed kyiv's peace proposal with his group of seven colleagues this morning after ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky’s visit to washington. “i can just tell you that we’re looking at what he’s put forward. i was just on the —the video with our g7 partners this morning. and this is one of the things that we talked about,”blinkentold cnn’s kylie atwood. blinkencalled zelensky’s peace proposals “a good start.” “they’re things that everyone should be able to, in one way or another, to rally to,” he said. blinkenwould not say how long it would take for the us and ukraine to evaluate the plan together.national security council spokesperson john kirby said the two sides agreed to reviewing the plan yesterday in the meeting between us president joe biden and zelensky. what borders would ukraine accept in a peace deal? blinken said the us and ukraine agreed on the overall peace effort underway. he did not respond more directly to a question of whether kyiv would accept a goal of reclaiming territory up to its borders before the feb. 24 invasion. blinken has previously said that's the us focus, while zelensky has outlined broader visions for retaking the crimean peninsula that russia annexed in 2014. “what’s clear from all of our conversations with ukraine, including the conversations just yesterday between president biden and president zelensky, is that we have the same objectives, the same goals: a free and independent, a prosperous, a democratic ukraine, one that demonstrates that the principles of the united nations charter are being upheld, including on territorial integrity and sovereignty and independence, and that’s something the president reiterated yesterday,”blinkensaid. blinkensaid ukraine has told the us that it is currently focused on taking back its eastern and southern territory that has been occupied since february. “but that doesn’t prejudge in any way where this goes, where it settles,” saidblinkenat his year-end news conference, emphasizing that it would be up to ukraine to decide what a “just and durable” peace looks like. blinkenalso reiterated that russia has shown “no meaningful interest” in diplomacy to end the war. for his part, russian president vladimir putin said thursday that his administration has always been open to talks and that ""it was the ukrainian leadership that refused itself to conduct negotiations.” us president joe biden's administration rolled out new sanctions on10 russian naval entitiesafter

""he spoke the truth, he said what he wanted, what he had to say, i admire that."" ##catch up## republican sen. lindsey graham’s amendment related to seized russian oligarch’s assets and transferring them to the people of ukraine passed by voice vote. it’s the fourth amendment to be approved thursday to the us government funding bill. “this amendment would allow the department of justice through the secretary of state to transfer proceeds from seized oligarch’s assets or other sanctioned entities to the people of ukraine,” graham said. “it will be a god send to the long suffering people of the ukraine. it will be a relief to the american taxpayer… it will be a bad day for oligarchs.” the us has trained approximately 3,100 ukrainian troops to date on different systems, with training on the newly announced patriot missile systems set to begin “very soon,” a senior defense official said. nearly half of those troops have been trained on m777 howitzers or himars rocket launchers, two of the systems that have been critical to ukrainian operations so far. ukrainian forces have also been trained on vehicles, various forms of artillery, drones and other systems. the pentagon will soon begin training ukrainian personnel on how to operate and maintain the patriot missile system, officially announced yesterday during president volodymyr zelensky’s visit to washington. though the pentagon would not specify exactly when the training would begin or how long it would take for ukrainians to master the complex system, a senior defense official said wednesday it would start “very soon” and would take “several months.” the patriot system costs between $450 and $550 million, the pentagon said, depending on the configuration of the platform. each missile costs approximately $4 million. the us will also soon start an expanded training program for ukrainian forces, including joint maneuver and combined arms training. this program will train approximately 500 soldiers per month on larger combat operations. newly downgraded us intelligence suggests the russian mercenary group wagner has assumed expanded influence and is recruiting convicts — including some with serious medical conditions — from prisons to supplement moscow’s flagging military. the group recently took delivery of arms from north korea, a top us official said, a sign of its growing role in the war in ukraine. and the us believes wagner could be locked in a power battle with the russian military itself as it jockeys for influence with the kremlin. “in certain instances, russian military officials are actually subordinate to wagner's command,” said john kirby, the strategic communications coordinator at the national security council. “it's pretty apparent to us that wagner is emerging as a rival power center to the russian military and other russian ministries.” the revelations about the wagner group came a day after ukrainian president volodomyr zelensky’s historic visit to washington, where he thanked the united states for its military assistance and said more was needed to fend off russian advances. some background: wagner has emerged as a key player in the 10-month conflict. the group is often described asrussian president vladimir putin’s off-the-books troops. it has expanded its footprint globally since its creation in 2014, and has been accused of war crimes in africa, syria and ukraine. kirby said the us estimates wager currently has about 50,000 personnel deployed inside ukraine, of which 40,00 could be convicts recruited from russian prisons. he said the group was spending $100 million per month to fund its operations in ukraine. the group’s founder, yevgeny prigozhin, has even traveled personally to russian prisons to recruit convicts himself to go to the front lines and fight. some of them suffer from “serious medical conditions,” kirby said. “it seems as though mr. prigozhin is willing to just throw russian bodies into the meat grinder, in bakhmut. in fact, about 1,000 wagner fighters have been killed in the fighting in just recent weeks, and we believe that 90% of those 1,000 fighters were in fact convicts,” kirby said. prigozhin, who has sometimes been referred to as “putin’s chef,” already has close ties to the russian president. but kirby suggested he was working to strengthen those ties through his efforts to bolster russian forces through his mercenary recruitment. “it's all about how good he looks to mr. putin, and how well he's regarded at the kremlin,” he said. “in fact, we would go so far as to say that his influence is expanding.” last month, wagner received a delivery of infantry rockets and missiles from north korea, kirby said, an indication of how russia and its military partners continue to seek ways around western sanctions and export controls. wagner, not the russian government, paid for the equipment. the us doesn’t believe it will significantly change the battlefield dynamic in ukraine — but suggested north korea could be planning to deliver further material. us president joe biden's administration rolled out new sanctions on 10 russian naval entities after russian operations against ukrainian ports, us secretary of state antony blinken announced on thursday. “we are committed to imposing additional severe consequences on president putin and his enablers for russia’s unconscionable war against ukraine.in the wake of russian naval operations against ukrainian ports, including those that are providing much-needed food and grain to the world, the united states today is imposing sanctions on russian naval entities,” blinken said. the entities sanctioned include companies that produce different aspects of russia’s naval capability. one of the sanctioned companies is a battery company, rigel, that hasbeen a supplier to the russian navy for more than 15 years, the us state department said. also sanctioned was a central institute for scientific research, elektropribor, which produces a navigation system for russian combat ships. “the united states remains determined to use all appropriate measures to deter russia’s attacks on ukraine – whether those attacks be from the air, land, or sea. these accountability measures underscore a simple message: the kremlin must end its brutal campaign against ukraine,” blinken said. ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky said in his first video message since leaving washington, dc, on wednesday that he is returning to his country with ""good results."" in a selfie-style message on telegram, the ukrainian president said, “i am coming back from washington. coming with good results, that will really help.” he also thanked us president joe biden for his “assistance and for international leadership and for his commitment to victory."" ""i thank the us congress, to both houses, to all parties who support ukraine, to all those who wish us victory as much as we wish it,” he added. zelensky said that “we are bringing to ukraine, to donbas, to bakhmut and to the south, solutions that our defence forces have been waiting for."" russian president vladimir putin said thursday that patriot missile defense systems are ""old"" systems and russia will""always find the antidote."" ""in regards to patriots, this is quite an old system and it doesn't work as well as our s-300,"" putin said, when asked by a reporter to comment on the united states' decision to provide a patriot system to ukraine. ""those who oppose us think this is a defensive weapon, that's what they say,"" putin said.""but that's in their own mind and we'll always find the antidote."" ""so those doing it are just wasting their time, it's just delaying the conflict,"" putin said. some background: the patriot’s radar system combines “surveillance, tracking, and engagement functions in one unit,” a description from thecenter for strategic international studies (csis)says, which makes it stand out among other air defense systems. the system’s engagements with incoming aerial threats are “nearly autonomous” aside from needing a “final launch decision” from the humans operating it. the group of seven nations “are prepared to do more as needed on budget and economic support” for ukraine in the year ahead, according to a joint statement from the group’s finance ministers thursday. for 2023, the group has mobilized “up to $32 billion us dollars of budget and economic support for ukraine and continue to make further progress,” said the statement published by the german government. “we also strongly encourage other donors to step up their support,” the finance ministers added. in 2022, the g7 mobilized $32.7 billion us dollars of budget support to the ukrainian government, some $18 billion dollars of which came from the european union, according to the g7. “we have a moral imperative to help ukraine resist russia’s unprovoked assault,” the statement said. remember: the g7, orgroup of seven, is made up of allied leaders from some of the world’s largest economies: canada, france, germany, italy, japan, the united kingdom and the us. ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky met with polish president andrzej duda while returning to ukraine from the us. zelensky posted a photo of him on telegram meeting with duda and said, “we summed up the year, which brought historic challenges due to a full-scale war."" ""also we discussed strategic plans for the future, bilateral relations and interactions at the international level in 2023,” he added. from the video accompanying the post, zelensky is seen disembarking from a plane at rzeszow airport. it is unclear what time he arrived in poland. ukrainian defense minister oleksii reznikov said he held a phone call with his us counterpart lloyd austin following ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky's visit to washington, dc, and the announcement that the us will provide the patriot missile defense system to ukraine. reznikov tweeted that “patriotic soldiers will master these systems quickly,” capitalizing part of the word in reference to the defense system. reznikov said he was “grateful for another package of security assistance, especially for the new capabilities to defend out skies from russia’s brutal attacks.” on wednesday, us secretary of state antony blinken announced an additional $1.85 billion in securityassistance for ukraine. additionally, ukrainian air force spokesperson yurii ihnat said he thinks the training of ukrainian soldiers on the patriot missile defense system “will be accelerated.” he added that the training is taken “very seriously” by the americans and that the training is “done strictly according to the rules.” ihnat said on ukrainian television that he hoped the one unit “should be just the beginning” and that the patriot can help protect “important strategic objects” such as infrastructure and headquarters locations. iran clapped back at ukraine’s president volodymyr zelensky and warned of limited “patience for baseless accusations.” iran’s foreign ministry spokesperson nasser kanaani said the speech delivered by zelensky from the united states capitol repeated “accusations and indecent statements.” “we have always respected the territorial integrity of countries, including ukraine, and mr. zelensky should know that iran's strategic patience for baseless accusations is limited,” a published statement by kanaani said. ""mr. zelensky should learn from the fate of some leaders of countries who relied on america's support,"" the statement said. in his speech to the us congress, zelensky said that hundreds of deadly drones sent by iran to russia have become a threat to “critical infrastructure.” some background: the iranian government acknowledged last month that it had sent a limited number of drones to russia in the months before the start of its invasion of ukraine, but has denied supplying military equipment for use in the war in ukraine. russia, zelensky argued in strong terms, has “found an ally” in iran. “that is how one terrorist has found the other,” zelensky said. “it is just a matter of time when they will strike against your other allies if we do not stop them now.” the fallout from ukrainian president volodymr zelensky's historic visit to washington dc continues, with praise at home and warnings from russian officials. meanwhile, belarusian president alexander lukashenko has moved to squash speculation that recent troop movements were part of preparations to join the war in ukraine. here are the latest headlines: lukashenko denies ""conspiracy"" to enter war: the recent movement of belarusian armed forces is not part of a plan to get involved in russia's war in ukraine, lukashenko said on thursday. ""we have been having and are having exercises. now they are more extensive because of the current situation and threats. therefore, we are conducting exercises on our territory,"" said lukashenko.

""it’s key that the zone focuses solely on preventing a nuclear accident. i am continuing my efforts towards this goal with a sense of utmost urgency,"" saidinternational atomic energy agencydirector general rafael mariano grossi. he posted an image on social media of him shaking hands with the ceo of russian nuclear power company rosatom, alexey likhachev. the recent movement of belarusian armed forces is not part of a plan to get involved in russia's war in ukraine, president alexander lukashenko said on thursday. ""we have been having and are having exercises. now they are more extensive because of the current situation and threats. therefore, we are conducting exercises on our territory,"" said lukashenko, according to a statement published on his official website. ""that's it. no other intent, no conspiracy,"" he added. earlier in december, belarus announced snap military drills across the country and a russian delegation led by russian president vladimir putin traveled to belarus to meet lukashenko. this sparked speculation that putin might try to convince lukashenko to help him in the war against ukraine. belarus shares a 674-mile border with ukraine. belarusian territory was used as a platform by russian troops during the invasion in february, but the country's troops have so far not taken part in the conflict. recent troop movements were a response to increased tensions, said lukashenko. ""we cannot rule out that aggression may be deployed against our country,"" he said. ""at least, we see such a readiness on the part of our neighbors."" the white house believes president zelensky made a ""very compelling"" case to the american public and to lawmakers about the need for sustained us aid to ukraine, a senior white house official said. as the white house prepares for republicans — some of whom have cast doubt on the future of aid to ukraine — to take over the house, the official said the white house believes zelensky's speech helped make the case. ""we think he made a compelling case to lawmakers and to the american people about the sacrifices that ukraine has been and continues to make,"" a senior white house official said. ""we believe he made a very compelling case for the reason why support has been so critical in the past and how he believes that support."" while the speech may help the white house in ukraine funding fights to come, the official said zelensky didn't seek help from the white house for his remarks. ""this was all him,"" the official said. zelensky, of course, went further than the white house in his appeals for more aid — making clear in a joking-not-joking tone at both the white house and to congress that current aid levels are still not enough. that was no surprise to the white house, which expected zelensky was ""going to ask for more."" the surprise would have been if he had not. just as he did in response to a question by cnn's phil mattingly, biden has made clear to officials following his meeting with zelensky how beneficial it was for him to meet with the ukrainian leader in person. the senior official said biden ""really enjoyed his time with zelensky"" and found him to be ""energetic"" and dedicated. ##zelensky## ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky visited washington dc on wednesday and made a historic speech from the us capitol, expressing gratitude for american support in fighting russian aggression since the war began — and asking for more. cnn spoke to members of the public throughout ukraine to gauge their reaction to zelensky's visit and the way he was received by us lawmakers. mariya hrachova, marketing director, kyiv hrachova told cnn that she is always moved by zelensky's speeches, and wednesday was no different. ""when he spoke to the house of representatives, the way he looked, he didn't wear a suit, he was himself,"" she said. ""he spoke the truth, he said what he wanted, what he had to say, i admire that."" his reception was ""very touching,"" said hrachova, who underlined the effectiveness of the visit in ""bringing back weapons and hundreds of millions of dollars in aid,"" even if more will be needed in future. ""we understand that will need to increase,"" said hrachova. ""i know that there are various views in the american establishment about the situation in ukraine and us support for ukraine, but we hope that the majority in the government and in the congress will support us."" tetyana vasylivna, fruit seller, kyiv vasylivna, who is originally from kherson, also hailed zelensky's visit to washington. ""it seems to me that this visit will bring the end of the war closer,"" she said. ""i think this trip will help us to get victory."" ""i really had tears in my eyes when i see in such a good way he (zelensky) was welcomed,"" she said. ""he is doing a great job as a president, really great, i have no other words to describe him."" oleksandr kuzmenko, computer graphics, kyiv kuzmenko also lent his support to zelensky, saying that it was important that us lawmakers heard about the situation on the ground directly from the ukrainian president, rather than from a third party. ""i'd say he put it across very well, both in terms of messaging and choreography,"" he said. ""it was a good way to emphasize all the points and ask for weapons."" kuzmenko said that he supports zelensky's key messages, and believes the russian invasion has shown the shortcomings of existing world institutions. ""the current world security architecture is ineffective, and we are the reason it needs to be rebuilt, because of our sacrifice,"" he said. ""if we let it pass, it won't be us having to sort ... out this mess, it will be for our children and grandchildren,"" added kuzmenko. оleksandr solonko, ukrainian serviceman, near bakhmut while solonko didn't manage to watch zelensky's speech in washington, he believes that the visit is a positive. ""such visits do not happen by chance. for us, this is an indicator of the commitment of the united states and that we will continue to be supported,"" he said. ""we, the military, are doing our job and expect our government to make progress towards obtaining the necessary weapons and other means to help us drive the occupiers from our land."" it is also part of ""the symbolic war,"" said solonko. ""what will happen behind the scenes of the visit, apart from military cooperation and economic support, is also interesting,"" he said. ""there are probably many more issues that need to be discussed between the representatives of our countries."" ##zelensky## neither us president joe biden nor his ukrainian counterpart volodymyr zelensky showed ""a potential willingness to listen to russia's concerns"" during zelensky's historic visit to the united states on wednesday, according to kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov. ""so far, we can state with regret the fact that neither biden nor zelensky has spoken any words that can be perceived as a potential willingness to listen to russia's concerns,"" peskov said thursday. at no point was zelensky issued with a warning ""against continuing the barbaric shelling of residential buildings in the settlements of donbas,"" said peskov. donbas blankets much of eastern ukraine, and has been the front line of the country’s conflict with moscow since 2014. peskov added that ""there were no real calls for peace."" but during his address to the us congress on wednesday, zelensky did stress that ""we need peace,"" reiterating the 10-point plan for peace devised by ukraine. he also called on us lawmakers to ""strengthen sanctions"" against russia to make the country ""feel how ruinous its aggression truly is."" peskov told journalists, however, that wednesday's meeting showed the us is continuing to wage a proxy war of ""indirect fighting"" against russia down ""to the last ukrainian."" ##zelensky## the us supplying ukraine with patriot missile systems will prolong the ukrainian people's ""suffering,"" said kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov on thursday. ""we see that, in fact, the united states and other countries are following the path of constantly expanding the range and raising the technical level of the weapons that they supply to ukraine,"" peskov said during a conference call. ""this does not contribute to a speedy settlement of the situation, on the contrary."" peskov went on to say this will not prevent russia from achieving its goals in ukraine. ""this leads to the fact that, unfortunately, the suffering of the ukrainian people will continue longer than it could have,"" he added. on tuesday, the us announced a new aid package to ukraine, which included the ""first-ever transfer to ukraine of the patriot air and missile defense system, capable of bringing down cruise missiles, short-range ballistic missiles, and aircraft at a significantly higher ceiling than previously provided air defense systems."" ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky said wednesday that the patriot air defense missile systems would be a ""very important step"" to creating secure airspace. ##zelensky## thewest supplying ukraine with military support and ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky’s visit to washington further demonstrates that ""the collective west is set for a long confrontation with russia,"" said a spokeswoman for russia's foreign ministry. maria zakharova went on to talk about the ""monstrous crimes"" of the ""regime in kyiv,"" adding that no matter how much the west helps arm the ukrainian government, ""they will achieve nothing."" ""as the leadership of our country has stated, the tasks set within the framework of the special military operation will be fulfilled, taking into account the situation on the ground and the actual realities,""zakharova added, referring to russia's war in ukraine, which it calls a special operation. her comments came after zelensky delivered a historic speech from the us capitol, expressing gratitude for american support in fighting russian aggression since the war began — and asking for more. russian presidentvladimir putin called israeli prime minister-designate benjamin netanyahu on thursday to congratulate him on the formation of a new government and to discuss the situations in ukraine and iran, according to a statement fromnetanyahu's office. ""the two leaders discussed a number of issues, chief among them the war in ukraine,"" the statement said. ""prime minister-designate netanyahu told president putin that he hopes a way will be found as soon as possible to end the war and the suffering caused by it."" ""prime minister-designate netanyahu told president putin that he is determined to prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and to curb its attempts to establish a military base on our northern border,""netanyahu's office added. on wednesday, netanyahu officially informedisraelipresident isaac herzog that he had successfully formed a government. netanyahu, who had already served as prime minister for 15 years until being ousted last year, had until midnight local time (5 p.m. et) wednesday to form the government following elections on november 1. in what was a last minute announcement, netanyahu tweeted 10 minutes before the deadline expired: “i have managed.” volodymyr zelensky's visit to washington showed that neither the united states nor the ukrainian president are ""ready for peace,"" russia's ambassador to the us claimed wednesday.  his comments came after zelensky delivered a historic speech from the us capitol, expressing gratitude for american support in fighting russian aggression since the war began — and asking for more. the biden administration's ""conciliatory statements about the lack of intention to start a confrontation with russia are just empty words,"" ambassador anatoly antonov said in a statement distributed by the russian embassy that decried what he described as zelensky's ""hollywood-style trip."" ""what was essentially announced to applauses and sarcastic smirks, was the need to continue the 'proxy war' against our country,"" antonov said. ""till a full victory over us."" ambassador's warning: speaking alongside zelensky earlier wednesday, president joe biden announced the us will send kyiv a patriot missile defense system as part of an additional $1.8 billion assistance package to ukraine. antonov said biden's announcement came despite russia warning the us against providing the system to ukraine. “i think everyone understands perfectly well what fate the personnel, manning these complexes on the territory of ukraine, can face,” he said. the russian ambassador also warned that us involvement in ukraine could lead to an intensification of the conflict. “the provocative actions by the us are steadily leading to an escalation, the consequences of which cannot even be imagined,” he said. ##zelensky## if ever a leader personified their nation, it isvolodymyr zelensky. unbroken, defiant, a civilian forced to don green military garb, the ukrainian presidentspent wednesday in washington, dc,on his daring first trip out of his country since russia's brutal, unprovoked invasion in february. he expressed heartfelt gratitude for america's multi-billion dollar weapons and ammunition lifeline — but made clear he'd never stop asking for more. appearing with extraordinary symbolism at the white house with president joe biden and before a joint meeting of congress, zelensky also bore sobering news. a long, bloody battle for freedom, democracy, and ultimately, the survival of a nation russian president vladimir putin says has no right to exist — a fight for which it's still not clear the free world has the stomach — is nowhere near over. the comic actor-turned-wartime hero effectively put the fate of millions of ukrainians in the hands of american lawmakers, taxpayers and families at a time when there is growing skepticism among the incoming republican house majority about the cost of us involvement. at an emotional peak of his speech in the house chamber, zelensky handed speaker nancy pelosi and vice president kamala harris a ukrainian flag he retrieved from the hottest battle front at bakhmut on tuesday. ""our heroes ... asked me to bring this flag to you, to the us congress, to members of the house of representatives and senators whose decisions can save millions of people,"" he said.

Netanyahu informs Israeli president he has formed government,2022-12-21,42.0,"benjamin netanyahu has officially informed israeli president isaac herzog that he has successfully formed a government, his likud party said wednesday. in what was a last minute announcement, netanyahu tweeted 10 minutes before the deadline expired, ""i have managed."" netanyahu, who had already served as prime minister for 15 years until being ousted last year, had until midnight local time (5 p.m. et) wednesday to form the government following elections on november 1. the new israeli government will likely be the most right-wing in israeli history, including people appointed to ministerial positions who were once considered to be on the extreme nationalist fringes of israeli politics. members of netanyahu's likud party are expected to fill some of the most important cabinet positions of foreign minister, defense minister and justice minister. itamar ben gvir, leader of the jewish power party, will take on the newly expanded public security role, renamed national security minister, overseeing police in israel plus some police activity in the occupied west bank. bezalel smotrich, leader of the religious zionist party, has been named minister of finance, although he's also been given power to appoint the head of the israeli military body, which among its duties handles border crossings and permits for palestinians. aryeh deri, leader of the ultra-orthodox party shas, is expected to serve as both interior minister and minister of health, while a representative from united torah judaism, the other ultra-orthodox party in the five-party coalition, is expected to be minister of housing. not all ministerial positions had been announced as of wednesday evening. special legislation needs to be passed in the coming days before deri, ben gvir and smotrich can be sworn in. deri needs a law to be passed so he can serve as a minister despite his criminal conviction for tax offenses. ben gvir needs legislation as his position expands the powers normally given to the public security minister, and smotrich needs new legislation granting him ministerial power within the defense ministry. all three pieces of legislation are seen as controversial and have had voices beyond netanyahu's political opposition speaking out against them, including security officials. the new government must be sworn in within a week of the israeli parliament, the knesset, being notified -- likely before january 2.",5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.3071604402735829,0.4923363566398621,0.2005031906068325,0.016263269917440426,0,0,0,0,0.08131634958720213,0.9017792959455945,31.0,0.0290896547079224
"Opinion: What 2022's elections taught me about humanity, politics and 'magic sauce'",2022-12-20,43.0,"liberal democracy was hanging on by a thread this year across the world as nations ranging in size from france to the faroe islands went to the polls to choose who would rule them. all too often, though, voters demonstrated a sharp turn to the right or, having little free choice, merely cemented in power ancestral dictators. over the course of this year, i've chronicled 30 national elections on five continents and four oceans -- beginning with france's presidential election in april and continuing through to fiji and tunisia last week. each has had its own unique cast, but often seem to exhibit certain core principles -- object lessons for how people prosper or simply survive in the disparate corners of our planet. first were the game-changers -- nations and people that chose a substantial break with a past that didn't seem to have worked for them, or where leaders promised something better and were able to persuade voters that they had some sort of magic sauce. perhaps the top example this year has been italy. here, the country shed a consummate technocrat, mario draghi, previous longtime president of the european central bank, who as prime minister of italy for 20 months had been piloting his country through the covid-19 pandemic and away from the shoals of utter economic collapse. all while embracing the efforts of ukraine to repel the russian invasion, and its hopes of joining the european union. even in italy's breakneck turnovers of governments, it was a short-lived premiership. in july, draghi resigned in disgust over his treatment at the hands of a parliament that was resisting his every move. in his place, voters chose to install a toxic triumvirate of far-right extremists, led by giorgia meloni. italy's first woman prime minister was at the helm of the most far-right government since the fascist era of benito mussolini. meloni's fellow troika members were matteo salvini, a veteran right-wing extremist, and the 86-year-old four-time italian prime minister silvio berlusconi, an unabashed supporter of russian president vladimir putin. not long after meloni's victory in italy, at the other end of europe, swedish voters were going to the polls with equally dramatic results. they elected a rightist prime minister who needed the nationalist, firmly anti-immigrant sweden democrats to form a government -- a party whose leader jimmie akesson, in pre-election debate, had reportedly refused to choose between president joe biden and putin. the putin factor halfway across the globe, brazil's voters also appeared at first blush to be opting for an abrupt change in direction in october's election. though in this case, it involved shedding right-wing demagogue jair bolsonaro and returning to power the far-left icon, luiz inácio lula da silva. but it was a pyrrhic victory for ""lula,"" as he is known. he was immediately confronted by a parliament with a majority held by the party still controlled by bolsonaro -- a man whose campaign was reportedly supported by donald trump and steve bannon, and who is friendly with putin. in short, don't count out bolsonaro for a minute. a similar political bind had already developed in france. one hand giveth, the other taketh away as voters rewarded president emmanuel macron with a second five-year term in april, the first back-to-back repeat since jacques chirac two decades ago. but then weeks later in june, the same voters removed macron's absolute majority in parliament. instead, they turned over the role of power broker to the far-right icon marine le pen, who macron had twice defeated for the presidency. le pen has well-documented, close ties to putin going back years. (she has also condemned russia's invasion of ukraine, while advocating that sanctions on russia should be removed). coupled with the fourth consecutive victory by hungary's firebrand prime minister viktor orban, putin's staunchest ally within the european union, the kremlin leader has appeared to have cemented a powerful network of supporters on multiple continents. the comebacks all this was happening in deeply entrenched democracies. elsewhere, in the face of broad international condemnation, several long-standing dictators or dynasties managed to cement their single-handed rule of their nations. in the november election in opec-member equatorial guinea, president teodoro obiang, the world's longest-ruling head of state with 43 years in office, won nearly 99% of the vote. little wonder the us state department concluded ""we have serious doubts about the credibility of the announced results."" turning to asia, voters in the philippines who decades earlier shed the long, kleptocratic rule of ferdinand and imelda marcos, somewhat inexplicably returned their son bongbong marcos to power with a resounding victory in may. his victory assured that bongbong and his mother imelda, now aged 93, would likely go unpunished for their family's stolen funds that are estimated to have risen as high as $10 billion during the marcos' rule a half century ago. philippine voters appear simply to be hoping that history won't repeat itself. another of what i iike to call franchise-holders was israel's benjamin netanyahu. he managed to return to power in november's election with the help of far-right parties that both oppose statehood for palestinian territories and embrace israel extending its sovereignty throughout the west bank. one of his allies is itamar ben-gvir, who's been promised the powerful national security ministry. ben-gvir also happens to be the spiritual successor to the jewish defense league and its founder meir kahane, whose violent activities in new york in the 1960s led him to flee to israel and form the anti-arab kach party. the wild cards and then there are those who somehow managed to snatch victory following some very questionable campaign moves. notable among these was denmark's youngest female prime minister mette frederiksen. her campaign was burdened by an ill-considered decision to exterminate the country's entire 17 million-strong mink population after a scare that the critters might be in a position to pass along covid-19 mutations to humans. forced by the uproar to call an election seven months before her term ended, she managed to eke out a victory. this despite her actions costing denmark almost $2 billion to compensate the mink farmers whose livelihood was impacted. as for the faroe islands in the north atlantic, it appears many there would love to break the final bonds that have tied them to denmark since napoleon, with the pro-independence people's party fielding nearly 20% of votes in an election earlier this month. at the time england's magna carta first ushered in the concept of democratic choice, there were barely 300 million people in the world. this year, the global population hit 8 billion. yet as i have chronicled this year, for the most part, democracy of one form or another still is not played out, as the defeat of election deniers in the us midterms suggested. my hope is that enough voters recognize the value of maintaining a system of free choice, even in the hardest of times, to keep democracy alive -- even if they do not always achieve the goal of tolerance, respect and cohesion.",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.022788445154825844,0.6116339365641276,0.03224426259597142,0.020606672619968843,0,0,0,0,0.020606672619968843,4.038807391357991,28.0,0.14424312111992824
Will Erdogan finally deliver on his vow to invade northern Syria?,2022-11-25,44.0,"turkish president recep tayyip erdogan has in the past week launched a series of airstrikes against kurdish militants in northern syria, and has warned that a ground operation will soon follow. the aerial operation that began on sunday and his warnings three days later come after an explosion rocked istanbul a week ago, killing at least six people and injuring more than 80 others. turkish officials blamed kurdish separatists for the explosion, a claim denied by kurdish groups. erdogan said the strikes were ""just the beginning"" and that the turkish armed forces ""will topple the terrorists by land at the most convenient time."" earlier on wednesday, the defense ministry claimed that 471 targets had been hit and that ""254 terrorists have been neutralized"" since the start of the assault, which has been dubbed ""operation claw-sword."" cnn can't independently verify the number of casualties. but erdogan has been pledging an incursion into northern syria since may. he had previously said that an invasion was meant to create a 30-km (20-mile) deep ""safe zone"" that would be emptied of fighters allied to the kurdistan workers' party (pkk), a militant group that turkey and the us deem a terrorist organization. analysts have said that erdogan had stopped short of acting on his vow to invade because he hadn't secured a green light from russian president vladimir putin, whose country has a large military presence in syria. but on wednesday, senior russian negotiator alexander lavrentyev said that moscow has tried to convince turkey to ""refrain from conducting full-scale ground operations."" the northern syrian area targeted by erdogan includes the three key towns of manbij, tel rifaat and kobani, which are under the control of the kurdish-led syrian democratic forces (sdf). the sdf, backed by washington, had been instrumental in the fight against isis since 2014. but its backbone is the kurdish people's protection units (ypg) militia, which turkey considers a wing of the pkk and seeks to eliminate. cnn asked soner cagaptay, director of the turkish research program at the washington institute, how likely the turkish leader is to follow through with his pledge this time. turkey has been saying that it will begin its next incursion for months. are today's claims any different or more serious? i think that taking into consideration the previous turkish incursions into northern syria, this time, something doesn't seem to be moving forward as fast. typically, turkish incursions follow one or two days of cross-border shelling by artillery and drone strikes, and then the military moves in. this time, the cross-border artillery shelling and drone strikes have been going on almost for a week, and [there has been] no [ground] action. so that means something is missing. how do you see the kremlin's recent comments on a potential incursion? do you see it as a green light? now usually, when turkey goes into northern syria, it needs to get a green light from two superpowers militarily present in syria, that is the us and russia. but russia is not aligned. i think russia is wanting more before it green-lights a full-scale turkish incursion. what russia wants is for the turkish government in ankara to engage the assad regime and to commit to ending the war, sort of in a global handshake. and of course, that kind of discussion will take days, if not weeks and months. so i think until we see that kind of discussion maturing and coming to a conclusion, putin will not give his green light to a turkish incursion. given the growing importance of turkey to the west amid the ukraine war, are western states likely to turn a blind eye to an incursion? the us has typically objected to turkish incursions because they target the ypg. but the us has relied on the ypg to fight isis. so, it's never happy when turkey targets the ypg. but this time, things are different. [firstly], the big strategic picture is changing. turkey's importance [to] the us has shifted as us policy zooms out of the desert [middle east], and focuses on the [eurasian] steppe, or zooms out of syria and into ukraine. so, the us view is that turkey's strategic importance has increased. that's the long-term shift. in the short term, there's also a tactical view [in] washington, which is that turkey has objected to nato's nordic expansion. i think ankara has leveraged its hand well by raising objections to sweden's accession. and so right now, washington really doesn't want to irritate turkey. and i think that applies to all key nato allies. iran protests member states of the un human rights council on thursday passed a resolution forming a fact-finding mission to probe iran's human rights violations during nationwide protests over the past months. the motion was called for by germany and iceland, and passed after 25 countries voted in favor, six voted against and 16 abstained during a special session held in geneva. china attempted to remove the article forming the fact-finding mission by submitting an unexpected amendment to the resolution, a move that drew harsh criticism and collapsed after 25 countries voted against it. iran's representative said the draft is ""completely biased in nature and substance and does not reflect the facts and realities."" here's the latest: the iranian government on thursday set up a national committee to investigate deaths linked to the protest movement gripping the country, according to the deputy foreign minister. united nations high commissioner for human rights chief volker turk said on thursday that iran is in a ""full-fledged human rights crisis."" an iranian fan holding a football jersey with the name of mahsa amini was confronted by security staff on friday at iran's match against wales in qatar. footballer voria ghaffouri was arrested on charges of ""dishonorable and insulting comportment towards iran's national soccer team as well as incitement against the regime,"" according to state-aligned news agency tasnim. the digest netanyahu's party signs deal with far-right jewish power party benjamin netanyahu's likud party in israel said friday it had signed a coalition deal with itamar ben gvir's far right jewish power party -- the first agreement between likud and another party as netanyahu works to build a government. ben gvir will take up the newly created position of minister of national security and his party will receive a number of other posts. background: ben gvir's party, on a joint ticket with religious zionism, made major gains in november's election, helping secure netanyahu's path to victory (the two parties have since split). ben gvir had been demanding the public security minister position for some time -- claiming israel has lost control in the face of a wave of palestinian attacks targeting israelis. he showed up to the site of wednesday's jerusalem bomb blasts saying, ""we need to back up our soldiers and our policemen, return to targeted killings (of palestinian militants), rule the state of israel, deter terrorism and charge a price for it."" why it matters: with this portfolio ben gvir will be in charge of police despite he himself having been in trouble with the law -- convicted of anti-arab racism and supporting terrorism. he's also advocated a more permissive open-fire policy for police and soldiers to use against rioters throwing stones and incendiary devices. he also wants new legislation that would give police and soldiers immunity for crimes committed while on duty. india and gulf states to resume free trade talks covering food, energy security india and the gulf cooperation council (gcc) have agreed to resume talks on a free trade agreement, india's trade minister piyush goyal said on thursday, as his nation seeks closer ties with one of its largest trading partners, reuters reported. background: these talks mark the third such attempt by india and the gcc to ink a trade pact, with negotiations previously held in 2006 and 2008. the gcc is a union of six countries in the gulf region including saudi arabia, united arab emirates (uae), qatar, kuwait, oman and bahrain. why it matters: the gcc is india's largest trading partner, goyal said, with bilateral merchandise trade in 2021-22 standing at $154 billion and services trade at $14 billion. the gcc contributes almost 35% of india's oil imports and 70% of gas imports, he said, adding that bilateral talks will be held on a trade mechanism involving the indian rupee and local gulf currencies. cuban president meets with erdogan during rare visit to turkey cuban president miguel diaz-canel met with his turkish counterpart tayyip erdogan on wednesday during a rare official visit to turkey, reuters reported. the two men held bilateral talks and signed cooperation agreements in several sectors and the cuban leader underlined his country's willingness to further improve relations with ankara over energy, tourism and education. background: this is the first trip to turkey by a cuban leader in 27 years, according to turkish media. diaz-canel recently began an international tour including russia, turkey, algeria and china to seek economic support and cooperation in the energy sector. why it matters: the communist-run country is facing severe energy shortages and hours-long blackouts, seeking to bolster its grid with international aid. cuba has been under a us economic embargo since 1962 after the communist revolution led by castro. world cup the welsh football association (faw) said the sport's world governing body fifa told the federation on thursday that rainbow-colored flags and hats will be

Israeli President invites Netanyahu to form government,2022-11-13,45.0,"israel's president isaac herzog asked benjamin netanyahu to form a new government on sunday, allowing the former prime minister to secure the country's top job for a record sixth time and extend his record as the nation's longest-serving leader. netanyahu, who served 12 years as prime minister before losing office in 2021, was recommended by party leaders representing more than half of israel's 120 parliament or knesset members after the president concluded a political consultation with them. ""israel's citizens require a stable and functioning government,"" he said in remarks after the closed-door meeting with netanyahu.

"Netanyahu to be invited to form government, paving way for return of Israel's longest-serving leader",2022-11-11,46.0,"israel's president isaac herzog announced friday he will invite benjamin netanyahu to form israel's next government, paving the way for him to take the country's top job for a record sixth time and extend his record as the nation's longest-serving leader. herzog will officially issue the mandate to netanyahu on sunday, he said. herzog made the announcement after meeting with all the factions in parliament, the knesset, to ask who they would back for prime minister. in a statement released by his office, he said: ""at the end of the round of consultations, 64 members of the knesset recommended to the president the chairman of the likud faction, mk benjamin netanyahu."" he added that 28 knesset members recommended outgoing prime minister yair lapid. the same number chose not to recommend anyone. herzog will meet with netanyahu at the president's residence on sunday to formally give him the mandate. under israeli law, netanyahu will then have 28 days to form a new government, with the possibility of a 14-day extension if required. during negotiations, netanyahu will have to divide up ministries among his coalition partners and haggle over policies. this is where things get interesting. with a four-seat majority in the 120-seat knesset, or parliament, the five factions allied with netanyahu's likud are all potential kingmakers: fail to give any one of them what they want, and they could bring the coalition down. when it comes to the ultra-orthodox parties, their demands are uncontroversial as far as netanyahu is concerned: bigger budgets for religious schools, and the right not to teach their children secular subjects such as math and english. the real showdowns are likely to come with his new extreme right-wing allies. netanyahu rode to power on the back of a stunning showing by the religious zionism/jewish power list, which, with 14 seats, is now the third-biggest grouping in the knesset. its leader, itamar ben gvir, who has a conviction for inciting anti-arab racism and supporting terrorism, has demanded to be made public security minister, in charge of israel's police. ben gvir's partner is bezalel smotrich, who has described himself as a ""proud homophobe."" he has said israel should be run according to jewish law. he has spoken of reducing the power of the supreme court, and striking out the crime of breach of trust -- which just so happens to be part of the indictments against netanyahu in his ongoing corruption trials. netanyahu has long denied all of the charges. if smotrich wins the justice ministry he covets, he may be able to make these things happen, ending netanyahu's legal worries. yet these may be the least of his concerns. having been forced to join forces with the extreme right wing, the sixth reign of netanyahu may end up further alienating the half of israel that didn't vote for the bloc of parties backing him. restrictions on settlements in the occupied west bank could be loosened, prompting international condemnation. violence between israelis and palestinians in the west bank could worsen; 2022 has already seen more people killed on each side than any time since 2015. then there's the potentially explosive issue of the jerusalem holy site known to jews as the temple mount and to muslims as the ḥaram al-sharīf, or noble sanctuary. under the status quo, only muslims are allowed to pray at the compound. ben gvir advocates allowing jews to pray at what is their holiest site. any change could be used as a pretext by palestinian militants to carry out attacks. it would almost certainly be condemned by israel's new friends in the arab world, such as morocco, the uae and bahrain. president herzog himself summed up the issue when a hot mic caught him telling netanyahu's allies in the shas party: ""you're going to have a problem with the temple mount. that's a critical issue. you have a partner that the entire world is anxious about,"" an apparent reference to ben gvir. herzog told another of netanyahu's allies, avi maoz of the avowedly anti-lgbt noam faction: ""there has been concern about things you have said about the lgbt community. all human beings were created in god's image and we must respect everyone. we have only one state of israel. that pertains also to your party."" could a netanyahu-led government have disputes with the united states? netanyahu may not have the same bromance with president joe biden as he did with donald trump, but the two men seem to get along. ""we are brothers,"" biden told netanyahu in a call after the election. ""my commitment to israel is unquestionable. congratulations, my friend."" netanyahu replied: ""we will bring more historic peace agreements [with the arab world], that is within reach. my commitment to our alliance and our relationship is stronger than ever."" netanyahu is vehemently against the us rejoining the iran nuclear deal, but that seems off the table for now. on russia's invasion of ukraine, and israel's reluctance to provide kyiv with defensive weapons, netanyahu promised president volodymyr zelensky to ""seriously examine"" the issue. assuming netanyahu can reach a coalition agreement by the december 11 deadline, the knesset speaker will call a confidence vote within seven days. if all goes to plan, bibi's government will then take office, perhaps on december 18 -- in time for hanukkah, the jewish festival of lights (and miracles).",22.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.37092878368937154,0.4391836958344687,0.1898875201480802,-0.19873360352709904,0,0,0,0,-4.372139277596179,-5.4936548476741915,44.0,-0.12485579199259526
Gulf Arab states can't give up oil. But they can slash their emissions,2022-11-11,47.0,"as western states try to wean themselves off their addiction to hydrocarbons, gulf oil nations have been pushing back hard, warning that a hasty transition away from fossil fuels will be counterproductive. but as they tell the world that it cannot live without the natural resource that has brought them enormous wealth, the gulf states are embarking on their own ambitious clean energy projects. some of the world's largest hydrocarbon producers and exporters, gulf countries are also among the globe's biggest polluters. gas-rich qatar and oil-wealthy saudi arabia have some of the heaviest carbon footprints on the planet. according to the world bank, qatar had the highest carbon emissions per capita as of 2019, followed by kuwait, bahrain, the united arab emirates and saudi arabia. the gulf monarchies are trying to change that, investing billions in the renewable energy sector, a plan that allows them to save more of their hydrocarbons for export to an energy-hungry world. analysts say the move is more than a publicity stunt in a world where hydrocarbons are increasingly stigmatized. it is pragmatic, they say. ""the gulf states are making net zero domestic targets in some ways to increase their hydrocarbon assets for export, to take advantage of a window of opportunity of those products as demand is expected to gradually decline,"" said karen young, senior research scholar at columbia's center on global energy policy. their push for going green at home also helps them battle their longstanding image of being heavy polluters, said rafiq latta, senior correspondent at energy intelligence, an energy information company. ""the last thing the gulf states want is to appear dirty,"" latta told cnn, ""so they are investing heavily in green energy,"" which also opens avenues for business as the green energy industry gains global traction. so, investment in clean energy projects and renewables ""makes very good business sense and pr sense for the gulf,"" he said. gulf petro-states are warning against a quick transition away from hydrocarbons, with the uae calling for a ""mixed energy"" approach that minimizes emissions without cutting hydrocarbons. the uae is one of the biggest oil exporters, but has made renewable and green energy a priority, arguing that clean and dirty energy are complementary, not competing. that view of the symbiotic relationship between the two types of energies that the uae believes in is perhaps best demonstrated by sultan al jaber, the ceo of the nation's main oil company adnoc, who also happens to be the government's climate envoy. he has argued that by 2050, the world will need to produce 30% more energy than today. ""the world needs all the solutions it can get,"" he said at an energy summit in abu dhabi last month. ""it is not oil or gas or solar or wind or nuclear or hydrogen. it is oil and gas and solar and wind ... it is all of the above."" the uae was the first middle eastern state to add nuclear power to its energy mix 14 years ago and the first to set a net-zero emissions goal, by 2050. the gulf state is home to the headquarters of the international renewable energy agency (irena) and is due to host next year's cop28 climate summit. saudi arabia, which has its own climate program, followed by announcing a net zero carbon emissions target of 2060. on monday, crown prince mohammed bin salman said that his $620 billion wealth fund, the public investment fund, will also target net zero emissions by 2050, adding that the kingdom will contribute $2.5 billion to the middle east green initiative, which aims to reduce carbon emissions from regional hydrocarbon production by more than 60%. this month, the united states and the uae signed a memorandum that aims to mobilize $100 billion on clean energy projects that would ""accelerate toward a goal of deploying 100 gigawatts of clean energy by 2035."" one gigawatt can power about 300,000 homes. ""the world will still have demand for oil and the gulf approach, at least in saudi and uae, is to produce a cleaner oil product that emits less carbon from flaring and that is more efficient in extraction methods,"" said young, ""and they are doing that."" the flaring of natural gas is a by-product of oil production, and the waste contributes to severe air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. speaking to cnn's becky anderson on tuesday during the cop27 climate summit in sharm el-sheikh, the uae's minister of climate change and environment mariam almheiri said that the gulf state has been working toward ""a just energy transition."". ""we are ramping up our renewables and at the same time decarbonizing our oil and gas sector,"" almheiri told cnn, adding that the uae now offers some of the lowest carbon footprint oil barrels in the world. much of the hydrocarbons exported by gulf states go to some of the world's biggest consumers and polluters, including china and india. gulf states are however not directly responsible for the carbon footprints left by their consumers, and analysts say it's unrealistic to advocate for a cut in oil and gas extraction and export, as it would be detrimental to gcc economies. ""they've got their own self-interest to look after, and clearly it would be economic suicide to advocate for a radical shift away from oil and gas,"" said latta. ""the turkey is not going to vote for christmas, and the lamb is not going to vote for eid, so i don't see the gulf en masse moving or accelerating away from hydrocarbons any time soon,"" said latta. the uae's mantra of ""maximum energy, minimum emissions"" calls for a combined energy supply in a slow and gradual energy transition to avoid a shock to the global economy. while it is in their self-interest, ""gcc states have first a responsibility to their citizens, and that means they must generate revenue,"" said young. ""right now, the easiest and most efficient way to generate state revenue is to sell oil and gas. so that's what they will keep doing."" iran protests at least 18 people, including two children, were killed in last friday's protests in the city of khash, in iran's sistan and baluchistan province, said amnesty international on thursday. ""this latest deadly incident in sistan and baluchistan province reveals that protesters from the oppressed baluchi minority have borne the brunt of the security forces' particularly vicious crackdown on demonstrations,"" the human rights organization added. last week, protests turned violent in several cities in the province in southeast iran, state media and activists said. sistan and baluchistan, which neighbors pakistan and afghanistan, is home to the long-oppressed baluch ethnic minority and has a history of unrest with armed groups carrying out attacks against iranian security personnel. the deadly protests are part of a wider nationwide movement gripping iran in recent weeks. here is the latest: iran's foreign minister on thursday criticized his german counterpart after she tweeted a message of support for anti-government demonstrators on wednesday. leading iranian actress taraneh alidoosti posted a picture of herself on instagram without the mandatory hijab to show support for the protests. the iranian government labeled london-based news channel iran international as a ""terrorist organization,"" the state-aligned news agency isna reported tuesday, citing the country's information ministry. iranian forces then arrested a journalist from iran international, isna reported thursday. isna, referring to journalist elham afkari as an ""agent,"" reported that she was arrested thursday by the ministry of intelligence while trying to ""flee the country."" iranian officials have identified afkari as the sister of famous iranian wrestler navid afkari, who was executed two years ago, according to the state news agency irna. the digest fifa announces shared flights for israeli and palestinian football fans for 2022 world cup fifa, football's world governing body, announced on thursday that shared flights have been organized to permit israeli and palestinian fans into qatar to watch the 2022 fifa world cup. background: in fifa's press release, the organization's president gianni infantino said, ""we are delighted that an agreement has been reached for israeli and palestinian fans to visit qatar and attend matches during the fifa world cup. with this deal, israelis and palestinians will be able to fly together and enjoy football together."" qatar does not have diplomatic relations with israel, but a temporary consular services office will be set up during the tournament to handle israeli visitors. more than the 8,000 palestinians and 3,800 israelis have bought tickets for the tournament, a source briefed on the matter, but not authorized to speak publicly, told cnn. why it matters: the temporary charter flights between ben gurion airport in tel aviv and hamad international airport in doha, qatar, represent the only official direct flights between the two nations. two gulf arab states neighboring qatar, the uae and bahrain, signed historic normalization agreements with israel in 2020, but despite direct flights for the world cup, a qatari official told cnn that the country's stance on normalization ""has not changed."" lawyer of british-egyptian hunger striker refused prison entry, authorities say he is in ""good health"" khaled ali, a lawyer representing jailed british-egyptian activist alaa abd el-fattah, tweeted thursday that despite a permit, he was denied entry to wadi al natroun prison to visit his client amid mounting concerns over abd el-fattah's deteriorating health. on the same day, egypt's public prosecution said in a statement that a medical report shows jailed british-egyptian writer and activist alaa abd el-fattah is in ""good health."" background: the public prosecution said it has ordered the formation of a medical committee to look into abd el-fattah's health condition following a request by his attorney earlier this month to move him to a medical center. the public prosecution said in the statement that the medical report ""concluded that abd el fattah is in good health and doesn't require moving to a medical center and recommended regular follow up."" abd el-fattah, a leading activist in the country's 2011 uprising who has been imprisoned several times over nine years, escalated a more than 200-day hunger strike on sunday as he stopped drinking water. why it matters: the family of abd el-fattah said thursday that egyptian authorities had intervened medically after the activist stopped drinking water, and urged british authorities to get information about his health status. it'll be bibi: israel's president to invite netanyahu to form next government israel's president isaac herzog announced friday he will invite benjamin netanyahu to form the country's next government. background: herzog will officially issue the mandate ",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.015022428645218007,0.42388812098346773,0.19223693257472554,0.4315522581564943,0,0,0,0,0.4315522581564943,-5.1434189391049,40.0,-0.1285854734776225
Opinion: What Europe makes of America's election result,2022-11-09,48.0,"on newspaper stands across the french capital and online, the early results of america's national elections were quite evident wednesday morning. the world -- or at least the slice of it that continues to embrace the political system called democracy -- has breathed a tentative sigh of relief. while some key results may remain unresolved for some days, with the red wave reduced to a stream, america appears to have rejected the sharp turn toward the right that has marked so many other national elections this year. or as france's leading newspaper le monde put the uncertainty over congress: ""a bad surprise for republicans."" in many cases, the political leanings of the various european media affected the way the results were played. for example, france's center-right daily le figaro splashed across its homepage early wednesday a victory photo of donald trump acolyte j.d. vance in ohio, while conceding, ""contrary to the expectations of donald trump's party, a red wave does not seem to be emerging in the united states. the democrats resisted, notably with a senatorial victory in pennsylvania."" in london, the times, owned by one-time trump ally rupert murdoch, led its homepage with a video of an exultant democrat john fetterman flipping the republican-held senate seat in pennsylvania, observing: ""congress race goes to wire as trump candidates falter."" one central question on the ballot in a number of states -- whether to preserve the right to an abortion in their constitutions in the wake of a us supreme court decision that many here in paris have been telling me for weeks they find difficult to understand -- was also noted in foreign media coverage of tuesday's elections. as french television network tf1 put it wednesday morning: ""three states inscribed the right to abortion in their constitutions."" it's worth pointing out just how far from the norm the american electorate seems to be veering in its absence of a strong right-wing drift tuesday. in such european nations as italy and sweden, right-wing parties have surged to power in national elections. not to mention in israel where benjamin ""bibi"" netanyahu last week swept to a return in coalition with hard-right religious parties that gained historically large votes. in france, while centrist president emmanuel macron managed to eke out a second term last spring, he lost control of the national assembly as the right-wing national front won its largest number of seats in history. indeed, the cover of this week's french news magazine le point led with photos of france's two politically extreme leaders -- far-left jean-luc mélenchon and rightist marine le pen, with the headline: ""the accomplices (and in the end, it's le pen who wins)."" in the blurb beneath, it added: ""spain, sweden, italy ... the populist wave of the right."" in brazil, while leftist luiz inácio ""lula"" da silva last month won a narrow victory over far-right incumbent jair bolsonaro, the outgoing president still managed to win control of parliament and the nation's largest state governments. still, there were some international reporters prepared to see a glimmer of hope for republicans and a brake on democratic euphoria. nirmal ghosh, us bureau chief for singapore's straits times, pointed to the glass-half-empty scenario that even a slim ""republican majority in [the] house will constrain biden, may set stage for trump's return bid in 2024."" the greatest fear, especially in europe, also seemed to be largely tamed -- that a congress firmly in control of trump republicans would abandon america's unyielding and unequivocal support for ukraine in its struggle with russia. indeed, many of russian president vladimir putin's supporters in moscow were hoping that, as reuters put it, ""us midterms will mean less ukraine aid and more chaos."" ukraine's president volodymyr zelensky was direct. american politicians need to show ""unwavering unity,"" he said, at least ""until peace is restored."" as for the kremlin, the first reaction from putin's spokesman dmitry peskov was, as he told reporters on wednesday: ""these elections are important, but the significance of these elections for the future in the short and medium term of our bilateral relations [cannot] be seriously exaggerated. these elections cannot change anything essential. relations still exist and will remain bad."" one clear signal that russia will not be deterred from putin's confrontational approach to the us was the disclosure wednesday morning that wnba star brittney griner, imprisoned in russia since february, is being moved to a penal colony. as the washington post reported, this is ""a type of prison facility known for its brutal living conditions."" indeed, especially given peskov's comments, it's hard to see the biden administration's efforts to win griner's freedom bearing fruit anytime soon. the election comes at a pivotal moment not just for geopolitics but the future of our planet. in egypt, the global climate conference cop27 is underway, with tens of thousands of delegates from across the world attending. now, new life has been breathed into biden's pledge that ""the united states will encourage countries -- particularly major economies -- and the private sector to... help close the gap between current pledges and what the latest science tells us is urgently needed."" the principal fear from most european officials i've talked with wednesday morning, as it has been from the very moment of biden's victory in november 2020, is that his tenure may be simply a brief, if welcome, interregnum rather than a definitive change in direction from the trump years. many europeans in particular remain fixated on trump's remarks earlier this week that suggested on november 15 he would be announcing his candidacy for president in 2024. it's hard to see from this perspective across the pond that there will be any real relief until americans have demonstrated they have really put behind them this era that has been so deeply destructive of the entire trans-atlantic relationship.",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.11035926959344318,0.16770224230630057,0.4505099058151245,0.7281350612507256,0,0,0,0,0.7281350612507256,-4.435890550474143,40.0,-0.11089726376185358
How a rule change helped Netanyahu win Israel's elections,2022-11-07,49.0,"israel's benjamin netanyahu owes his victory in last week's israeli elections partly to a change in election rules promoted by the political opponents he is now shutting out of power, cnn analysis of the november 1 results shows. netanyahu and his allies are set to have a small but clear majority of seats in parliament, the knesset, but they won the popular vote by only a razor-thin margin. one reason his knesset majority is bigger than his popular vote victory is that three parties in the outgoing knesset each got less than 3.25% of the popular vote -- so they get no seats in the new parliament. the irony of the situation is that it was avigdor liberman of the yisrael beiteinu party and yair lapid of yesh atid who pushed to raise the threshold from 2% to 3.25% in 2014, when they were political allies of netanyahu and in government with him. partly because of the rule change they wanted, they're now part of the outgoing coalition that he defeated. the lapid-liberman coalition would have gained seats if the threshold was still 2%. another reason netanyahu won decisively is that two small parties in the anti-netanyahu camp didn't join forces with bigger parties, one of israel's leading pollsters said. if the left-wing meretz party had run on a joint ticket with labor, and the arab party balad had not broken away from the joint list party they ran with last time, then tuesday's election would have produced a 60-60 deadlock, camil fuchs, a leading israeli pollster, told cnn monday. both parties failed to cross the threshold: meretz won 3.2% of the popular vote and balad took 2.9%. together they drew less than 300,000 votes. all the votes for those parties were effectively discarded. the popular vote was extremely close. if all the votes for the parties in the outgoing knesset are counted, netanyahu and his allies come out less than 40,000 votes ahead of their opponents, out of more than 4.7 million votes cast. there were 40 parties running in the november 1 election, of which 13 got more than 0.5% of the popular vote. five of those 13 -- likud, religious zionism/jewish power, shas, united torah judaism, and jewish home -- are on the pro-netanyahu side of israel's political divide. together they took 49.6% of the popular vote, final results from the central election committee show -- about 2.36 million votes. the other eight are anti-netanyahu and took 48.9% of the popular vote, or about 2.33 million votes -- a difference of 0.7 percentage points, or just over 30,000 votes. the exact number of votes per party will be certified on november 9. but the electoral threshold rule worked in netanyahu's favor. only one of the parties on his side, jewish home, failed to get more than 3.25% of the total vote; they got 1.2%, or 56,760 votes -- and would have been forced out of the knesset under the old 2% rule, anyway. the threshold has been decisive in at least one previous election. labor leader yitzhak rabin became prime minister in 1992 although the left lost the popular vote; a right-wing party failed to cross the threshold, which was 1.5% at the time. iran protests iranian lawmakers issued a letter on sunday to the country's leadership calling for severe punishments to be meted out to those found guilty of being involved in the protests, according to state-run press tv. the letter was signed by 227 of iran's 290 members of parliament, and it compared some of the protesters to isis militants. the letter from the mps also reiterated government claims that the ongoing protests were incited by the united states and other enemies of iran. iran has provided no evidence to back up its claims of foreign involvement in the protest movement. here's the latest: video posted on social media showed iranian beach soccer player saeid piramoon celebrating after scoring a goal against brazil by doing a symbolic move mimicking hair-cutting, apparently in support of protesters. iranian woman nasrin qadri died in tehran on saturday after ""suffering severe injuries"" caused by baton blows to the head wielded by iranian security forces, according to kurdish human rights group hengaw and activist outlet iranwire. nasrin's father said in an on-camera statement that aired on state television that his daughter died of the flu. asked about the situation in iran, pope francis didn't specifically address it specifically but said that a society that does not value women's equality is one that will not progress. the digest british pm to raise issue of jailed british-egyptian writer with egyptian leadership during cop27 trip british prime minister rishi sunak has written to the sister of jailed british-egyptian writer and activist alaa abdel-fattah, who is imprisoned in cairo, saying he is ""deeply committed"" to resolving her brother's case. in the letter to abdel-fattah's sister, shared with cnn by his family, sunak said he was ""very concerned"" to hear of the writer's ""deteriorating health,"" adding his case ""remains a priority for the british government."" background: abdel-fattah is a leading activist in the country's 2011 uprising who has been imprisoned over the course of nine years. he was sentenced most recently in december 2021 to five years on charges of spreading false news. why it matters: abdel-fattah escalated a more than 200-day hunger strike on sunday as he stopped drinking water, his sister, activist sanaa seif, tweeted. in a letter written to sunak and shared with cnn, seif said: ""it is my sincere belief that if alaa is not released within the coming days that he will die in person, quite possibly while you are in egypt."" a uk foreign ministry spokesperson told cnn in a statement that the government was working hard to secure abdel-fattah's release. iran acknowledges drone shipments to russia 'before war'; kyiv says tehran is lying iran acknowledged for the first time on saturday that it had supplied moscow with drones but said they were sent before the war in ukraine. foreign minister hossein amirabdollahian said a ""small number"" of drones had been shipped a few months before russia's february invasion. ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky accused tehran of lying. background: in recent weeks ukraine has reported a surge in drone attacks on civilian infrastructure, notably targeting power stations and dams, using iranian-made drones. russia denies its forces have used iranian drones to attack ukraine. ""we shoot down at least ten iranian drones every day, and the iranian regime claims that it allegedly gave little and even before the start of the full-scale invasion,"" zelensky said. why it matters: the european union last month agreed to new sanctions on iran over drone deliveries, and britain imposed sanctions on three iranian military figures and a defense manufacturer. amirabdollahian repeated tehran would ""not remain indifferent"" if it were proven russia had used iranian drones against ukraine. sweden to distance itself from kurdish groups in bid to join nato sweden's new government will distance itself from the ypg, a kurdishmilitia, as it tries to win turkey's approval to join nato, reuters cited sweden's foreign minister as telling swedish radio on saturday. background: turkey considers the syrian kurdish ypg militia and its political branch pyd to be extensions of the kurdistan workers party (pkk), which launched an insurgency against turkey in 1980 and is regarded as a terrorist group by turkey, the united states and the european union. sweden, along with the us and several other nato countries, has supported the ypg in the fight against isis. why it matters: turkey has vowed to block sweden's application to join nato if it doesn't stop supporting the militia group. the swedish move comes just days before prime minister ulf kristersson is due to travel to ankara to try to convince turkey's president tayyip erdogan to let sweden join the military alliance. sweden and finland applied to join nato earlier this year as a direct consequence of russia's invasion of ukraine. what to watch toomaj salehi, an iranian rapper who has used his politically charges lyrics to call for protests, was arrested by the islamic republic and charged with crimes punishable by death. the underground artist had been rebelling against the regime for years. cnn's jomana karadsheh tells his story here: around the region long before world leaders began flocking into egypt's red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh for the cop27 climate summit on sunday, australian activist mike smith had been laboring on the country's river nile banks, picking up used plastic bottles. his mission resulted in the creation of a large, three-story pyramid of nearly 1 million compressed plastic bottles, put together on display in egypt's giza plateau just days ahead of the summit. ""it's an audacious project we're launching, with an aim of cleaning the planet every year, for the next 100 years,"" smith told the australian associated press. ""the goal is to be able to pull 15 million water bottles worth of rubbish out of the natural environment, every year, all around the world."" the activist has been campaigning to reduce the proliferation of single-use plastics for years with attention-grabbing projects. last year, he used his start-up, zero co, to push australian households to eliminate single-use plastics from their homes. and in 2020, he reportedly went snorkeling with more than 3,000 plastic bottles strapped to his back to raise awareness of the dire effects of ocean pollution. as world leaders arrive in egypt to begin this year's climate summit, smith told the australian associated press that he will be sleeping in a small tent on top of his plastic-bottle pyramid. cop27 runs from sunday till november 18. by nadeen ebrahim photo of the day ",8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.2894629156216979,0.27326505444943905,0.4372720755636692,0.37411574044385176,0,0,0,0,2.992925923550814,-1.8299672842581787,46.0,-0.03978189748387345
Opinion: What a Netanyahu comeback means for Israel -- and the world,2022-11-03,50.0,"if former saturday night live great and actor bill murray wasn't hired as a technical adviser to israel's central elections committee, he surely might have been. based on pre-election polling it seemed that israel was headed for yet another groundhog day-style hung election for the fifth time in just short of four years. but this election seems to have produced (final figures won't be available until week's end) what the previous four could not: a majority for benjamin (bibi) netanyahu and his allies and the likely emergence of the most right-wing government in israel's history. indeed, the biggest star in the new political firmament wasn't netanyahu but the extremist itamar ben gvir, whose bloc religious zionism is now the third largest in the knesset. here are four things you should know about this election and what may lie ahead. to bibi or not to bibi like its four predecessors, this election had one central fault line, if not organizing principle. are you for or against the return of netanyahu? love him or despise him, netanyahu, at 73, has been the longest governing prime minister in israel's history. even under indictment and on trial for bribery, fraud and breach of trust, netanyahu is still the most consequential politician on the israeli scene today and is on the cusp of perhaps his greatest triumph -- returning to the prime ministry with a majority. for netanyahu this election was truly existential. had he failed to secure a governing majority -- one that is likely to pass legislation to postpone or even cancel his trial -- he may well have had to face the consequences of a guilty verdict or a plea bargain that would have driven him away from politics. but netanyahu's victory wasn't just an ""all about me"" headline. it reflects and consolidates trend lines that have been in evidence for quite some time. likud is the most stable and durable political party in israel's system. netanyahu is its master and israel is a nation now shaped more by the right wing -- and perhaps its most extreme elements -- than at any point in its history. the left and center-left in israel once dominated by the iconic labor party, the driving political force for the first three decades of independence, has been reduced to a shadow of its former self with just a handful of seats in the knesset. and while the center-left and right bloc of the caretaker prime minister yair lapid made a respectable showing -- perhaps even garnering more votes -- the fracturing of the left and the arab vote gave the advantage to the more cohesive and disciplined netanyahu bloc. indeed, without overdramatizing matters, netanyahu's victory now introduces a cult of personalities -- netanyahu and ben gvir -- that will strengthen the forces of radical nationalism; populism and an us against them mentality dividing and polarizing the country. and if the netanyahu government succeeds in restricting the powers of the israel supreme court, imposing control over judicial appointments, deepening the grip of jewish law over public life and reversing the court's decision to strike down legislation aimed at legalizing west bank settlements, israeli democracy will be fundamentally undermined, reinforcing the forces of illiberalism, ethnocentrism and disrespect for the rule of law. there's the right and the extreme right israel has been drifting rightward for years. indeed according to analyst tamar hermann of the israeli democracy institute, a full 60% of the israeli electorate is right-wing; 12-14% identifies as left and the remainder are in the so-called center. but while polling had predicted that the religious zionism -- a bloc of three extremist parties that collectively embody a racist, jewish supremacist, anti-arab and homophobic view -- would do well in the election, the extent of their success was nonetheless stunning. religious zionism doubled its numbers from the 2021 election and gvir, the clear star of the bloc, attracted new voters -- and according to exit polls, raised national turnout by about 6%. it's also going to prove a stunning moment for netanyahu who midwifed this unholy alliance in an effort to maximize his chances of securing the magic number of 60-plus seats to form a government. it's hardly a coincidence that one of the parties in this bloc led by bezalel smotrich has authored a plan to reform (read emasculate) the judicial system and ensure that netanyahu is immune from prosecution. the new prime minister is now beholden to these extremists and the two ultra-orthodox parties who will have a long list of demands. indeed, likud polled 31 seats, the right wingers and ultras have as many or more, effectively making him a minority within his own government. more than that netanyahu now has a partner-rival in ben gvir who, at 46, is just starting his rise in israeli politics. it should surprise no one if netanyahu tries to reach out to the more centrist party of benny gantz and gideon saar to join his coalition to ""save the nation"" in an effort to check ben gvir or at a minimum to lessen his extremist demands. policy paralysis? one might be forgiven for thinking that this kind of narrow right-wing government might not last. but there may be more that binds this coalition together than divides it. the two orthodox parties have been out of power and are eager to secure support for their religious schools and institutions. the ben gvir-dominated religious zionism bloc sees participation in the government as a way to legitimize his movement, expand his base and his own political horizons. he began his election victory speech by declaring, ""i'm still not prime minister."" and netanyahu surely will try mightily to keep this coalition together in order to secure his get-out-of-jail-free card through legislation. how will this government actually behave? it's safe to say as israel's 75th anniversary approaches next year, it won't bring the country any closer to tackling the domestic and foreign policy challenges it faces and will almost certainly make them worse. at home, israel will be increasingly polarized, with an independent judiciary and rule of law under serious threat. netanyahu has proven himself inherently risk-averse when it comes to acting on matters of war and peace. and he'll try and keep ben gvir far away from influencing israel's national security; and push back on his demands to disband the palestinian authority, annex the west bank and expel palestinians. but there will be more settlements and support for settlers; more effort to consolidate control over jerusalem; relations with israel's arab citizens will likely deteriorate with fewer resources for their community and if there's a serious confrontation with palestinians in the west bank or in jerusalem the odds of it morphing into a conflict between israeli jews and arabs will likely grow. there will be some constraints on the government's behavior. netanyahu is certainly not interested in a confrontation with hamas or hezbollah. he'll want to preserve the recently concluded maritime boundary agreement with lebanon, maintain the abraham accords with the uae and bahrain and to lay the groundwork for relations with saudi arabia. netanyahu and biden: an inevitable blow up? neither president joe biden nor netanyahu will seek out a confrontation. the white house has already put out the following statement. ""we look forward to continuing to work with the israeli government on our shared interests and values."" both are far too busy with other matters to want such a problematic distraction. but even without being tethered to the extremist ben gvir, netanyahu's relations with biden would have been difficult as their views on settlements, treatment of palestinians in the west bank and building in jerusalem would have clashed. on iran, netanyahu's rhetoric will intensify. and should the biden administration have an opportunity to revive the iran nuclear accord, netanyahu will resume his earlier campaign in 2015 to make common cause with republicans to oppose it. indeed, netanyahu, much like saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman, would be much more comfortable with the return of donald trump or his republican avatar. in short, with his dance card already full with matters foreign and domestic, the return of netanyahu, let alone tied to an extremist right wing coalition partner likely to roil the already tense situation with palestinians -- is something biden surely didn't want or need.",25.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.34901618473231794,0.23631102453917266,0.4146727888658643,0.08475541955519228,0,0,0,0,2.118885488879807,1.8993594542416616,57.0,0.0333220956884502
Israel Prime Minister Yair Lapid congratulates Benjamin Netanyahu on election victory,2022-11-03,51.0,"israeli prime minister yair lapid called benjamin netanyahu to congratulate him on winning israel's elections, the prime minister's office announced thursday, just under 48 hours after polls closed. israel's central election committee on thursday announced the final allocation of seats for the 25th knesset, giving netanyahu and his likely political allies 64 seats in the legislature, enough for a governing majority. president isaac herzog will begin consultations with politicians on forming a new government after results are officially certified on november 9, he said wednesday. a netanyahu return to the head of government could spell fundamental shifts to israeli society. a netanyahu government would almost certainly include the newly ascendant jewish nationalist religious zionism/jewish power alliance, whose leaders include itamar ben gvir, once convicted for inciting racism and supporting terrorism. when asked by cnn on tuesday about fears he would lead a far-right government if he returns to office, netanyahu responded with an apparent reference to the ra'am party, which made history last year by becoming the first arab party ever to join an israeli government coalition. ""we don't want a government with the muslim brotherhood, who support terrorism, deny the existence of israel and are pretty hostile to the united states. that is what we are going to bring,"" netanyahu told cnn in english at his polling station in jerusalem. netanyahu allies have talked about making changes to the judicial system. that could put an end to netanyahu's own corruption trial, where he has pleaded not guilty. netanyahu himself has been one of the main issues not only in tuesday's election but in the four that preceded it, with voters -- and politicians -- splitting into camps based on whether they want the man universally known as bibi in power or not. part of the difficulty in building a stable government over the past four elections has been that even some political parties that agree with netanyahu on the issues refuse to work with him for personal or political reasons of their own. the election was marked by the highest turnout since 2015. the central election committee said 71.3% of eligible voters cast their ballots, which was more than in any of the last four elections that produced stalemates or short-lived governments.",10.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.38861547033302485,0.3081120351329446,0.3032724781660363,-0.08789090723709982,0,0,0,0,-0.8789090723709981,5.392589659466842,45.0,0.11983532576592983
A far-right surge is set to put Netanyahu back in power. Who are his extremist allies?,2022-11-02,52.0,"israel's longest-serving prime minister, benjamin netanyahu, looks set to storm his way back into power, with partial election results suggesting he and his allies have won a clear majority of seats in the knesset. those allies include the far-right religious zionism/jewish power bloc, which appears to have more than doubled the number of seats it holds -- and which could make the next government the most right-wing in israel's history. the other two probable netanyahu coalition partners are ultra-orthodox party united torah judaism and religious sephardi party shas, which have long histories of being in government. both have traditionally sought support for their own communities and worked to keep control of israel's religious establishment. but this would be the first time that religious zionism/jewish power could have control of government ministries. settler politics the religious zionism/jewish power leaders draw much of their support from the settler movement -- jews who live primarily in the west bank and believe jews should control the occupied territories. having them in positions of power, like the defense or public security ministries, could make israeli-palestinian relations even worse than they are now. journalist anshel pfeffer, who has written a biography of netanyahu, suggested before the vote that bringing religious zionism/jewish power into government could mean expansion of the settlements, which are considered illegal under international law. but that may be their price for joining netanyahu's coalition, he said. ""perhaps some settlements in the west bank which were in the past abandoned by israel, will be rebuilt, reoccupied?"" pfeffer said. ""and perhaps further steps towards some type of annexation in the west bank?"" the party leaders are settlers themselves: itamar ben gvir, who's been convicted of inciting anti-arab racism and supporting terrorism; and bezalel smotrich, who once told arab members of the israeli parliament that they were ""here by mistake because [israel's first prime minister david] ben gurion didn't finish the job and throw you out in 1948."" that's when israel became a state and when many palestinian families either fled, or were expelled from their homes in the land that became israel. ben gvir was spotted last month drawing a gun during stone-throwing clashes in the flashpoint east jerusalem neighborhood of sheikh jarrah, telling israeli police to shoot arabs if they threw stones. he opened a so-called ""office"" -- in fact, a small tent -- on a patch of scrub land in sheikh jarrah last year in order to assert jewish presence in the east jerusalem neighborhood. that's the flashpoint area where attempted evictions of palestinian families by jewish groups who claim ownership of the land have become rallying cries and symbols for the palestinian cause. clashes there soon after he put up the tent were among the triggers for 11 days of war between palestinian militants in gaza and the israel defense forces last year. a trained lawyer, ben gvir has argued settlers' cases right up to israel's supreme court. pugnacious partner his ally bezalel smotrich can be just as pugnacious. smotrich, who briefly served as transport minister when he was a member of the jewish home party, has argued, for example, that people should make no bones about it when they hate someone. ""the most natural instinct, the most normal instinct of a normal man that loves those who love him and hates those who hate him, is to not turn the other cheek,"" he said to defend a bill he co-sponsored to deny entry to israel to supporters of israel boycotts. when smotrich talks of men loving men who love them, he does not mean it in a sexual sense. smotrich has described himself as a ""proud homophobe"" and as a young man helped organize an anti-pride parade event called the beast parade, comparing homosexuality to bestiality. he later told the israeli newspaper haaretz through a spokesperson that he regretted having done that. but as recently as september, he said lgbtq people did not deserve any more ""recognition"" than people who violated traffic laws. ""i want to drive through a red light, and i want recognition,"" he joked on an israeli talk show, haaretz reported. smotrich is proposing drastic changes to israel's legal system and code, including dropping the state's ability to charge a public servant with fraud and breach of trust. netanyahu faces exactly that charge in an ongoing corruption trial asked about smotrich's proposal by cnn's fareed zakaria, netanyahu demurred and said, ""i wouldn't do anything that affects me. i think my trial is unraveling as it is."" the man in charge? current projections show netanyahu's likud party will be the biggest in the likely coalition, probably in command of around 32 seats, and the man israelis call ""bibi"" says that means he'll be in the driver's seat. he told zakaria last month that, even if he did partner with extremist parties, they would not set policy. ""i've had such partners in the past, and they didn't change an iota of my policies. i decide the policy with my party, which is the largest party by far in the country. and we are a center-right party and a responsible party, but we are not going to adopt norms for the government that we don't agree with,"" netanyahu said. netanyahu hasn't yet made it back to the prime minister's office, even though the signs look very good for him. votes are still being tallied, and the result won't be final until each one is counted. at that point, election officials will be able to dole out seats to each party that got more than 3.25% of the national vote. then president isaac herzog will give a mandate to form a government to the politician he thinks is most likely to be able to build a coalition. that process has been torturous in the four elections since april 2019 that preceded this one. but if the latest projections are correct, netanyahu should have a clear path to a majority government -- and the power to shift israel significantly to the right. correction: this story has been updated to clarify that while religious zionism/jewish power have never controlled government ministries, smotrich was transport minister in 2019-2020 when he was a member of the jewish home party.",9.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.2628750979072518,0.37499022194080883,0.3621346751848857,0.15129277433919258,0,0,0,0,1.3616349690527332,6.322672370363081,53.0,0.11929570510119021
Netanyahu is back. Here's what that means for Israel,2022-11-02,53.0,"benjamin netanyahu is set to resurrect his political career and make an astonishing comeback as prime minister of israel. partial election results on wednesday showed that the likud party leader's bloc was set to win a comfortable majority of 65 seats in the 120-seat knesset, or parliament, in an election that saw a seven-year high turnout. having been sidelined by much of the country's political mainstream, netanyahu was given a lifeline by the rise of a far-right party, some of whose leaders are arguably extremists. netanyahu is now likely to lead an ever-polarized country and possibly one of the most right-wing governments in israel's history. and after five elections in four years, this government might just stick, says yohanan plesner, president of the israel democracy institute. cnn spoke to plesner about what a netanyahu return could mean for the country. what do you make of the exit polls and partial election results? could netanyahu make a comeback in israel? judging by the actual results and all the exit polls, netanyahu is undoubtedly israel's next prime minister. he single-handedly brought out his base on election day at higher percentages than we saw in previous rounds, and while in the end many of them ended up voting for his allies on the right and not for his likud party, this is what made the difference and was able to break the stalemate of the past four years. if the numbers we are seeing hold true, netanyahu will have a governing coalition of between 62 and 65 seats, depending on whether some of the smaller parties pass the minimal threshold, consisting of his likud party and its ultra-orthodox and extreme-right allies. how likely would a netanyahu-led government be to include far-right parties, and what would the implications of their inclusion be? it is very unlikely that netanyahu will renege on his central campaign promise to include all members of his bloc in his government -- including [jewish power leader itamar] ben gvir and his partner from the religious zionist party bezalel smotrich. over his 15 years as prime minister, netanyahu has proven to be a cautious leader on diplomatic and security matters. while some in the international community have criticized his refusal to make significant concessions to the palestinians to advance a peace process, he has traditionally also been reluctant to change the status quo in the west bank in favor of his allies in the settlement movement and often hesitated before committing the israel defense forces (idf) to major military operations. this cautious approach is not expected to change. the question will be if ben gvir -- who has a history of provocative actions against arab israelis and palestinians -- can be trusted to moderate now that he will be in office and not ignite fires that netanyahu will be forced to put out. one particular area to focus on is the temple mount complex [al haram al sharif] in jerusalem which is holy to both muslims and jews. since israel took control of the area from jordan in 1967 an uneasy status quo has ensured that jews are allowed to visit but not pray at this site. ben gvir and his allies have been advocating for years to change this policy. a conflict ignited there could quickly spread throughout israel and even further in the region. what would netanyahu's return mean for his trial, and what would it mean for israel's judicial system? during the campaign, netanyahu's allies in the religious zionist party, as well as key members of his likud party, explicitly ran on the platform of overhauling the judicial system. motivated by ideology, they proposed to politicize the judiciary by ensuring that judges and legal advisers are appointed by and beholden to political leaders, as well as weaken the checks and balances that exist between the branches of government by instituting an ""override clause"" that would allow the knesset to overrule supreme court decisions. for netanyahu, such reforms could serve as an escape hatch from his ongoing criminal trials, where he is facing corruption charges, but more importantly, it would also fundamentally alter the existing constitutional order that serves as the foundation for israeli democracy. this election registered the highest voter turnout since 2015. what does that say? despite its many challenges, israelis have proven how committed they are to their democracy. while we do not yet have all the data about turnout, it appears that in this election both arab israelis and members of the ultra-orthodox community were particularly motived to vote. ahead of the election there were concerns that low turnout in arab israeli localities could lead to only one of their three parties crossing the electoral threshold. this seemed to have led to an increase in their turnout. nevertheless, due to overall high turnout, their representation in the knesset will probably remain at around 10 seats -- the same as in the outgoing parliament. for the ultra-orthodox, the fact that this [the outgoing government] was the first governing coalition they were excluded from since 2015 seems to have motivated their voters to turn out at much higher rates than expected. if the results we are seeing hold true, the ultra-orthodox parties will play an outsized role in netanyahu's coalition. if netanyahu does form a government, how likely is israel to return to elections in the near future? while instability has plagued the israeli political system for decades, netanyahu's significant victory and the homogeneous nature of what is likely to be the next government, could ensure that it serves close to a full term. when the final results are tabulated, if the netanyahu bloc stands at more than 62 seats, it will take more than one or two disgruntled members of parliament to dismantle it. this means that only in the case of a significant policy disagreement between the coalition partners can we expect this new government to fall. thus, these elections seem to mark the end of the current crisis that has characterized israel over the past four years. this interview has been edited for length and clarity. iran protests iran indicted about 1,000 people in tehran province for their alleged involvement in nationwide protests sparked by mahsa amini's death in police custody, state-news irna said on monday. people who ""have serious accusations, including assaulting or martyring security guards, and setting fire to public property... have been scheduled in revolutionary court"" ali al-qasi mehr, chief justice of tehran province said, according to irna. the trials of those accused will be heard in public this week, irna said, citing mehr. here's the latest: dissident iranian rapper toomaj salehi, known for anti-regime lyrics, was arrested on sunday, according to state-run irna. he was charged with ""propagandistic activity against the government, cooperation with hostile governments and forming illegal groups with the intention of creating insecurity in the country."" the european union is considering ""further steps"" against iran, german chancellor olaf scholz on monday, after the bloc announced sanctions on iran's morality police earlier in october. iranian police said tuesday they will investigate an incident caught on camera showing security forces attacking a man, fars news agency said. in the video, security personnel are seen beating a man lying on the ground in front of a residential building. one officer points his gun at him and shoots. the digest iran prepares to send additional weapons including ballistic missiles to russia, western officials say iran is preparing to send approximately 1,000 additional weapons, including surface-to-surface short-range ballistic missiles and more attack drones, to russia to use in its war against ukraine, officials from a western country that closely monitors iran's weapons program told cnn. while the precise timing of when the shipment will arrive in russia is unclear, officials believe the weapons will definitely be delivered before the end of the year. background: russia's use of drones in ukraine increased in the summer, when the united states and kyiv say moscow acquired the aircraft from iran. in recent weeks iranian drones have targeted critical energy infrastructure in ukraine. the last shipment of weapons from iran to russia included about 450 drones, officials said. why it matters: the shipment would mark a significant increase in iranian support to russia's war effort. it would be the first instance of iran sending advanced precision-guided missiles to russia, which could give the kremlin a substantial boost on the battlefield. us, saudi arabia concerned iran may be planning an attack on middle east energy infrastructure the us and saudi arabia have shared intelligence with each other that indicates that iran may be planning an imminent attack on energy infrastructure in the middle east, particularly in saudi arabia, a us official told cnn. a saudi official told cnn that riyadh shared intelligence of a possible attack with the us but the source did not give any specifics. a second us official said us f-22 fighter jets are already in saudi arabia and available to counter any threats. background: iran is facing over a month of unrest that started after the death of amini, a 22-year-old woman, in police custody. the islamic republic has repeatedly accused saudi arabia of supporting the protesters through its media channels, warning it of consequences. why it matters: saudi arabia faced a major attack on its oil facilities in 2019 that cut half the country's oil production and jolted the global crude market. the us blamed iran for that attack. the iran-allied houthi group in yemen has also threatened to strike saudi arabia of late. climate activist greta thunberg not attending 'greenwashing' cop27 summit in egypt teenage climate activist greta thunberg said she will not be attending the cop27 climate summit in egypt, criticizing the event as ""greenwashing.""

"Netanyahu on course to lead Israel's most right-wing government ever, partial Israel results suggest",2022-11-02,54.0,"benjamin netanyahu appears to be on course for a bigger victory in israel's fifth election in less than four years than initial exit polls suggested, all three of the country's main television channels projected wednesday morning. his likud party and its natural allies are currently projected to win 65 seats in the 120-seat knesset, with 86% of the votes counted as of wednesday afternoon israel time. a coalition of netanyahu's likud, the jewish nationalist religious zionism/jewish power bloc, shas and united torah judaism would, on paper, be the most right-wing government in israel's history. current prime minister yair lapid and his allies appear to be on track to win 50 seats. an arab alliance called hadash-taal looks is projected to win five seats, and is unlikely to support either netanyahu or lapid to lead the country. voter turnout was 71.3%, the central election committee said. that's the highest since 2015, according to the committee -- higher than any of the four previous elections, 2019 to 2021, which produced stalemates or short-lived governments. since initial exit polls on tuesday night, a left-wing party called meretz appears to have fallen below the 3.25% threshold to win any seats in the knesset. if the party manages to win enough of the national vote to get seated in parliament, the final results could change. these are not final results; one in five votes nationwide remain to be counted. final results could come as soon as later wednesday, but could take until thursday to arrive. a netanyahu return to the head of government would spell fundamental shifts to israeli society. it would include the newly ascendant jewish nationalist religious zionism/jewish power alliance, whose leaders include itamar ben gvir, once convicted for inciting racism and supporting terrorism. and netanyahu allies have talked about making changes to the judicial system. that could put an end to netanyahu's own corruption trial, where he has pleaded not guilty. netanyahu himself had been one of the main issues not only in tuesday's election but in the four that preceded it, with voters -- and politicians -- splitting into camps based on whether they wanted the man universally known as bibi in power or not. part of the difficulty in building a stable government over the past four elections has been that even some political parties that agreed with netanyahu on the issues refused to work with him for personal or political reasons of their own. getting the official results is going to take some time -- they could be ready as soon as wednesday, but it might be thursday before the final makeup of israel's 25th knesset is clear. that's partly because parties need to win at least 3.25% of the total vote in order to get any seats in the knesset at all, a threshold established in an effort to make coalition building easier by keeping very small parties out of the legislature. to determine how many seats each party gets, election officials first need to determine which parties crossed the threshold. then they can work out how many votes it takes to win a single knesset seat, and dole out seats to the parties based on the number of votes they got..",8.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.40170337224844843,0.24992606206797063,0.34837054819217883,-0.18779580891317255,0,0,0,0,-1.5023664713053804,4.063319634314573,70.0,0.058047423347351045
"In Brazil and Israel, leaders show Trump there can be political next acts",2022-11-02,55.0,"it's the season of political comebacks, and don't think ex-president donald trump isn't watching. twice in as many days, in brazil and israel, former world leaders who just can't give up that tantalizing taste of political ambition have moved to the cusp of a return to power. past scandals, their own legal nightmares and treacherous politics aren't stopping them from recreating that dream of a past glory. trump would love to plow a similar furrow. both former brazilian president luiz inácio ""lula"" da silva and ex-israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu have shown that time out of power could be a springboard for unlikely political rebounds. this may be a hopeful sign for trump, who has leveraged the midterm elections next week as a show of his own power within the republican party, anointing a crop of nominees who promote his 2020 election fraud falsehoods. trump has left no doubt that he's itching to mount another presidential campaign -- not just because he misses the spotlight. he possibly sees a new white house bid as a shield against possible indictment in several criminal probes. ""i will probably have to do it again,"" trump told supporters at a rally in texas last month, referring to the possibility of his third presidential campaign, which would be rooted in his still-high popularity in the republican party but could founder on his far more uncertain standing among a broader general electorate. american presidents defeated after only one term have generally faded pretty fast into history. trump would need to emulate a feat achieved only once before, by president grover cleveland, who lost the election of 1888 only to return to the white house after exacting revenge on president benjamin harrison after his victory four years later. the art of the political comeback israel's netanyahu, one of trump's closest friends on the international stage, would love to get the band back together with trump. on tuesday, the former prime minister, first elected in 1996 and who has dominated israeli politics for much of the last quarter century, was on the verge of a stunning second comeback, as initial exit polls suggested he may have won a narrow majority in yet another election in a nation politically split down the middle. and on sunday in brazil, lula da silva, who's known as ""lula,"" narrowly defeated president jair bolsonaro in a runoff election. while trump probably would have preferred the opposite result since bolsonaro is something of a protégé, the leftist former leader's win showed that former presidents can have second acts. lula da silva, a former two-term president of brazil, has, like trump, had his run-ins with legal authorities. in fact, his long and winding road to a political return detoured through a partial jail term for alleged corruption. the supreme court's annulment of his sentences cleared him to run again. there had been fears that bolsonaro would emulate his us alter ego and fellow covid-19 mask rejectionist by refusing to accept the result of an election that tipped him out of power after only a single term. but while he hasn't conceded, the man known as ""the trump of the tropics"" says he'll respect the constitution and hasn't so far resorted to inciting an insurrection to try to keep his job. but he's unlikely to go away: he lost the election by the narrowest of margins, his political movement is still strong -- and, like trump, he may be looking to the future. bolsonaro and lula da silva aren't the only blasts from the past who've tried to pave a way back to power. in italy, three-time former prime minister silvio berlusconi is back in parliament after a tax fraud scandal, though his attempt to play kingmaker in coalition talks dissolved after he boasted about his ties with old friend russian president vladimir putin, who just happens to be a hero to trump as well. like lula da silva and bolsonaro, trump enjoys fervent support from loyalist supporters who aren't dissuaded by their run-ins with the law. lula da silva emerged from jail as a hero to his followers, one-and-a-half years into a 12-year sentence for corruption and money laundering imposed in 2018. netanyahu, however, is still embroiled in his corruption trial and faces one charge of bribery and three charges of fraud and breach of trust in three separate investigations. he has adopted a distinctly trumpian approach to his plight -- slamming the investigations as a ""witch hunt"" and an ""attempted coup"" and, like the former us president, has raised doubts about the legitimacy of the judiciary. as he travels the world, president joe biden has been telling allies that ""america is back"" or, in other words, that the disruptive trump administration that alienated allies and saw the american president cozy up to dictators, is over. yet many foreign diplomats -- as they observe the vitriol and division in the united states and trump's strength with his base, not to mention the state-level candidates he's elevated this year who could oversee the 2024 election -- wonder how long they can bank on the more traditional, multilateral brand of stable us leadership biden is trying to restore. even if trump doesn't run in 2024, the power of his movement is so strong in the gop that a possible future republican president would likely share his populist, nationalist, ""america first"" instincts. the comeback that failed still, the comeback trail is not always kind to populist leaders who have fallen from power. ex-british prime minister boris johnson just saw his attempt to win back 10 downing street foiled after the short, but disastrous premiership of his successor liz truss. johnson -- once referred to as ""britain trump"" by the former us president -- last month failed to persuade sufficient conservative mps to reelect him as their leader and, therefore under the british system, as prime minister. the chaos, scandals and mismanagement of johnson's premiership featured partying in downing street when the rest of the country was being told to observe strict covid-19 protocols. conservative mps opted instead for former finance minister rishi sunak, who has only been in power for a week but is already finding out what many observers believe to be the case -- that the conservative party is ungovernable. johnson, like trump, isn't ready to cede the limelight. on tuesday, he told sky news that he planned to attend the cop27 climate summit in egypt later this month. he made the announcement after sunak said he wouldn't attend owing to the demands of salvaging the british economy. but on wednesday, the sitting prime minister tweeted that he would indeed go to the conference -- amid suggestions he didn't want to be overshadowed by one of his predecessors. johnson, unlike trump, did not get defeated in a general election. instead, his colleagues decided he was an electoral liability, which is very different from how the gop has treated trump. johnson still believes he has a mandate to rule, given the landslide election win he masterminded in december 2019 -- and it's a safe bet he'd be ready to pounce if sunak founders. johnson's hero is winston churchill, the original political comeback kid who endured years in the political wilderness before his country turned to him for leadership in its darkest hour in world war ii. after his shock defeat in the 1945 election, the great briton didn't go away either: he returned to 10 downing street as prime minister six years later.",3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.5797397680580616,0.08201560967912276,0.33824461698532104,-0.33333327674438074,0,0,0,0,-0.9999998302331422,0.944434315201624,48.0,0.019675714900033833
Netanyahu on brink of comeback as Israeli exit polls point to narrow majority for ex-PM,2022-11-01,56.0,"former israeli leader benjamin netanyahu was on the verge of making a triumphant return to office in israel, as initial exit polls suggested he may have scraped a narrow majority in the country's fifth national election in less than four years. if exit polls are correct -- a big if -- netanyahu and his political allies appear to be on pace to win most seats in the knesset, israel's parliament. as expected, first exit polls from the country's three main broadcasters suggested late on tuesday that no party won enough seats to govern on its own, meaning that it will be necessary to build a coalition government. the exit polls projected pro-netanyahu parties would take 61 or 62 of the parliament's 120 seats. the alliance is comprised of netanyahu's likud party, religious zionism/jewish power, shas and united torah judaism. the alliance backing the current acting prime minister yair lapid, comprised of yesh atid, national unity, yisrael beiteinu, labor, meretz and ra'am, was poised to take 54 or 55 seats, according to the exit polls. the arab party hadash/taal, which is unlikely to support either side, was set to secure four seats, the exit polls suggested. the election was marked by the highest turnout since 2015. the central election committee said 71.3% of eligible voters cast their ballots, which was more than in any of the last four elections that produced stalemates or short-lived governments. netanyahu spent the closing weeks of the campaign barnstorming the country in a truck converted into a travelling stage encased in bulletproof glass. pro-netanyahu ads -- and ads depicting his opponents looking shady -- plastered the sides of buses. it's not yet certain that netanyahu has made a comeback, after he was outmaneuvered following last year's elections by lapid. the exit polls are only projections based on interviews with voters on tuesday, not official results. the results can -- and have in the past -- change throughout the election night. official results may not be final until wednesday or even thursday. once official results are in, president isaac herzog will invite the politician he deems most likely to be able to form a government to open coalition negotiations. a netanyahu return to the head of government could spell fundamental shifts to israeli society. a netanyahu government would almost certainly include the newly ascendant jewish nationalist religious zionism/jewish power alliance, whose leaders include itamar ben gvir, once convicted for inciting racism and supporting terrorism. if the exit polls turn out to be correct, the far-right alliance would more than double its representation in the knesset. the grouping had six seats in the outgoing parliament; exit polls project that they have won 14 or 15 seats this time around. when asked by cnn on tuesday about fears he would lead a far-right government if he returns to office, netanyahu responded with an apparent reference to the ra'am party, which made history last year by becoming the first arab party ever to join an israeli government coalition. ""we don't want a government with the muslim brotherhood, who support terrorism, deny the existence of israel and are pretty hostile to the united states. that is what we are going to bring,"" netanyahu told cnn in english at his polling station in jerusalem. and netanyahu allies have talked about making changes to the judicial system. that could put an end to netanyahu's own corruption trial, where he has pleaded not guilty. netanyahu himself has been one of the main issues not only in tuesday's election but in the four that preceded it, with voters -- and politicians -- splitting into camps based on whether they want the man universally known as bibi in power or not. part of the difficulty in building a stable government over the past four elections has been that even some political parties that agree with netanyahu on the issues refuse to work with him for personal or political reasons of their own. coalition building regardless of whether the exit polls are correct or not, they are only exit polls, not official results. getting the official results is going to take some time -- they could be ready as soon as wednesday, but it might be thursday before the final makeup of israel's 25th knesset is clear. that's partly because parties need to win at least 3.25% of the total vote in order to get any seats in the knesset at all, a threshold established in an effort to make coalition building easier by keeping very small parties out of the legislature. to determine how many seats each party gets, election officials first need to determine which parties crossed the threshold. then they can work out how many votes it takes to win a single knesset seat, and dole out seats to the parties based on the number of votes they got. that's the point where the real wheeling and dealing begins. there's a slim chance that even if the election results look like a deadlock, a clever negotiator can pull a surprise coalition together, the way lapid did last year. on the other hand, even if on paper, it looks like one leader or another has the backing to form a majority government, they'll still need to cajole the smaller parties into coalition agreements. and those smaller parties will have demands -- control of particular ministries, funding for projects or programs important to their constituents, bringing in new laws or getting rid of old ones. potential prime ministers will need to balance out the competing demands of rival coalition partners, each one of whom knows that they hold the keys to putting a head of government into office. and whoever becomes prime minister -- if anyone does -- will face the same problems. the cost of living is skyrocketing in israel as in so many other places, with energy and grocery bills spiking. an israel democracy institute poll this summer found that a party's economic platform was far and away the factor most often named as a reason for choosing who to vote for. nearly half (44%) of israeli voters said it was the most important factor, well ahead of the quarter (24%) who said party leader was the determiner. any new prime minister will also need to confront the conflict between israel and the palestinian militias that has claimed more lives on both sides this year than any time since 2015. the israel defense forces have been carrying out frequent raids for months into the occupied west bank -- particularly jenin and nablus -- saying they are trying to apprehend known attackers and seize weapons. as a strategy, it does not seem to have reduced the level of violence: at least one israeli civilian was shot and killed near hebron in the west bank on saturday, and others were wounded in the same incident -- as were two medics who responded, one israeli and one palestinian. a day later, a palestinian man rammed his car into five israeli soldiers near jericho. both palestinian attackers were killed, in a cycle of violence that the new prime minister will need to deal with -- if, indeed, there is a new prime minister as a result of tuesday's vote.",15.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.39444981946920354,0.2901954110711813,0.31535476432181897,-0.02017164243266661,0,0,0,0,-0.30257463648999916,1.520768751082623,53.0,0.02869375002042685
Netanyahu eyes comeback as Israel votes in fifth election in four years,2022-11-01,57.0,"israelis are heading to the ballot box for an unprecedented fifth time in four years on tuesday, as israel holds yet another national election aimed at ending the country's ongoing political deadlock. for the first time in 13 years, former prime minister benjamin netanyahu is not running as the incumbent. bibi, as he is universally known in israel, is hoping to return to power as the head of a hard-right coalition, while centrist caretaker prime minister yair lapid is hoping the mantle of the acting premiership will help keep him in place. netanyahu issued a stark warning as he cast his ballot on tuesday morning. when asked by cnn about fears he would lead a far-right government if returns to office, netanyahu responded with an apparent reference to the ra'am party, which made history last year by becoming the first arab party ever to join an israeli government coalition. ""we don't want a government with the muslim brotherhood, who support terrorism, deny the existence of israel and are pretty hostile to the united states. that is what we are going to bring,"" netanyahu told cnn in english, at his polling station in jerusalem. lapid, who hopes he and his political allies will defy polling predictions and remain in power, cast his ballot in tel aviv on tuesday with a message to voters: ""good morning, vote wisely. vote for the state of israel, the future of our children and our future in general."" the name of lapid's party, yesh atid, means ""there is a future."" the country was on track to have its highest voter turnout in an election since 1999. turnout was 47.5% by mid-afternoon, the central election committee said, more than five points higher than it was at the same time in the last vote. there had been a strong get-out-the-vote effort ahead of tuesday, with netanyahu barnstorming the country in a converted truck turned into a bulletproof travelling stage, and arab parties urging arab citizens to vote to keep netanyahu out. but if the final opinion polls are on target, it seems unlikely that this round of voting will be any more successful in clearing the logjam than the last four. those polls project that netanyahu's bloc will fall one seat short of a majority in parliament. just like in the previous four elections, netanyahu himself -- and the possibility of a government led by him -- is one of the defining issues, especially as his corruption trial continues. a poll by the israel democracy institute (idi) in august found a quarter of respondents said the identity of the party leader they were voting for was the second most important factor in their vote. but some top politicians on the center-right, who agree with him ideologically, refuse to work with him for personal or political reasons. so, in order to make a comeback, netanyahu, leader of the center-right likud party, is likely going to depend on the support of extreme right-wing parties to form a coalition -- and if successful, may be forced to give their leaders ministerial positions. israelis are also very concerned about cost of living, after seeing their utility and grocery bills shoot up this year. in the same idi poll, 44% said their first priority was what a party's economic plan would do to mitigate the cost of living. and security, always a major issue in israeli politics, is on voters' minds -- 2022 has been the worst year in for conflict-related deaths for both israelis and palestinians since 2015. bibi on a knife edge a recent compilation of polls put together by haaretz shows that netanyahu's bloc of parties is likely to either come up just shy of -- or just reach -- the 61 seats needed to form a majority in the government, while the bloc led by lapid falls short by around four to five seats. according to pollsters joshua hantman and simon davies, the last week of polling saw a small bump for netanyahu's bloc, showing it passing the 61-seat mark in six polls, and falling short in nine. the final three polls published on friday by the three major israeli news channels, all showed his bloc at 60 seats in the 120-seat knesset. recognizing the need to eke out just one or two more seats, netanyahu has been focusing his campaigning in places that are strongholds for likud. party officials have previously claimed that hundreds of thousands of likely netanyahu voters didn't vote. another major factor is the arab turnout. citizens who identify as arab and have national voting rights make up around 17% of the israeli population, according to idi; their turnout could make or break netanyahu's chances. one of the parties, the united arab list, has warned if arab turnout falls below 48%, some of the arab parties could fail to pass the 3.25% vote threshold needed to gain any seats in parliament. the voting environment along with soaring grocery and utility bills and a nearly impossible housing market, tuesday's vote takes place against the backdrop of an increasingly tense security environment. earlier this year, a wave of attacks targeting israelis killed 19 people, including mass attacks targeting civilians in tel aviv and other cities in israel. there has also been a surge in armed assaults on israeli troops and civilian settlers by palestinian militants in the occupied west bank this year, claiming the lives of several more soldiers and israeli civilians. according to the israel defense forces, there have been at least 180 shooting incidents in israel and the occupied territories this year, compared to 61 shooting attacks in 2021. in the days leading up to election day, an israeli man was killed and several injured in a shooting attack in the west bank near hebron. the next day, several soldiers were injured in a car ramming attack near the west bank city of jericho. the palestinian attackers were killed in both cases. israeli settler attacks against palestinians in the west bank -- and sometimes on israeli soldiers -- are also on the rise, according to the human rights group b'tselem. near-daily israeli security raids in west bank cities have killed more than 130 palestinians this year. while the israeli military says most were militants or palestinians violently engaging with them -- including the newly formed 'lion's den' militia -- unarmed and uninvolved civilians have been caught up as well. the death of al jazeera correspondent shireen abu akleh in may while covering an israeli military raid in the west bank caught worldwide attention. after several months the israeli military admitted it was most likely their own soldiers who shot abu akleh -- saying it was an unintentional killing in the midst of a combat zone. palestinian disillusionment with their own leadership's ability to confront the israeli occupation has led to a proliferation of these new militias -- and a fear among experts that a third palestinian intifada, or uprising, is on the way. how does voting and forming a government work? there are 40 political parties on the ballot, although only around a dozen parties are expected to pass the threshold to sit in the parliament. immediately after polls close at 10 p.m. local time (4 p.m. et), the major media networks release exit polls that give the first glimpse of how the vote went -- although the official vote tally can vary from exit polls, often by small but crucial amounts. only a dozen or so parties are expected to pass the minimum threshold of votes needed to sit in parliament. once the vote is officially tallied, israeli president isaac herzog will hand the mandate to form a government to the leader he considers most likely to succeed -- even if they're not the leader of the largest party. that candidate then has a total of 42 days to try and corral enough parties to reach the magic number of 61 seats of the 120-seat knesset, the israeli parliament, to form a majority government. if they fail, the president can transfer the mandate to another candidate. if that person fails within 28 days, then the mandate goes back to the parliament which has 21 days to find a candidate, a last chance before new elections are triggered. lapid would stay on as caretaker prime minister until a new government is formed.

Netanyahu eyes extremist political support in comeback attempt,2022-10-28,58.0,"when benjamin netanyahu hits the campaign trail, he uses what's been dubbed the bibimobile -- a converted truck turned into a travelling stage ensconced in bulletproof glass. elevated like a king above his subjects --- who fawn over him as the one and only savior to lead israel. and with polls showing netanyahu's block of parties falling short of the needed 61-seat majority to form a government, the former prime minister has been taking the bibi show around israel to try and shore up every last one of his supporters ahead of the november 1 elections. at a campaign stop last week in kiryat malachi, netanyahu tells supporters from the bibimobile: ""don't be despondent, be turbocharged. bring everybody at home and tell them this time don't stay at home -- go and vote."" for the first time in more than 12 years, netanyahu has been campaigning from the outside -- as opposition leader. after four elections in three years failed to bring about a stable government, netanyahu was toppled from his perch as the longest-serving prime minister by naftali bennett and current caretaker prime minister yair lapid, who formed an unlikely coalition of diverse parties. their coalition -- made up of parties from the right wing to the left, and, for the first time, an arab party -- had consensus on few issues but all agreed netanyahu needed to be out. but ultimately it was their diversity -- and a few rebellious members -- that brought about the coalition's downfall and now, israel's fifth election in less than four years. netanyahu's potential path back to power is a narrow one. the same political leaders who refused to work with him after the 2021 election -- even if they fell into the same center-right ideological camp as netanyahu -- don't seem any more likely to support him this year. that means netanyahu will have to rely on parties further to the right in order to build a coalition, and the resulting government could reshape israeli laws and society in a way no israeli government has done before. polls suggest no bloc has a clear majority that could form a ruling government -- but netanyahu's likud party looks like it will be the biggest single party in the knesset. campaign advertisements on buses show netanyahu pointing at the viewer, saying the path to the majority ""is up to you!"" netanyahu has been campaigning on the policies he championed when he was in power: safety and security, preventing iran from getting a nuclear weapon, supporting jewish settlements in the west bank, maintaining israel's military deterrence against enemies, and, in these tough economic times, reducing the cost of living. but he himself may be the single biggest election issue. his supporters -- acting more like fans at a sporting event -- eat it up. one of them, jumping in front of the cnn camera, yells ""bibi is king of israel! all people in the world is afraid of bibi because the man is strong."" and, it's whether or not voters are afraid of what netanyahu will do that will determine how they vote. ""we're not talking about the future of the israeli palestinian conflict. we're not really talking about cost of living, though israel, like every other country is facing its own cost of living crisis,"" said anshel pfeffer, the economist and haaretz correspondent who wrote a 2018 biography of netanyahu called ""bibi: the turbulent life and times of benjamin netanyahu."" ""we're not talking about any other policy issue really, beyond netanyahu and what netanyahu will do on the day after the election,"" he said. a chance to quash the trials he's also talking about reforming the judiciary. despite the ongoing campaign, netanyahu is still in the midst of his corruption trial -- where he faces one charge of bribery and three charges of fraud and breach of trust in three separate corruption investigations. netanyahu has pleaded not guilty and called his ongoing corruption trial a ""witch hunt"" and an ""attempted coup"" and has called for changes to israel's judiciary system. yohanan plesner, a former member of the israeli parliament and the president of the israel democracy institute, said that if netanyahu comes back to power, his first focus will be on using his majority to put a stop to the trial. ""his energy and focus will be on his trial, on eroding and undermining the independence, the independence of the judiciary, perhaps firing the attorney general, those kinds of maneuvers that will allow him to free himself from the legal process that he's facing,"" plesner said. plesner said the israeli public's debate about the future of netanyahu is ""entangled with a major debate about the features of israeli democracy, how israeli democracy should look like and the independence of the judiciary ... the very nature and fundamental characteristics of our democracy."" one of netanyahu's likely coalition allies, right-wing religious zionist leader bezalel smotrich, has proposed a series of drastic legal reforms, seen by many critics as a clear way to undercut judicial independence, including dropping the ability to charge a public servant with fraud and breach of trust -- a charge netanyahu faces in his current trial. asked about the proposal by cnn's fareed zakaria, netanyahu demurred and said, ""i wouldn't do anything that affects me. i think my trial is unraveling as it is."" extremists with power much of netanyahu's support in a future government would need to come from the extreme right wing. the coalition would include a new joint group led by smotrich and itamar ben gvir, an extremist who has been convicted for supporting terrorism and inciting racism. he was known for hanging in his home a portrait of the israeli man who massacred 29 palestinians in 1994 before being beaten to death himself. in 2020, ben gvir tweeted he would take the portrait down, ahead of the elections, ""...for the sake of unity and the victory of the right,"" he said. earlier this month, ben gvir inflamed already sky-high tensions in the flashpoint jerusalem neighborhood of sheikh jarrah by pulling a gun during clashes between israelis and palestinians, yelling at police to shoot arabs who were throwing stones. but polls show smotrich and ben gvir's joint party on the rise and could garner more than a dozen seats in the 120-seat knesset -- a showing many israelis thought unfathomable just a few years ago -- becoming a key pillar of netanyahu's comeback attempt, and power. plesner said netanyahu would once have ""never dreamt of including such an extreme figure in his government,"" but now he may need to appoint the once outcast ben gvir to a ministerial position. ""now he has no choice. the more moderate israeli politicians do not want anything to do with mr. netanyahu. and therefore he built partnerships [with] these really extreme right. we might expect to see ben gvir in the government. what kind of portfolio? what power will you have beyond a provocations and populism?"" plesner said. pfeffer told cnn that these extremists will extract a price from netanyahu -- that may include showing more favors towards west bank settlers. ""the question is, what is the price that the far right is going to extricate from him? .... perhaps some settlements in the west bank which were in the past abandoned by israel, will be rebuilt, reoccupied?"" pfeffer said. ""and perhaps further steps towards some type of annexation in the west bank?"" all are moves that would likely inflame and escalate tensions with the palestinians. just last year netanyahu said ben gvir wasn't fit to serve in the cabinet. but earlier this month, netanyahu reversed himself, when asked if ben gvir would be a minister in his government. ""he certainly can, anyone can,"" he said. but moshe klughaft, an international political strategist who used to work with netanyahu, said he doesn't think the former pm will take extreme steps because a government with the likes of ben gvir will collapse quickly. ""he will not do significant movements like applying (sovereignty over) the territories or something like this. netanyahu's strategy is work for the short term, and then for another short term and another short term and not for the long term,"" klughaft told cnn. ""so now he wants to win the elections, to gain 61 (seats). after this, he will want to establish a government and after this, i think he will want to go to another election as a caretaker prime minister."" in his interview with cnn's zakaria, netanyahu denied that the extremists will have any power. ""i've had such partners in the past, and they didn't change an iota of my policies. i decide the policy with my party, which is the largest party by far in the country. and we are a center-right party and a responsible party, but we are not going to adopt norms for the government that we don't agree with,"" netanyahu said. but before he can decline such policy ideas, he'll need to claw his way back to power, one parliamentary seat at a time. iran protests government supporters demonstrated outside the british embassy in tehran to protest the uk government's ""role"" in recent unrest in iran, state-aligned news agency tasnim said on thursday. tasnim said the student protesters accuse the uk of supporting bbc persian and iran international, networks that they say encourage anti-government demonstrations across the country. ""in recent weeks, several channels including iran international, manoto, bbc and radiofarda have been officially teaching guerilla warfare and battle tactics"" and ""have formed a kind of media terrorism,"" tasnim said. here's the latest on this developing story: germany's foreign ministry invited the iranian ambassador to a meeting in berlin on thursday after the german ambassador was summoned in tehran in response to ""interventionist positions."" amnesty international said on thursday that iran's security forces killed at least eight people in less than 24 hours after opening fire ""on mourners and protesters in at least four provinces."" cnn cannot independently verify the death toll. mourners gathering near the village of veysian to commemorate the 40th day since the death of nika shahkarami, a 16-year-old protester who went missing on september 20, were met with gunfire and tear gas by security forces, according to video posted on social media and geolocated by cnn. read: what really happened to nika shahkarami? witnesses to her final hours cast doubt on iran's story the digest iran's khamenei vows revenge after deadly attack on shrine iran's supreme leader promised on thursday to retaliate against those threatening the country's security after the massacre of shiite pilgrims, an assault claimed by isis that threatens to inflame tensions amid widespread anti-government protests.

Gulf states use new oil riches to gain regional influence,2022-10-31,59.0,"big gulf arab oil states are using the newfound riches they've reaped as a result of the ukraine war to build economic bridges with their poorer neighbors, some of whom they once considered adversaries. the monarchies are now doubling down on economic cooperation. at the heart of this diplomatic initiative are sovereign wealth funds, which are working to secure regional stability through billions of dollars' worth of investments. saudi arabia and the united arab emirates -- both of which are generating massive returns from this year's oil price hikes -- are taking the lead with such investments, entrenching themselves in countries that have faced unrest in part because of economic distress. middle eastern energy exporters, including gulf countries, are expected to see a windfall of around $1 trillion dollars over the next four years on the back of this year's oil boom, said the international monetary fund (imf) last week. ""money talks,"" michael maduell, president of the sovereign wealth fund institute in las vegas, told cnn. ""sovereign wealth funds can be used as foreign policy tools, a sort of soft power."" after almost a decade of a combative regional policy, saudi arabia and the uae are moving towards a less confrontational approach. both have mended ties with regional foes turkey and qatar, and both have reached out to iran. they have also significantly reduced their military activity in yemen, where they went to war seven years ago. analysts say this is a new approach to ensure regional stability, mainly by bolstering key economies across the middle east through investments that are closely tied to their funders. ""the current structure is certainly an evolution from days where hard power was viewed as more productive,"" said ayham kamel, head of eurasia group's middle east and north africa research team. saudi arabia's de facto ruler, crown prince mohammed bin salman, last week announced that the nation's wealth fund, the public investment fund (pif), is establishing five regional companies worth $24 billion across the middle east. from infrastructure and real estate development to telecoms and technology, pif's new investments target bahrain, iraq, oman, jordan, sudan and egypt. some of these countries experienced political upheaval when the 2011 arab spring uprisings rocked the region more than a decade ago. others are still wedged in the economic and political chaos left behind. ""this is part of the soft and sticky power aspect of the strategic and tactical move away from a decade of confrontation and conflict initiated by the arab spring,"" said hussein ibish, a senior resident scholar at the arab gulf states institute in washington. ""the countries that projected power in the middle east, including saudi arabia and the uae -- with the partial exception of iran -- found themselves overextended and to some extent exhausted after a decade of confrontation,"" he told cnn. pif's announcement came on the second day of the future investment initiative in riyadh. in a statement, pif said that it was pursuing a ""strategy of seeking new investment opportunities in the mena region."" the investments are also meant to ""diversify saudi arabia's sources of revenue,"" it added. last year was generally good for state-owned investors around the world, according to global swf's 2022 annual report, with the size of the sovereign wealth fund industry expanding by 6% in 2021 and for the first time in history exceeding the $10 trillion mark. the uae's wealth funds in particular are at the forefront of the industry. the gulf state manages around $1.3 trillion through its four funds, said global swf. one of the key regional investment destinations for both abu dhabi and riyadh has been egypt. a north african state with pinching economic troubles, egypt erupted in nationwide protests in 2011, leading to the fall of longtime ruler hosni mubarak. to gulf states' dismay, the events that followed briefly gave rise to the muslim brotherhood, an islamist political group that is viewed with suspicion in saudi arabia and the uae and is now considered a terrorist organization by both. egypt's unrest more than a decade ago was sparked partly by the nation's economic woes. today, the egyptian currency is again falling in value and inflation is soaring as authorities try to keep the economy afloat by securing loans from the international monetary fund (imf). in august, abu dhabi developmental holding company (adq), one of the emirate's wealth funds, announced a number of investments in publicly listed companies in egypt, ""building on its long-term commitment to investing in the country's economic growth through its $20 billion joint strategic investment platform,"" it said in a statement. saudi arabia's pif also launched the saudi egyptian investment company (seic) in august, a company dedicated to investments in several vital sectors of the egyptian economy. seic has bought $1.3 billion dollars' worth of stakes in four egyptian companies. gulf monarchies' financial diplomatic hand has already proven effective in some countries. once a regional rival, turkey is now an economic ally of saudi arabia and the uae. ""even with adversaries, the gulf states now see their financial assets as potentially important levers in building bridges and incentivizing more moderate policies in these countries,"" said kamel. ""rapprochement with turkey has come with valuable investments or financial injections."" facing a grueling currency crisis at home, mending ties with saudi arabia and the uae comes at an opportune time for ankara. last year, the uae established a $10 billion dollar investment fund to ""support the turkish economy and boost the bilateral cooperation between the two countries."" a number of other agreements between the uae's adq and the turkey wealth fund (twf) also followed, with major investments planned in venture capital and companies with high-growth potential in turkey. and this month, saudi minister of commerce majid bin abdullah al-qasabi said that his country's investments in turkey now amount to $18 billion, according to the saudi gazette, adding that pif is looking at further investment opportunities there. despite a political thaw, gulf investments in iran and syria are unlikely for the time being, say analysts. but there are signs of a growing economic relationship with them. iran and the uae are targeting $30 billion in annual trade within the next two years from $20 billion this year, the tehran times reported. earlier this year, syrian tv reported that the uae is weighing investments in the country, without providing details. but those kinds of economic partnerships may go a long way in helping shield gulf nations from future unrest and conflict with their neighbors. ""infrastructure integration,"" says ibish, can help ""reduce the risk of conflict by creating mutual interests and interdependency,"" giving countries strong incentives to avoid confrontation. iran protests the head of iran's elite revolutionary guards hossein salami called on iranians to stop protesting, warning that saturday would be their ""last day"" of protest. speaking from the funeral of victims of the attack carried out by isis in the city of shiraz on wednesday, salami, called on iranian youth specifically to desist protesting. ""today is the last day of the riots. do not come to the streets again. what do you want from this nation?,"" salami said. despite salami's warning, the protests have continued. iran has been gripped by weeks of of public demonstrations since the death of 22-year-old iranian woman mahsa amini in morality police custody. here's the latest: violent clashes broke out between security forces and student protestors at university campuses across iran on sunday, according to iranian activist and human rights groups. more than 300 iranian journalists released a statement on sunday calling for the release of colleagues niloofar hamedi and elaheh mohammadi, who were arrested and sent to tehran's evin prison for covering the death of mahsa amini, according to independent iranian newspaper etemad. renowned music group coldplay performed iranian singer shervin hajipour's viral song ""baraye"" along with iranian singer, actress and activist golshifteh farahani in front of thousands of fans at a live concert friday night in buenos aires, argentina. the digest president aoun leaves office as lebanon's crisis worsens michel aoun, the 89-year-old christian president who presided over lebanon's financial meltdown and the deadly beirut port blast, vacated the presidential palace on sunday, leaving a void at the top of the lebanese state, reuters reported. background: lebanon's parliament has so far been unable to agree on a successor in the role, which has the power to sign bills into law, appoint new prime ministers and green-light government formations before they are voted on by parliament. parliament has convened four times to try to elect a successor but no candidate has won a majority. why it matters: that leaves lebanon in the unprecedented situation of having a presidential vacuum and a caretaker cabinet with limited powers, as the premier-designate has been unable to form a government for six months. in an interview with reuters a day before his departure, aoun said lebanon was sliding into ""constitutional chaos,"" given the lack of clarity over what prerogatives the caretaker cabinet and the parliament would each have. netanyahu projected to fall just short of majority in israel elections former israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and his allies are projected to fall one seat short of a majority in elections, the final opinion polls published before tuesday's voting suggest. three different polls for the three main television broadcasters all projected that the pro-netanyahu bloc would win 60 seats in the 120-seat knesset. netanyahu's main opponent, acting prime minister yair lapid, is also projected to fall short of a majority, winning 56 seats. background: the polls were released by channel 11, 12 and 13 late on friday -- the last day, by law, when opinion polling for the november 1 election can be published. the remaining four seats are projected to go to an arab grouping called hadash/taal, which is not likely to support either a netanyahu- or lapid-led government, or be invited to do so. why it matters: israel is set to have its fifth election in four years. but if the final pre-election polls are anything to go by, tuesday's vote could fail to break the political logjam that has paralyzed the country. turkey says it will try to keep black sea grain initiative alive turkish president recep tayyip erdogan on monday told an audience that ankara is determined to try and keep the black sea grain initiative alive despite moscow's withdrawal. backgr",4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.39440050411171146,0.38653388874871386,0.17620846651095365,-0.3384851260928937,0,0,0,0,-1.3539405043715749,-12.857062102205173,67.0,-0.19189644928664437
Five elections in four years: What's the deal with Israeli politics?,2022-10-30,60.0,"stop us if you're heard this one before: on tuesday, israelis are going to the polls to elect a new knesset, or parliament. it's the fifth time in less than four years that voters are casting ballots. holding elections that often is bound to prompt some questions. here are some answers. why does israel have elections so often? israel has a parliamentary system made up of several parties -- none of which have ever received enough votes on their own to secure a majority of seats in parliament. that means parties must team up to form coalitions and reach the 61 seats needed to form a ruling government. those coalitions can also be shaky -- lose one party's support, or sometimes even one member of parliament, and you've lost the majority. the other factor is benjamin netanyahu. he served as prime minister for longer than anyone else in israeli history, is in the midst of a corruption trial, and overall is a polarizing figure. some top politicians on the center-right, who agree with him ideologically, refuse to work with him for personal or political reasons. that made it difficult for him to build lasting governing majorities following the previous four elections, and last year, his opponents managed to cobble together a never-before-seen coalition of parties from across the political spectrum to keep him out of power. but that coalition only held together for about a year and a quarter before its leaders, yair lapid and naftali bennett, pulled the plug and called for new elections. who are the main contenders this time around? netanyahu's center-right likud party will almost certainly be the largest party in the knesset after tuesday's vote, if the polls are correct. they'll probably win about 30 seats, a quarter of the total, a compilation of polls by haaretz, for example, suggests. current prime minister yair lapid will be hoping his centrist yesh atid party will come in a strong second place. the man he partnered with to assemble the last government, naftali bennett, is not running this time around; his party has splintered and faces a potential electoral wipeout. defense minister benny gantz is aiming for a strong showing at the head of a new party called national unity, a successor to his blue and white party which now includes former bennett ally gideon saar and former israel defense forces chief of staff gadi eisenkot, making his political debut. a far-right coalition called the religious zionist party, headed by bezalel smotrich and itamar ben gvir, could be the largest extreme right-wing group ever seated in the knesset. on the other hand, the once-mighty labor party and its predecessors, which governed israel essentially as a one-party state for its first 30 years under david ben-gurion and his successors, is a shadow of its former self, and is projected to win only a handful of seats. how does the election work? israel is a parliamentary democracy, where people vote for the party they support. each party that gets at least 3.25% of the popular vote gets a certain number of seats in the knesset based on the percentage of the total number of votes it won. the 3.25% threshold is intended to keep very small parties out of the knesset, an attempt to make it easier to build governing coalitions. israel has experimented in the past with electing the prime minister directly, separate from the knesset, the way the us elects the president and congress separately. it proved unwieldy and the country went back to standard parliamentary elections. what's expected to happen? the final polls suggest that netanyahu's party and its potential allies are hovering right around the knife edge number of 60 seats and the drama of election night will be whether the former pm scrapes above it. if his bloc clearly wins a majority, his path to building a government is clear and he will return to power. if the pro-netanyahu bloc falls below 61 seats, things are more complicated. netanyahu would still probably have the first chance to form a government if his likud party is the biggest in the knesset, which could result in days or weeks of negotiations that go nowhere. if he fails, president isaac herzog can then decide to give the mandate to current acting prime minister lapid, or to another lawmaker whom herzog calculates may have the best chance to form a government. that could mean no one can build a majority government, raising the possibility of ... more elections. while party negotiations are taking place and until a new government is formed, lapid remains in place as caretaker prime minister. what are the key issues for israeli voters? israelis are concerned about many of the same issues that people around the world are -- the cost of living in particular. they are also always focused on security. in the region, iran's nuclear ambitions and support of militant groups are always a worry, and more locally, violence is high this year between israelis and palestinians. some constituencies have their own specific concerns, such as the ultra-orthodox, who want state support for their institutions and exemptions from army service; and religious zionists, who want backing for west bank settlements. but overwhelmingly, israeli elections these days are about one issue and one man: benjamin netanyahu. correction: this article has been updated to remove an incorrect reference to which arab party supported yair lapid's government, and to better explain how lapid could get the mandate to form a new one.

The world leaders who refuse to leave the stage,2022-10-27,61.0,"george washington knew when to cede power. but many of today's global leaders find it much harder to leave the stage — and could do with a dose of the first us president's humility. some have no desire to quit. others are desperate to claw back the clout they once had. the result is an era of stasis in already repressive nations like russia and china, and déjà vu in democracies where ex-leaders seem to be putting narcissistic considerations above national interests. ""i will probably have to do it again,"" said former president donald trump — he of the two impeachments and the us capitol insurrection — to supporters baying for a second term this weekend. boris johnson (once referred to as ""britain trump"" by the ex-potus) just mounted his own comeback bid and failed —though anyone who thinks he's given up on emulating his hero winston churchill, who returned as prime minister six years after losing the 1945 election, is surely mistaken. democracy is hanging by a thread in brazil, where president jair bolsonaro has hinted he may not accept defeat in his quest for a second term in this weekend's run-off vote. his rival is another retread — luiz inácio lula da silva, the former two-time president known as ""lula"" whose return to the spotlight detoured through a partial jail term (his conviction was later annulled). some of the current comeback kids have been on the world stage since the 1990s. in italy, three-time former prime minister silvio berlusconi is back in parliament after a tax fraud scandal, though his attempt to play kingmaker in coalition talks dissolved after he boasted about his ties with old friend russian president vladimir putin. another scandal-prone leader trying to recapture past glories is benjamin netanyahu, who served so long as prime minister that they dubbed him ""king bibi."" he is leading in the polls ahead of yet another israeli general election. of course, one alternative to making a comeback is never going away. putin himself has been in power since december 31, 1999 — though had to spin a scam in which he was ""demoted"" to prime minister for a number of years as the power behind the throne before returning as president. and in china, xi jinping just cemented a norm-busting third term in office. exhausted after two terms, and disillusioned by bitter, partisan politics, washington passed on a third term in office in 1796. he told americans that he was ""persuaded, whatever partiality may be retained for my services, that in the present circumstances of our country you will not disapprove my determination to retire."" not words you hear very often these days.",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.9296147690878974,0.007897222673313485,0.006932425416178173,-0.9444444444444444,0,0,0,0,-0.9444444444444444,-10.499605333470422,56.0,-0.18749295238340039
5 ways the Israel-Lebanon maritime deal matters,2022-10-12,62.0,"amid decades of hostility, lebanon and israel on tuesday reached a historic maritime border deal, finally demarcating a disputed area in the mediterranean sea that is believed to be rich in oil and gas. the deal opens doors to exploration and drilling when gas prices are skyrocketing amid a global supply crunch stemming from russia's invasion of ukraine. still technically at war, lebanon and israel both have much to gain from the deal. from income relief peering over the horizon for an economically shattered lebanon, to a vital win for israel's yair lapid government ahead of next month's elections, the agreement should bear fruit for both parties. it is also a regional victory for the biden administration, which lately has seen diplomatic tensions rise with some of its middle east allies, especially those in the gulf. with the possibility of much needed gas from the mediterranean and averting a potential security crisis between historic enemies, the united states notched an important win in a region where its influence has seemingly diminished. while there are limitations to the deal, it is perceived as a step forward on more than one front. here are five ways the landmark maritime border deal between israel and lebanon matters: 1) a security crisis averted, for now under dispute for years, the 860-square-kilometer area of the mediterranean potentially harbors billions of dollars' worth of oil and gas. tensions worsened earlier this year when, in june, a london-based vessel arrived to develop a gas field for israel. although the rig itself is positioned south of the disputed area, the field it is exploring stretches across what was one of lebanon's southernmost claimed lines, prompting lebanon to warn israel against ""aggressive action"" in the disputed waters. hezbollah, the iran-backed lebanese militant group, later vowed an ""escalation"" if its rights were not met in the deal, and in july even sent drones toward the gas rig as a ""message"" to israel. rhetoric from some lebanese parliamentarians had even used the word ""war"" to describe a no-deal situation, and just days before the agreement, israel's defense minister instructed his troops to ""prepare for any scenario in which tensions increase in the northern arena -- including defense and offense readiness."" while both parties beat the battle drums, analysts are skeptical that the dispute would have erupted into full-blown war. ""i'm not sure hezbollah wanted to go to war,"" said lebanese energy expert laury haytayan. ""it was just trying to get a better deal."" israeli prime minister yair lapid said that the agreement strengthens israel's security, will boost its economy and ""ensure the stability of our northern border."" while the deal is a win for both sides, future security threats are not likely to be eliminated by the maritime agreement, said elai rettig, assistant professor in the department of political studies at bar-ilan university in tel aviv. 2) lebanon sees potential economic relief beyond the security hurdles that exploration and drilling companies faced in the area, the deal could mark the beginning of a key source of income for lebanon's crippled economy. with little to no government cohesion, lebanon is now in its fourth year of financial meltdown. the maritime border agreement reached tuesday will be a ""gamechanger"" for crisis-hit lebanon, top negotiator and lebanese deputy speaker elias bou saab told cnn's becky anderson on tuesday. ""people will start talking to lebanon again,"" bou saab said, adding that said the deal will give lebanon's youth ""hope"" and create more trust in the international community. under the us-brokered deal, lebanon would be able to begin gas exploration in the qanaa prospect -- which lays within lebanon's exploration block but crosses over into israeli waters. the qanaa gas field is yet to be explored, but lebanon believes it is rich with resources. under a consortium led by total, the french energy company, lebanon would be able to explore and drill in qanaa while paying royalties to israel should gas be found. while the agreement is a positive step for lebanon's economy, substantial economic relief is not expected to emerge overnight, said rettig. ""right now, it is all a potential,"" he told cnn. ""the more positive sense is that if lebanon can close this deal and show that it is open for business, and total comes in and starts looking, it can invigorate the market,"" said rettig, noting that it could bring in more investments amid promises of better stability and security. if total does indeed begin exploration for the lebanese, it could also offer incentives for other companies to apply to do the same, said haytayan, adding that with these prospects in mind, it is yet to be seen what the direct economic impacts will be. 3) israel can help ease europe's gas shortage europe's gas crisis is only deepening. governments are doing all they can to shield consumers from price shocks, but the crisis took a further dip after explosions damaged nord stream 1 and 2 last month. the nord stream 1 pipeline was europe's main source of russian gas. israel has said that, once a maritime deal is signed with lebanon, it can begin extracting oil and gas from its karish field and export it to europe within weeks. lapid has repeatedly spoken about the role israel can play to help europe as western countries try to wean themselves off russian energy. while israel's gas field is ready, lebanon's is lagging far behind. bou saab said that lebanon might see gas in three or four years once total begins its work in qana. ""for now, lebanon is not the market that europeans are looking for,"" said haytayan, noting that the levantine country needs years of infrastructure building to be able to find and exploit any gas. 4) a win for the biden administration us president joe biden and his administration have had a heated year with their middle east allies, particularly saudi arabia. relations hit a new low last week when the oil cartel opec+, led by saudi arabia and russia, defied the us with the largest output cut since the pandemic. the oil production slash only brought added pressure for biden. us mediation efforts were key to achieving the israel-lebanon maritime deal after previous administrations' failed attempts, and analysts say this bolsters the biden administration ahead of us midterm elections. 5) an eleventh-hour agreement with lebanon ahead of israeli elections israel is just three weeks away from elections, its fifth in less than four years. the november 1 vote may pave the way for the re-emergence of former prime minister benjamin netanyahu to take back power, unseating the current centrist caretaker prime minister lapid. lapid has hailed the agreement as ""historic"" and a win for israel on security and economic grounds. ""it is a deal with an enemy state,"" rettig told cnn, adding that it compels lebanon, which does not recognize the state of israel, to de facto recognize israel's existence on an official level and its maritime border. but netanyau and his allies are framing the deal as a ""surrender"" driven by hezbollah's threats, noted rettig, the tel aviv political scientist. so while lapid may hope the deal will be a political win for him, it could yet backfire if the opposition's view catches on with israeli voters. ""hezbollah will use billions from the gas to arm itself with missiles and rockets against israeli citizens, and iran will position itself in front of rosh hanikra (a kibbutz in northern israel) and in front of israel's gas reserves,"" netanyahu tweeted. iran protests multiple strikes by oil contract workers have been taking place across iran in different petrochemical complexes in support of the ongoing protests, according to a statement from the organizing council of oil contractor workers. on tuesday, workers protested at the abadan oil refining company in the southwestern city of abadan, according to a statement from the council. abadan oil refinery is one of the largest refineries in iran, according to the semiofficial news outlet irna. strikes also occurred on monday in hengam, damavand, and kangan petrochemical complexes, in the busher province, as well as the kavian petrochemical complex in tehran, the organizing council reported. eleven workers have been arrested so far, the council said in a separate statement. workers' strikes in iran, and specifically oil and gas workers' strikes, have historically led to collective labor action, a crucial factor in the removal of the shah of iran in the leadup to the 1979 islamic revolution. here is the latest on this developing story: former us president barack obama and former first lady michelle obama on tuesday said they stood in solidarity with iranian women amid the nationwide protests, according to a statement posted on the couple's twitter accounts. iranian interior minister ahmad vahidi on tuesday said the uprising in iran was being orchestrated by foreign-supported ""terrorist organizations"" hiding in northern iraq, reported irna. iran's foreign ministry on monday summoned the uk ambassador to iran simon shercliff for the third time in a month after the united kingdom announced sanctions against its morality police and top officials on monday, according to the iranian state-owned network press tv. the mother of nika shahkarami, a 16-year-old-protester who was found dead in tehran, denied that her daughter fell from a roof, according to interviews with iranian newspaper etemad, bbc persian and a video message published by us-funded radio farda. the digest uae president mbz visits putin in russia united arab emirates president sheikh mohamed bin zayed al-nahyan met with russian president vladimir putin in st. petersburg on tuesday. background: ""this was a prescheduled official trip which was supposed to focus mostly on bilateral issues but the recent escalation in the war in ukraine has given this trip added impetus,"" the uae's presidential adviser anwar gargash told cnn on tuesday. why it matters: this visit comes less than a week after opec+, the international cartel of oil producers, announced a significant cut to output in an effort to raise oil prices. the uae is a member of the organization led by saudi arabia and russia. an intense pressure campaign by the us to dissuade its arab allies from the cut ahead of the decision failed. biden says it is time to ""rethink"" saudi-us relations us president joe biden told cnn's jake tapper during an exclusive interview that he believed it was time to ""rethink"" the us relationship with saudi arabia after the kingdom partnered with russia to cut oil production, a rebuke after intensive white house efforts to prevent such a decision. background: ""there's going to be some consequences for what they've [saudi arabia] done with russia,"" ",2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.05469064484350383,0.40847435407340527,0.28683501156046987,0.3751122234029012,0,0,0,0,0.7502244468058024,-6.13623510167608,45.0,-0.13636078003724622
Opinion: Jared Kushner settles a few scores,2022-08-29,63.0,"in the trump white house, jared and ivanka kushner were famously referred to as ""the interns."" now, jared kushner has written a book about his internship, modestly titled ""breaking history,"" in which he casts himself as a diplomatic genius -- a latter-day metternich with a solid dose of henry kissinger thrown in. describing his time in government, he writes: ""humbled by the complexity of the task, i orchestrated some of the most significant breakthroughs in diplomacy in the last fifty years."" and that's just in the preface. the nearly 500 pages that follow are rife with this kind of self-congratulatory puffery. to be fair, kushner was arguably the most important person in the trump administration after his mercurial father-in-law. but that was less about his abilities and more because he was one of the very few people -- along with his wife and olympic-level sycophant vice president mike pence -- who had seemingly guaranteed job security in an administration known for its rapidly revolving door. at the trump white house, kushner was allowed to dabble in pretty much anything he wanted, while never officially taking responsibility for many of those roles -- an enviable position to be in when things didn't go well. he took over the portfolios of china, mexico, the middle east and nafta. when the coronavirus hit, he became one of the de facto covid-19 leaders as well. by kushner's own account, he performed brilliantly in all of these gigs, a fact that, in his view, would be more widely recognized if only other senior administration officials hadn't been so incapable of appreciating his inestimable talents. kushner recounts an episode in which trump's chief strategist, steve bannon, and trump's chief of staff, reince priebus, supposedly drafted a resignation letter for kushner to sign. kushner takes the opportunity to settle some scores with a number of those top officials, including bannon, former trump chief of staff john kelly, former secretary of state rex tillerson and dr. anthony fauci, the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases. kushner's real-world experience before entering the white house was running his family real estate company. in that role, he presided over what was arguably the worst real estate deal in manhattan's history: buying 666 fifth avenue for a record $1.8 billion in 2007, which became a financial albatross when the recession hit a short time later. kushner also purchased the new york observer, which he reportedly used to attempt to undermine his rivals and suppress unflattering stories about his cronies. the observer went entirely digital in 2016, and cnn reported at the time that its influence had ""diminished"" since kushner had taken it over. never mind those failures: when trump took the white house, kushner became the go-to guy on an ever-widening set of portfolios. on nafta, which trump called ""the worst trade deal ever,"" kushner inserted himself into the re-negotiations around the trade accord. but, in the end, the deal that he struck, which was rebranded as the united states mexico canada agreement (usmca),was a lot like the old nafta. the new deal included relatively minor changes, such as opening up the canadian market to us dairy farmers and requiring automobiles to have a higher percentage (75% instead of 62.5%) of their components manufactured in the three countries in order to qualify for zero tariffs. kushner presented the usmca as momentous (""i helped renegotiate the largest trade deal in history"") despite the fact that the changes between natfa and usmca were ""mostly cosmetic,"" according to a brookings institution analysis of the new deal. the abraham accords kushner can certainly count the ""abraham accords"" as an achievement, given that two small gulf monarchies, the united arab emirates (uae) and bahrain, signed deals recognizing the state of israel for the first time during the trump administration. kosovo, morocco and sudan all forged ties with israel as well. but the abraham accords hardly compare with the 1978 camp david accords that then-president jimmy carter brokered between egypt and israel, two countries that had been at war for decades. the uae and bahrain, meanwhile, had never fought a war with israel, and the fact that they normalized relations with the jewish state was more about creating a coalition against their common enemy iran than kushner's brilliant negotiations. yet, kushner recounts his role with blustering bravado: ""getting this deal done was like trying to land a plane on an aircraft carrier in the middle of a storm."" alrighty. a key part of kushner's plan to bring peace to the palestinian territories was to secure $50 billion of investment for palestinian projects. but both the palestinians and the israelis boycotted the much-ballyhooed palestinian investment conference that kushner hosted in bahrain in june 2019. and there doesn't seem to be evidence that kushner's investment plans ever came to fruition. kushner also seems to have forgotten the original purpose of why he took up the ""peace process."" it was purportedly to bring about a two-state solution between israel and the palestinians. kushner seemed to be operating on the theory that normalizing relations between israel and the arab states would cause the arab countries to push the palestinians to agree to a two-state solution. providing significant arab investment in the palestinian territories would also help sweeten the deal. but none of that worked and by the end of the trump administration, the two-state solution seemed more a mirage than ever. meanwhile, the trump administration gave then israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu -- an old family friend of the kushners -- pretty much everything he wanted: pulling out of the iranian nuclear deal, reversing american policy and declaring that it did not consider israeli settlements in the west bank a violation of international law and withdrawing us support for the united nations relief and works agency (unrwa), which among other things, educated hundreds of thousands of displaced palestinian kids living as refugees in countries around the middle east. the crown prince trump's first overseas visit was to saudi arabia, a trip that kushner had pushed hard for. shortly after the trip, the saudis imposed a blockade on qatar, which had long found their enormously wealthy neighbor to be an irritant. the saudis knew that with president barack obama in the white house, a blockade of qatar likely wouldn't fly, but the trump-kushner team was another matter. it's unclear whether trump and kushner were either unaware or simply didn't care that qatar sits on some of the largest natural gas reserves in the world and is also home to the largest us military base in the middle east. the two trump cabinet officials who knew the most about qatar, tillerson, who was previously the chairman and ceo of exxon, and then-secretary of defense james mattis, who had commanded centcom, were both angered by the blockade. but kushner sidelined them both on the qatar issue. saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman, known as mbs, knew that the one person who really counted in all this was kushner, who had his back. the absolute gulf monarchies who run their fiefdoms as family businesses had a shrewd understanding of where the power really resided in the trump administration. kushner's relationship with mbs, who the cia concluded ordered the murder of washington post columnist jamal khashoggi, has certainly proven lucrative. against the advice of its own board of advisers, a saudi sovereign wealth fund led by mbs reportedly invested $2 billion in kushner's newly formed private equity firm just six months after trump left office. this extraordinarily cushy deal goes unmentioned in kushner's very long book. prison reform in fairness to kushner, he certainly did get some things right. one of most important events in his adult life was, inarguably, the imprisonment of his father charles kushner, who was convicted of witness tampering and several other charges after he hired a prostitute to seduce his brother-in-law in a new jersey hotel room while a hidden camera rolled. as part of the revenge plot, he then sent the tape to his own sister, who along with her husband, had been cooperating with the feds in an investigation into charles kushner's campaign contributions. he was sentenced to two years, and his son movingly describes visiting his father every weekend at the alabama prison where he was incarcerated. given this personal experience, kushner campaigned for prison reform during his time in the trump white house and helped create a coalition with sen. dick durbin of illinois and cnn commentator van jones, among others, to move this bipartisan measure through congress. the resulting reforms helped address some of the disparities in sentencing between crack cocaine convictions and powder cocaine offenses that tended to penalize black offenders it also lowered mandatory minimum sentences for non-violent crimes and gave judges the leeway to dole out more lenient sentences to those who deserved them. covid-19 kushner also deserves credit for helping orchestrate the trump administration's vaccination program, known as ""operation warp speed,"" during the pandemic. the government invested $1 billion in moderna, which produced a testable vaccine in just a matter of months and placed another $1.5 billion order for 100 million doses of the vaccine. and while pfizer didn't directly take us government money in the research phase, the administration did strike an advance-purchase deal with the company to obtain more than 100 million doses for $1.95 billion. yet, kushner never grapples with his father-in-law's role as a one-man super-spreader of lies and disinformation. this surely contributed to many unnecessary deaths during the pandemic, given trump's influence on his supporters and the key role that the president's bully pulpit plays in american life. early on, trump repeatedly downplayed the severity of the pandemic, saying the virus would ""go away"" or ""disappear."" trump also denigrated mask-wearing and almost invariably refused to wear a mask himself at a time when vaccines were not yet available and masks were one of the most effective ways to curb the spread of the virus. dr. deborah birx, trump's coronavirus response coordinator, told a house select subcommittee that that the trump administration's botched response to covid-19 proved lethal for many tens of thousands of americans. if the administration had followed the science and implemented more mitigation measures, she testified, ""we probably could have decreased fatalities into the 30-percent-less to 40-percent-less range."" kushner also gives his father-in-law a free pass on spreading falsehoods about the 2020 election being stolen from him. at one point, kushner writes

Why Hamas stayed out of the latest Gaza conflict,2022-08-08,64.0,"one of the most important aspects of the weekend's short but violent conflict between israel and the palestinian islamic jihad (pij) was what didn't happen: hamas' involvement. a ceasefire between israel and the pij over gaza that went into effect at 11:30 p.m. local time (4:30 p.m. et) sunday appeared to be holding almost 24 hours later. the conflict led to the death of at least 44 militants and civilians in gaza, according to information from the palestinian ministry of health. fifteen of the dead were children. israel insists most of those killed were militants, and that several civilians were killed by failed militant rocket launches. hamas, the militant group that runs gaza, expressed support for the pij's actions. but it kept its much larger and more powerful arsenal of rockets out of the equation, while israel's military made it clear from the outset they were focusing solely on pij targets. that kept the conflict from spiraling into a larger, more dangerous confrontation, and closer to what happened during the 11-day war in may 2021. so why not get involved? according to analysts and israeli officials, one reason is the fact it is still only 15 months since the 2021 conflict that led to considerable damage and death in gaza. palestinians there are still rebuilding their homes, and hamas is rebuilding its arsenal. the israeli government also believes its campaign of economic incentives -- boosting the number of permits given to gazans to cross into israel for work -- is succeeding. israel and egypt have imposed a closure on gaza since 2007, limiting access to the territory via land, air and sea, including tight restrictions on the movement of residents and the flow of goods. if rockets are fired, israel closes the border and the thousands of gazans with permits can't work in israel or get paid. on monday, a senior israeli diplomatic official said hamas was ""an enemy not a partner ... but there is cooperation we can do, predominantly through egypt, to improve the situation in gaza."" for showing restraint, hamas will expect to be rewarded. lapid's first big security test the weekend's conflict was also the first major military test for interim prime minister yair lapid. unlike his predecessor naftali bennett, lapid is not known for his military combat experience. but like us president joe biden's visit last month, it was another moment for lapid to look like a real prime minister — images lapid likely hopes israelis remember as they had to the polls in november. the conflict also brought about another breakthrough, albeit on a somewhat smaller scale: former prime minister, now opposition leader benjamin netanyahu met with lapid on sunday to receive a security briefing on the operation. it was his first security briefing since leaving power -- even though by law it is supposed to be standard practice. until this weekend, netanyahu had boycotted the meetings. after the meeting, netanyahu said he supported the operation and gave his ""full backing to the government, the idf, and the security forces."" parts of gaza once again lie in rubble and the mourning continues for lost lives, but for everyday israelis and gazans, the conflict hasn't led to a substantial change in the political situation on the ground. the digest russia envoy to iran nuclear talks says they are ""moving in right direction"" ambassador mikhail ulyanov, russia's chief negotiator in vienna for talks aimed at reviving the iran nuclear deal, on sunday told media, ""i cannot guarantee [anything], but the impression is that we are moving in the right direction."" he said there were ""minimal"" unresolved issues, ""just 3 [or] 4."" background: tehran ramped up uranium enrichment at a pace not seen since the signing of the 2015 nuclear deal. former us president donald trump withdrew from that agreement in 2018. in june, iran switched off surveillance cameras used by the international atomic energy agency to monitor activity at the country's key nuclear facilities. sunday marked the fourth day of this latest round -- the nineth -- of the iran nuclear talks. why it matters: talks broke down earlier this year over tehran's insistence that the us remove the revolutionary guards from its list of terrorist organizations, which the us has refused to do. the us did however send special envoy for iran rob malley to vienna for the new round of talks, and us secretary of state antony blinken last monday said that the us is ""prepared to move forward on the basis of what's been agreed,"" but it is unclear if iran is prepared to do the same. putin, erdogan agree to begin partial payment in rubles for russian gas bilateral talks in sochi between russian president vladimir putin and turkish president recep tayyip erdogan included an agreement to pay russia in rubles for partial gas supplies. russian deputy prime minister alexander novak said the two presidents reached agreements on establishing a financial banking bloc ""to enable commercial companies, russian citizens, to pay during tourist trips and exchange money."" background: russia has been trying to force its customers to pay for energy in rubles. president vladimir putin signed a decree in march that requires buyers of natural gas from ""unfriendly countries"" to hold accounts at gazprombank — russia's third-largest bank — and settle contracts in rubles. why it matters: russia is on a mission to prove it's not as isolated as the us would like it to be. tightening relations between putin and erdogan may provide russia with routes to ease the pressure of western sanctions on the country. the ruble crashed to a record low in the wake of the invasion, but it is the world's best-performing currency this year, according to reuters. the central bank has implemented policies to prevent investors and companies from selling the currency and other measures that force them to buy it. iran city reaches 53 degrees celsius, hottest temperature in the world this year abadan, iran had a high temperature of 53.0° c (127.4° f) friday -- the highest temperature recorded anywhere in the world in 2022, according to weather historian maximiliano herrera. background: numerous locations across iran, iraq and kuwait topped 50 degrees celsius friday. temperatures were expected to drop back closer to average after the weekend, with highs in the mid to upper 40s celsius. the highest temperature ever recorded in the world is 56.7° c (134.1° f) in death valley, california, on july 10, 1913. why it matters: heat of this caliber raises major concerns for heat-related illness, especially for those without access to water and proper shelter and is likely to bolster arguments for action on climate change. what's trending kuwait: #wage_rise_is_a_public_demand the citizens of one of the richest arab countries are demanding a rise in wages. kuwaitis took to twitter to express their frustration at the country's economic situation, blaming official corruption and greed for alleged inequality in pay. kuwaiti citizens are a minority in the country of 4.2 million, making up just 30% of the population, according to world population review. most rely on government jobs to make a living. ""it's inconceivable that a rich country like kuwait that has a small number of people and the strongest currency in the world [wouldn't raise wages],"" tweeted mohammed al huwaishel. ""the demands of the people must be met without conditions."" many kuwaitis take government jobs -- where pay can be up to 28% higher than the private sector -- because they either lack the necessary skills to work in the private sector or because some of those jobs are seen as menial, according to the middle east institute. due to the benefits offered in government jobs, the private sector finds it difficult to lure kuwaitis. according to the international monetary fund, public wages and benefits account for one-third of the government's budget. the government set aside $72 billion in spending for its latest budget. the world bank warned in december that the government's wage bill is unsustainable, saying that if the situation continues, the country's financial reserves will be depleted. the nation has made the least progress among oil-rich gulf arab countries to reform its wage bill and has even increased hiring, it said. another hashtag on twitter called on the government to write off citizens' debt, which is not without precedent. after the end of the 1991 gulf war, the government wrote off almost all consumer debt. by mohammed abdelbary photo of the day",3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.22789259241044257,0.36747547748841736,0.32568457140178797,0.15057777956975324,0,0,0,0,0.4517333387092597,1.632924466532412,13.0,0.12560957434864709
Israel's Prime Minister makes rare allusion to country's nuclear weapons arsenal,2022-08-02,65.0,"israel's prime minister yair lapid made a rare allusion to the country's widely suspected nuclear arsenal during a speech on monday. speaking at an event to mark a change of leadership at the country's atomic energy commission, lapid referred to israel's defensive and offensive capabilities, as well as what he called its ""other capabilities"" -- understood to be a reference to nuclear weapons. ""the operational arena in the invisible dome above us is built on defensive capabilities and offensive capabilities, and what the foreign media tends to call 'other capabilities.' these other capabilities keep us alive and will keep us alive so long as we and our children are here,"" lapid said. israel is widely believed to possess a few hundred nuclear weapons, developing the technology in the 1960s. unlike most assumed nuclear weapons states, israel has never formally declared possession. instead it pursues a policy of 'opacity' -- meaning israeli leaders, when pushed, have preferred to make only oblique or ambiguous reference to nukes. the first such statement was made in the early 1960s by then junior defense minister shimon peres who said that israel would ""certainly not be the first to introduce nuclear weapons into the region."" more recently, former prime minister ehud olmert appeared to acknowledge the nuclear capability when he listed israel, along with the united states, russia and france, as having nuclear weapons, though he later attempted to row back the comments, which were made on german television. benjamin netanyahu too once referred to israel as a ""nuclear power"" during a presentation to his cabinet, before he corrected himself to say ""energy power.""

Why Joe Biden's fist bump with MBS was such a disaster,2022-07-17,66.0,"in the weeks leading up to president joe biden's trip to the middle east, one question dominated: would he meet with saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman? and, if he did, what would his demeanor be? after all, mbs had been linked by the us intelligence community directly to the murder of washington post journalist jamal khashoggi in istanbul in 2018. the report, which the biden administration released in february 2021, concluded that mbs had ""approved"" the operation that led to khashogggi's death. and, as a candidate, biden had struck a hard line with the saudis. in one of the 2020 presidential debates, he was unequivocal in his denunciation of the saudis for their role in khashoggi's death. ""we [are] going to, in fact, make them pay the price, and make them, in fact, the pariah that they are,"" biden pledged. given all that, there was reason to wonder how biden would play all of this. on thursday, the white house confirmed, as expected, that biden would in fact meet with mbs -- and would bring up the killing of khashoggi. ""my views on khashoggi have been made absolutely, positively clear, and i have never been quiet about asking about human rights,"" biden said. in defending himself against the seeming contradiction of calling the country a ""pariah"" less than two years ago and then granting saudi leaders exactly what they wanted -- an audience with the american president -- biden explained: ""there are so many issues at stake that i want to make clear that we can continue to lead in the region and not create a vacuum -- a vacuum that is filled by china and or russia, against the interest of both israel and the united states and many other countries."" which, well, ok? what biden didn't mention was the elephant in the room: saudi arabia has oil -- lots and lots of it -- that the united states needs. that's always been true, but it is even more true with biden pledging not to import any oil from russia due to its invasion of ukraine. (gas prices have come down somewhat from their highs of a month ago but remain elevated.) but, all of that pales in comparison to how biden ultimately handled the meet-and-greet with mbs. the two men fist-bumped, a bro-ey move of perceived friendship and camaraderie that gave the saudi leader exactly what he wanted: a door to return back into international good graces. as the bbc noted: ""the saudis knew the world would be watching this meeting. ""they wanted the rest of the middle east, and the international community, to sit up and take notice of the favour they had been granted by the us president."" need evidence that the saudis were thrilled with fist bump? they quickly moved to share the image around social media to ensure that everyone saw it. fred ryan, the publisher of the washington post, was heavily critical of the decision by the biden team -- calling the fist bump ""shameful."" he added: ""it projected a level of intimacy and comfort that delivers to mbs the unwarranted redemption he has been desperately seeking."" california democratic rep. adam schiff was similarly critical. ""if we ever needed a visual reminder of the continuing grip oil-rich autocrats have on u.s. foreign policy in the middle east, we got it today,"" he tweeted. ""one fist bump is worth a thousand words."" what's so remarkable -- and remarkably bad -- about the fist bump is that, as i mentioned above, the biden team has had oodles of time to prepare for this meeting with mbs. like, it was not a surprise that biden and mbs were going to meet -- and that the saudis would seek to leverage the meeting in every way possible. my guess is that the white house will note that biden did a lot of fist-bumping -- as opposed to handshakes -- during his visit as a way to keep his risk of contracting covid-19 lower. which, well, ok. it's worth noting that a) biden shook hands with former israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and b) there is plenty of hand sanitizer to be had if biden did shake hands with mbs. symbolism matters -- deeply -- in foreign affairs. biden, from his many years in the senate and his time as vice president, knows this. which makes the fist bump decision all the more confounding.",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.13676778227090836,0.5064281523227692,0.10680409893393517,-0.08833810991033672,0,0,0,0,-0.08833810991033672,-0.510295944443668,8.0,-0.0637869930554585
Opinion: Biden's risky fist bump with MBS,2022-07-17,67.0,"are presidential fist bumps a sign of distance or closeness? the biden administration may have thought that by avoiding a handshake with saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman, known as mbs, the president could dampen any criticism for meeting the de facto ruler of a nation he once vowed to shun. (the white house had said the fist bumps were an effort to reduce physical contact on his trip to the middle east, although biden broke out the handshakes for former israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and clasped hands with a pair of holocaust survivors earlier in his trip.) the administration was wrong on that count, but it was right in anticipating the level of attention the greeting would draw. after all, the world was gripped by then-president donald trump's unusually long handshakes with a bewildered japanese prime minister and a competitive french president. handshakes -- or their stand-ins -- can be weighty diplomatic theater. but joe biden's saudi trip has been much more than theater. it has been a high stakes gambit filled with urgent, concrete objectives, and biden had greater aims than simply lowering gas prices for americans in order to boost his own political standing, as so many suggest. this meeting was more about kyiv than kenosha; more about tehran than toledo. the controversy over meeting mbs had already exploded before biden landed in jeddah for a trip that was timed to coincide with a regional summit of nine arab countries in an effort to strengthen us leadership in the region. but it was the meeting with mbs that produced the most caustic criticism. the brash 36-year-old's ruthlessness was never a secret, but the depth of his cruelty shocked even the most jaded realists in 2018 when his agents lured, murdered and dismembered the journalist jamal khashoggi, a critic of the regime. us intelligence concluded that mbs had ordered the assassination. he denies it. (disclosure: khashoggi was a contributing columnist at the washington post, as am i.) as a presidential candidate aiming to challenge trump, who had unquestioningly embraced many of the world's most brutal dictators, including mbs, biden vowed to treat the saudis like pariahs. initially, biden kept his word. he would communicate solely with saudi king salman bin abdulaziz al-saud, according to the white house, denying mbs the recognition as de facto ruler. biden also declassified the cia report implicating mbs in khashoggi's murder. but then the world changed. russia invaded ukraine, initiating what has become a devastating war of attrition. russia has been accused of massacring civilians, including countless children; it has also created millions of refugees, destroyed infrastructure and captured ukrainian territories. soaring food prices threaten to cause mass starvation. oil prices, too, skyrocketed, with grave consequences. biden mobilized the western alliance to support ukraine as more european countries, including finland and sweden, asked to join north atlantic treaty organization for fear that russia would one day target them. vladimir putin's threats went so far as to suggest that countries that once belonged to the ussr -- three of which are now nato members -- should still be ruled by moscow. russia's aggression, in other words, extends far beyond ukraine. it could not be allowed to be succeed. enter saudi arabia. washington's relationship with saudi arabia has always been a morally disturbing one. it requires a distasteful weighing of principles against interests. since president franklin delano roosevelt met with king ibn saud in 1945, striking a deal to provide arms and security in exchange for a reliable supply of oil, every us president has maintained relations with their saudi counterparts, often traveling to the kingdom to establish stronger ties. barack obama, incidentally, holds the record, going four times during his presidency. fdr, remember, met with joseph stalin, a mass murdering soviet leader, during world war ii because he thought they could join forces to defeat hitler, the greatest threat. to defeat the nazis, roosevelt reportedly said, he ""would hold hands with the devil."" mbs is not the devil and putin is not hitler. the point is that sometimes leaders need to hold their noses and come together with figures they'd much rather shun. what's key here is that saudi arabia plays a crucial role in bolstering the west's support for ukraine. regionally, the kingdom is an important force in trying to contain the iranian regime. and, longer term, maintaining ties with mbs is about keeping the global balance of power on the side of the us, rather than china. when it comes to oil, the us doesn't need saudi arabia to keep its economy afloat. the us has become the world's top oil producer. but saudi holds one of the largest reserves, and the ability to increase the supply of oil and gas would lower prices worldwide, which could indirectly determine the outcome of the war in ukraine. to defeat putin, ukraine needs sustained western support. if oil prices remain high and the global economy plunges into recession, popular approval for helping ukraine may not last. europeans struggling to pay heating bills this winter may start to question the wisdom of squeezing russia's vast oil and gas exports, and their discontent could cause their leaders to fold. if biden had gone to saudi arabia on bended knee in order to buoy his approval ratings and scrape a few cents off prices at the pump in the us, the trip would have been a less forgivable sacrifice of principles. but this was a larger geopolitical gambit against an aggressive russian dictator who is accused of ordering the slaughter of civilians. it doesn't make the killing of khashoggi any less appalling, the execution and imprisonment of saudi critics on what many consider trumped-up charges any less deplorable, or the ""guardianship"" system of saudi women any less infuriating. but engaging with saudi arabia allows the us to bolster its influence on major global conflicts -- with the potential to influence the saudis, too. for one, the us is building a regional bloc, including israel and several arab countries, to counter tehran, which may soon possess nuclear weapons. and the reality is that mbs is likely to rule the kingdom for decades and the crown prince knows there are alternatives to the us. as mbs noted in a march interview with the atlantic, if the us pulls away, ""i believe other people in the east are going to be super happy."" the crown prince has been bolstering relations with chinese leader xi jinping in recent years, and reportedly invited him to the kingdom in march, though that visit has not yet occurred. the west understands the risk. ""we are not going to leave a vacuum in the middle east for russia or china to fill,"" biden declared on friday. china won't publicly chastise the saudis for murdering a journalist, as biden did. they won't discuss ""human rights and the need for political reform,"" as biden, on saudi soil, told the entire world he had done. will the criticism work? will the trip pay off? we still don't know. we do know that biden's visit to saudi arabia was a victory for mbs, as it granted him the recognition he craves. that's why the palace rushed to broadcast the pictures of biden fist bumping the prince -- never mind that biden likely meant it as a sign of chilliness. if the saudis raise oil and natural gas output, helping ease the price of fuel as the west prepares for winter without russian gas supplies; if they loosen more restrictions on women; if they allow now-restricted american citizens to leave the country, then we will know it was worth it. it was a gamble. let's hope it pays off.",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.055821107418248146,0.4353619696515979,0.1300290348854932,0.2039331345964858,0,0,0,0,0.2039331345964858,-1.0565872566529844,7.0,-0.15094103666471206
Biden tries to ease worries over US commitment to the Middle East in meetings with key leaders,2022-07-16,68.0,"president joe biden on saturday attempted to reassert us leadership in the middle east as he met with key leaders in the region, promising his administration would stay engaged amid fears china and russia would swiftly fill a leadership vacuum. the president said american leadership in the middle east would focus on using diplomacy to strengthen alliances and build coalitions, and that the us' objectives would remain ""focused, realistic and achievable."" his speech comes nearly one year after the us withdrew all military troops from afghanistan and ended 20 years of war in the country. he noted his visit to the middle east was the first time since the september 11 terrorist attacks in 2001 that a us president visited the region without american troops being engaged in combat in the region, though us forces continue to conduct operations in syria. biden's foreign policy since taking office has largely focused on countering china's growing geopolitical influence and russia's war in ukraine, which has raised questions about the extent of the president's commitment to engagement in the middle east. but on saturday at a summit in jeddah, the president sought to assure other middle eastern leaders -- and the rest of the world -- that the us still sees the region as crucial to its foreign policy goals. ""let me state clearly that the united states is going to remain an active and engaged partner in the middle east,"" biden said at a summit attended by key leaders on the last day of his middle east swing. the president said, ""as the world grows more competitive, and the challenges we face more complex, it is only becoming clearer to me how closely interwoven our interests are with the successes of the middle east. we will not walk away and leave a vacuum to be filled by china, russia, or iran."" the president announced $1 billion in aid to food security assistance in the middle east and north africa on saturday. the president also announced gulf arab leaders are pledging more than $3 billion over the next two years in projects that align with global infrastructure and investment. the president said the us would focus on supporting countries ""that subscribe to a rules-basedinternational order,"" including helping those countries defend themselves against foreign threats. he thanked the leaders present for voting to condemn russia's invasion of ukraine at the un general assembly and called it a ""watershed moment"" that showed ""the core values"" of the region. he spoke of the importance of protecting the ""freedom of navigation"" through waterways in the middle east, which allows for the free flow of commerce and resources throughout the region. biden said the us has established a new naval task force to work in partnership with middle eastern countries to help secure the red sea. biden said the us would ""work to reduce tensions, deescalate and end conflicts wherever possible."" he pointed to the truce in yemen -- its first nationwide truce in six years -- as an example of successful diplomacy. he again vowed to never let iran acquire a nuclear weapon. the president also touched on human rights as he sat beside saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman, calling the values enshrined in the un charter ""foundational to who we are as americans."" ""i've gotten plenty of criticism over the years. it's not fun. but the ability to speak openly, exchange ideas freely, is what unlocks innovation,"" biden said. biden held several bilateral meetings with leaders from iraq, egypt and the united arab emirates, and participated in a gcc+ 3 summit on saturday. the gcc+ 3 is made up of the gulf cooperation council (gcc) -- an alliance of saudi arabia, kuwait, the united arab emirates, qatar, bahrain and oman -- plus egypt, iraq and jordan. he departed saudi arabia for washington after wrapping up his meetings. large parts of the region have been embroiled in economic turmoil in recent years exacerbated by the pandemic. russia's invasion of ukraine and moscow's stifling of ukraine's vast wheat exports have also pushed much of the middle east and north africa to the brink of wide-scale food insecurity. biden came to jeddah seeking solutions to one of his top political problems at home -- sky-high gas prices -- as diplomacy with saudi arabia in the middle east was seen as one of the few routes he could take to bring down prices that are putting strain on millions of americans. but white house officials say the president won't be returning to washington on saturday with explicit oil production increases. the expectation is that there will be increases in the months ahead -- done within the context of increased output levels in the opec+ cartel laid out at its august meeting. in his remarks to the summit, bin salman said joint international efforts were needed for the recovery of the global economy and that ""unrealistic policies"" on energy would lead to ""unprecedented inflation."" ""adopting unrealistic policies to reduce emissions through the exclusion of the main sources of energy, without taking into consideration the impact of these policies on the social and economic pillars of sustainable development and global supply chains, will lead in the coming years to unprecedented inflation, increased fuel prices, increased unemployment and exasperation of dangerous social and security problems including poverty, famine, escalation of crime, extremism and terrorism,"" the crown prince said. biden's visit to saudi arabia has been closely watched. the president announced several new areas of cooperation aimed at reshaping us-saudi relations on friday, but it has been his interactions with the saudi crown prince that have drawn the most attention. the us declassified an intelligence report last year that concluded bin salman approved the killing of saudi journalist and washington post columnist jamal khashoggi. despite once vowing to make saudi arabia a ""pariah"" on the world stage, biden fist bumped the crown prince upon greeting him in jeddah ahead of their meetings. fellow democrats and others decried the gesture as too friendly and said it sent the wrong message. biden later told reporters he raised khashoggi's killing directly with bin salman and said he believed the crown prince was responsible. he was met with saudi pushback, according to a source familiar with the matter. the crown prince, the de facto ruler of the kingdom, told biden any attempt to impose values on another country was viewed as counterproductive to the relationship. he then noted that there have been incidents, including the abuse of prisoners by us military personnel at abu ghraib prison in iraq, that reflect poorly on the us. the recent killing of al jazeera shireen abu akleh in the west bank and the us response, which has drawn criticism from abu akleh's family, was also brought up by the saudi side, the source said. senior administration officials on saturday defended the trip as an opportunity to raise concerns about the kingdom's rights record with the saudi crown prince. it would have been ""backsliding if the president didn't come to the region and it would be backsliding if he didn't and wasn't willing to sit and raise human rights concerns with foreign leaders around the world,"" an official said. responding to a question on saturday about the possibility of a widely anticipated saudi-israeli normalization agreement, an official said ""it's going to take some time."" the biden administration has for months sought to formalize security and economic deals between saudi arabia and israel, in a bid to set the stage for a normalization deal between the two countries. riyadh is believed to have a covert relationship with israel but has yet to officially disclose those diplomatic ties. in 2020, then-israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu reportedly flew to saudi arabia for a covert meeting with the kingdom's de facto leader, crown prince mohammed bin salman -- a claim that was denied by riyadh's top diplomat. a possible normalization between israel and saudi arabia has been hailed as the ""crown jewel"" of agreements between the jewish state and the arab world. the united arab emirates, bahrain, morocco and sudan normalized relations with israel in 2020 as part of a wave of agreements at the end of former president donald trump's term.

A 'Middle East NATO'? Why Iran is closely watching Biden's regional trip,2022-07-15,70.0,"united states president joe biden is on a landmark trip to the middle east. one country he won't be visiting, however, is dominating the agenda: iran. biden's itinerary includes just two countries, israel and saudi arabia. those are tehran's biggest regional foes, and they are coming closer together than ever before. the visit comes just weeks after israel said that it was working with regional partners on an air defense alliance that is led by the us. israel's defense minister benny gantz told the knesset, israel's parliament, that he hopes the program will ""take another step forward"" during biden's trip to the region. saudi arabia has been pressuring the us for security guarantees that would contain iran should nuclear talks fail. the last round of talks in doha two weeks ago resulted in a standstill, with the us saying iran added unrelated demands to the table. early on friday, just hours before biden was due to touch down in the kingdom, saudi arabia moved one step closer to normalizing relations with iran's arch-enemy israel by opening its airspace to all airlines. israeli carriers were previously barred from entering saudi airspace on most flights. last month, us lawmakers introduced legislation to create an integrated air defense system to increase cooperation between israel and its arab neighbors, including the countries whose leaders biden will meet in saudi arabia this week. the defense system is aimed to protect those states from iran. jordan's king abdullah, who biden will meet in saudi arabia, said this month he favors joining a ""middle east nato"" with like-minded countries, without specifying which. iran sees an arab-israeli military plan as a provocative move and a threat against its national security, foreign ministry spokesperson nasser kanani was cited saying on saturday by state news agency irna. he accused the us of spreading ""iranophobia"" among regional countries, according to irna. the united arab emirates, which has been engaging in direct talks with tehran , said on friday that it has no interest in joining an anti-iran alliance. ""we are open to cooperation, but not cooperation targeted at any other country in the region, and i specifically mention iran,"" anwar gargash, adviser to the uae president, told cnn's becky anderson. the uae is in the process of sending an ambassador to tehran, he added. some analysts say that if iran finds itself being ganged up on by its neighbors, it may retaliate. an arab-israeli military alliance is ""a terrible idea,"" said trita parsi, vice-president of the quincy institute in washington, dc, ""because it cements existing divisions in the region and reduces the likelihood of diplomatic breakthroughs."" such groupings are aimed at organizing the region against a certain state instead of achieving ""true peace,"" parsi told cnn. previous american attempts at isolating iran at the behest of israel led tehran to sabotage the palestinian-israeli peace process to undermine washington's efforts, he said. ""if biden's anti-iran alliance truly takes hold, it may prompt iran to go back to its policies of the 1990s when it actively pushed its allies to destabilize parts of the region,"" he added. on thursday, biden and israeli prime minister yair lapid signed a new joint declaration that included a commitment to never allow iran to acquire a nuclear weapon and to address iran's ""destabilizing activities."" ""there is potential that [biden's] visit could create further tensions,"" mohammad marandi, a professor at the university of tehran, told cnn. that prospect hasn't escaped gulf arab states, who are wary about getting caught in the line of fire between iran and the us. gargash told cnn that there is a need to de-escalate with iran. ""we have to find solutions, and we have also to use economic cooperation in various areas,"" he said. abdulkhaleq abdulla, a political science professor in the uae, told cnn that framing a potential military alliance as regional nato is ""very provocative, and i don't think it is acceptable to whoever is asked to join."" while there is regional consensus that iran is now more destabilizing than ever, israel and the gulf arab states differ on how to approach the problem, he told cnn. ""the mood in abu dhabi and in riyadh is to talk to iran rather than provoke iran,"" he said. ""this is where the gulf, especially saudi arabia and the uae, differ with israel."" the claim by the us this week that iran may be providing drones to russia may be used by the biden administration to strengthen the case for a middle east defense pact against iran, said aniseh bassiri, senior research fellow at the london-based royal united services institute (rusi). ""the timing of this information [on iranian drone sales] is interesting,"" she told cnn's becky anderson on tuesday. ""we know that the us, together with israel, is trying to shape this defense pact, and i think a lot of the focus of this pact is the capability that the countries have when it comes to drones. whether there is interest in the gcc (gulf cooperation council) countries is another question,"" she said. ""there is plenty of israeli propaganda that goes into marketing and promoting such a deal,"" said abdulla. ""logistically, it is not very easy to do."" the digest majority of saudi youth see palestinian cause as a priority, survey finds three-quarters of saudi youth believe addressing the palestinian-israeli conflict should be a priority for the arab world, according to the 13th edition of the arab youth survey. the survey also found that over 90% of saudi youth, who form nearly two-thirds of the country's population, see the us as an ally. background: the findings were announced on thursday ahead of biden's trip to saudi arabia. the survey comes amid strained us-saudi ties and an effort by the biden administration to strengthen relations between israel and saudi arabia. why it matters: the survey shows the importance saudi youth attach to the palestinian issue as riyadh moves closer to israel. it also suggests that despite the tensions between the biden administration and saudi arabia, saudi youths continue to see the us as an ally. netanyahu says biden agrees a military strike will be necessary if iran develops nuclear weapons israel's former prime minister benjamin netanyahu on thursday suggested that president biden agrees that a military strike on iran will be needed if tehran develops nuclear weapons. ""i told him that without a credible military option, iran cannot be stopped, and if iran is not deterred, this military option will need to be carried out. this is my position. i really hope it is also the american position,"" said netanyahu. ""he [biden] said he agrees with these words, and i was glad to hear it,"" he added. background: netanyahu's claim comes as he tries to make a comeback as prime minister amid a political deadlock in israel. during his trip to jerusalem, biden renewed his pledge to defend israel against iran. in an interview with israel's channel 12 news on wednesday, the president was asked if his commitment to ensure iran never acquired nuclear weapons meant he would use force against iran. ""if that was the last resort, yes,"" biden answered. why it matters: israel has been touting a ""regional air defense alliance"" led by the us, and which would predominantly be aimed at thwarting iranian drones and missiles. biden has defended his trip to middle east, saying regional allies are needed as iran makes progress in its nuclear program. white house confirms biden will meet with mbs without the saudi king present the white house on friday confirmed for the first time that biden will meet with saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman -- known as mbs -- without his father king salman present while the us president is in jeddah. background: according to biden's schedule, the saudi king will only be present for about 30 minutes during the bilateral meetings friday night. this is the first time the white house has acknowledged it publicly. biden and the crown prince will continue their meeting after the king departs. why it matters: the meeting would be a turnabout from biden's earlier attempt to shun mbs. the white house said early in biden's presidency that the president's interactions with the saudi leadership would be ""counterpart-to-counterpart."" what to watch lina au akleh, the niece of slain palestinian-american journalist shireen abu akleh, told cnn's becky anderson how her family feels about biden's regional tour as it continues to grieve. ""this is where shireen was born ... and she was killed here,"" abu akleh said. ""so it was very important for us to be able to sit with the president himself, to hear our demands."" watch the interview here: around the region some iranian women are defying their country's state-enforced veil, saying they want to let their hair down and dress freely. social media platforms have this week seen a barrage of posts showing iranian women inside and outside the country taking off their head coverings in public in defiance of the islamic republic's strict laws on morality. beginning with an activist campaign against iran's ""national day of hijab and chastity,"" which is observed by the persian gulf state every july 12 to promote the veil, the call to do away with the head covering has spread across social media. more than 120 rights activists signed a statement denouncing chastity day, saying that the commemoration is an excuse to ""mark the oppression of iranian women,"" reported the iranwire news site. women in iran are obliged to cover their hair with a veil, as well as wear loose-fitting garments to hide their body shapes. iran's semi-official fars news agency on wednesday published photos of women gathering on the streets of tehran, celebrating chastity day in full compliance with the rules. by nadeen ebrahim photo of the day",3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.04603255544614239,0.6143107123218232,0.17768489487224343,0.35560783093172416,0,0,0,0,1.0668234927951725,-0.42202258266226167,7.0,-0.0602889403803231
"Biden says diplomacy is still the best way to keep Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, despite Israeli skepticism",2022-07-14,71.0,"president joe biden on thursday said the us will not allow iran to acquire a nuclear weapon and that he believed diplomacy remained the best avenue to keep the nation from obtaining one, despite israeli objections over a deal with the islamic republic. ""this is a vital security interest to both israel and the united states, and i would add for the rest of the world as well,"" biden said at a news conference in jerusalem standing alongside israeli prime minister yair lapid. he added, ""i continue to believe that diplomacy is the best way to achieve this outcome. we will continue to work with israel to counter other threats from iran throughout the region, including support for terrorism and ballistic missile program that continues and the proliferation of weapons to terrorist and proxies like hezbollah."" the president said he would deliver that message to saudi leadership when he travels to saudi arabia on friday and said, ""with regard to iran and convincing the saudis and others that we mean what we say is -- we mean what we say."" biden has pushed for a revival of the iran nuclear deal, which former president donald trump withdrew the us from in 2018, as he faces increasing pressure from key middle east allies to produce a plan to contain iran. biden's hosts in israel oppose a new iran nuclear deal and the previous version of the deal was unpopular in that nation. but hopes appear to be fading that the deal will materialize, and the president on thursday acknowledged the us is ""not going to wait forever"" for a response from iranian leadership. standing alongside biden at the news conference, lapid was dismissive about another nuclear deal as the means to prevent iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. ""words will not stop them, mr.president. diplomacy will not stop them.the only thing that will stopiran is knowing that if theycontinue to develop theirnuclear program, the free worldwill use force.the only way to stop them is toput a credible military threaton the table,"" lapid said. biden said in an interview with israel's channel 12 news that aired wednesday that he would use force ""as a last resort"" to keep iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, but did not spell out what that meant. iran was a main topic of discussion during biden and lapid's bilateral meeting on thursday, and the two leaders signed a new joint declaration on thursday aimed at expanding the security relationship between their nations and countering what they described as efforts by iran to destabilize the region. the president reiterated the us' ""ironclad commitment"" to israel's security. the president expressed support for the abraham accords, one of trump's legacy achievements that normalized relations between israel and several arab countries and pursued an expansion of growing arab-israeli security and economic ties. he also emphasized the us' support of expanding israel's integration into the region -- a major theme of biden's four-day trip to the middle east. biden also reiterated his support for a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinianconflict during the news conference. ""israel must remain an independent, democratic jewish state, the ultimate guarantee and guarantor of security of the jewish people not only in israel but the entire world. i believe that to my core,"" biden said. he continued, ""and the best way to achieve that remains a two-state solution for two people, both of whom have deep and ancient roots in this land living side-by-side in peace and security. both states fully respecting the equal rights of their citizens, both people enjoying equal measures of freedom and any more that takes us further from that outcome i believe anything is detrimental to the long-term security of israel."" the us and israel on thursday also launched a new high-level strategic dialogue on technology, which officials say is designed to elevate cooperation between the two nations on pandemic preparedness, climate technology, artificial technology and other trusted technology ecosystems. the president on thursday also participated in the first virtual leaders meeting of the ""i2u2"" group, which also includes israel, india, and the united arab emirates. the focus of thursday's meeting was food security as well as advancing clean energy, biden said ahead of the meeting. the uae announced it was investing $2 billion in agricultural parks in india to tackle the food security crisis. ""this unique grouping of countries aims to harness the vibrancy of our societies and entrepreneurial spirit to tackle some of the greatest challenges confronting our world, with a particular focus on joint investments and new initiatives in water, energy, transportation, space, health, and food security,"" a joint statement from the leaders of india, israel, united arab emirates and the united states reads. biden met with president isaac herzog of israel at his residence and was set to discuss herzog's diplomatic efforts to further integrate israel into the region, officials said. herzog presented biden with the israeli presidential medal of honor, and biden said the award was ""among the greatest honors of my career."" the president will then meet with former prime minister benjamin netanyahu. the two leaders have a relationship that spans nearly four decades that began when biden was a junior senator. all the same, it has not always been smooth sailing between the two men. netanyahu made no secret of his disregard for former president barack obama -- the feeling, by all accounts, was mutual -- and biden was badly embarrassed when a visit to israel as vice president in 2010 coincided with an israeli government announcement approving plans for new settlement homes. ""they, of course, go back many years and know each other well. and we are clear during this visit that the relationship between the united states and israel is about the countries, our strategic partnership as two states -- not about individual leaders,"" one official said. biden also met with us athletes competing in the maccabiah games, an international jewish and israeli multi-sport event, and viewed a portion of the opening ceremonies. this story has been updated with additional developments on thursday.",2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.4626411381565655,0.46839442988857627,0.013408872661077313,-0.4585591988983273,0,0,0,0,-0.9171183977966546,-1.2508028705485796,8.0,-0.15635035881857245
Fist bumps instead of handshakes: Biden looks to 'minimize contact' in Israel and Saudi Arabia,2022-07-13,72.0,"president joe biden was greeted in israel on wednesday by a row of israeli leaders offering open palms to the president. biden offered a closed fist in exchange. the president doled out fist bumps and pats on the shoulder to the delegation stationed along the red carpet at the foot of air force one, which the white house said was part of an effort to reduce physical contact amid the rapid spread of a new coronavirus variant. but only minutes later, biden broke with the new effort -- exchanging a hearty handshake with the former israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu, the current opposition leader. biden later also clasped hands with a pair of holocaust survivors at yad vashem. the president's half-hearted effort to reduce physical contact on his trip to the middle east was a jolting switch for biden, who has been shaking plenty of hands in the days leading up to his trip. and it raised questions about whether the white house was trying to avoid the optics of biden shaking hands with saudi arabia's crown prince mohammad bin salman, whom biden will meet for the first time on friday. biden has been facing questions about that meeting after saying as a candidate he would make saudi arabia a ""pariah"" for the killing of journalist jamal khashoggi. the cia has alleged that khashoggi was killed in an operation approved by bin salman. pressed by reporters aboard air force one, white house press secretary karine jean-pierre denied that was the reason for the attempt at reduced physical contact. ""we are saying that we're going to try to minimize contact as much as possible. but also, there are precautions that we are taking because this is up to his doctor. ba.4, ba.5 is indeed, as we're seeing, increasing. and we want to make sure that we're taking those precautions to keep him safe and to keep all of us safe,"" jean-pierre said, referring to emerging coronavirus variants. jean-pierre said there was not a ""new policy"" around not hand-shaking but said biden would be taking ""extra precautions."" ""we're in a phase of the pandemic now where we are seeking to reduce contact and to increase masking, as we're standing here masked before you, to minimize spread,"" the national security adviser jake sullivan said on wednesday. ""i can't speak to, you know, every moment and every interaction and every movement. that's just kind of the general principle we're applying here."" the ba.5 variant became dominant in the us last week, according to data from the us centers for disease control and prevention, and epidemiologists have warned of a rise in cases and hospitalizations in the coming weeks. during a visit to yad vashem, israel's holocaust memorial site, biden also held hands with two holocaust survivors. biden went over to talk to 86-year-old rena quint and 95-year-old gita cycowicz at the conclusion of a wreath-laying ceremony in the hall of remembrance. both women held on to biden's arm at different points in the exchange, which seemed to go on for longer than officials anticipated. ""did you see the president hug me?"" quint said later. ""he asked permission to kiss me, and he kept on holding my hand and we were told not to touch him!"" biden's attempt to reduce physical contact marked an abrupt shift. on monday, biden shook hands with lawmakers and gun safety advocates at a white house event, and on tuesday he was seen embracing and shaking hands with members of congress at the congressional picnic. and last week, biden shook hands, embraced supporters and took selfies at an event in cleveland.",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.04161910393408366,0.5666769444942474,0.17741824899400982,0.3501682880187611,0,0,0,0,0.3501682880187611,-1.1045677171263044,8.0,-0.13807096464078805
What not to expect from Biden's Jerusalem trip,2022-07-11,73.0,"it has taken president joe biden, who arrives in jerusalem this week at the start of a short regional trip to the middle east, almost eighteen months to schedule a visit to the holy city. after that he will travel to saudi arabia. by contrast, his predecessor donald trump made jerusalem one of his first foreign destinations, visiting four months after taking office. biden, though, has sought to remove some of the intensity around the previous administration's embrace of israel, as well as to recalibrate relations with the palestinians. nothing too dramatic, though; the white house has made it clear from the start it has no interest in investing any political capital in re-starting peace negotiations. the president's visit also comes less than a month after the collapse of the latest israeli government, a development that will have only reinforced the belief in washington this is not a time to kick start israeli-palestinian diplomacy. instead, expect attention on israel's growing regional relationships, and a focus on the palestinian economy. new prime minister yair lapid will be the man welcoming biden to israel, but the american visitor is also making time to meet with benjamin netanyahu, who opinion polls suggest could be poised for a comeback. look closely when the president shakes hands with the former israeli premier, and the shadow of trump might - ever so slightly - be present in the room. for more on what to expect from biden's visit to israel and the palestinian territories, cnn spoke to former us ambassador to israel dan shapiro. how does biden's israel policy differ from his predecessors', especially regarding jerusalem as israel's undivided capital, the golan heights, and settlements? biden strongly believes that the only possible solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict is an agreement for two states, living in peace and security. he has maintained trump's move of the us embassy to jerusalem, in recognition of israel's capital. but he has also pledged to reestablish the separate us consulate to conduct diplomacy with the palestinians that trump closed, and he is mindful that resolving both sides' claims in jerusalem can only be done at the negotiating table. with the civil war in syria grinding on and iran seeking to threaten israel with weapons based there, there is no serious possibility of israeli-syrian negotiations. so biden sees nothing on the horizon that raises any question about israel's control of the golan heights, and no reason to delve into the question of sovereignty. unlike some of his predecessors, biden is yet to appoint a special envoy to the middle east one year into his presidency. what does this say about the importance he attaches to solving the middle east conflict? that likely reflects the realistic appraisal that israeli and palestinian domestic political dynamics make a breakthrough exceedingly unlikely, as well as the elevation of other priorities, like competing with china, revitalizing nato, and now, helping ukraine repel russia's invasion. in the meantime, the biden administration supports steps that strengthen the palestinian economy, reduce friction between israelis and palestinians, and limit actions by either side — like settlement expansion and payments to terrorists [through the palestinian authority martyr's fund] — that can make an eventual solution even harder to achieve. if the us wants to get something from israel in regard to a political solution for the palestinians, what can biden offer in return? i don't think biden is trying to coax a particular action or decision out of israel on a political horizon. in this phase, when there are no negotiations, it is more about keeping prospects for two states alive for a negotiation that would come later. even while normalization with arab states advances, which he fully supports, the palestinian issue continues to resonate in much of the arab world and will affect prospects for new countries to join. is israel likely to make any gestures towards the palestinians ahead of biden's trip? israelis are newly focused on another election, their fifth in less than four years. even though the new acting prime minister, yair lapid, is more moderate on the palestinian issue than either outgoing prime minister naftali bennett or his longtime predecessor benjamin netanyahu, israeli election campaigns are not a time when gestures to the palestinians are most likely. biden is scheduled to meet with netanyahu, the leader of the opposition. since netanyahu is strongly associated with the trump presidency, how much of a setback would it be for the biden administration to find netanyahu installed again as israel's prime minister, if at all? there is nothing unusual about a friendly stay-in-touch meeting between a visiting american president and the opposition leader of a democratic ally. with netanyahu, there could be more policy differences than with lapid, particularly sharper disagreements around the palestinian issue and iran nuclear negotiations. but such differences are not new in us-israel relations. biden will be careful not to wade into domestic israeli politics. do you expect biden to bring up the killing of shireen abu akleh during the visit, or is the case considered closed as far as the us is concerned? shireen abu akleh's tragic death remains a subject of concern for the us because she was a us citizen and because of the priority placed on journalists being able to do their jobs safely. while the outcome of the us investigation about who was responsible for her killing was inconclusive [but added that israeli military gunfire was ""likely responsible"" for her death], the biden administration continues to push for accountability. the subject is not going away, although neither the israelis nor the palestinians are likely to be satisfied with the us position. this interview has been edited for length and clarity. the digest family of slain palestinian-american journalist demand meeting with biden the family of slain palestinian-american reporter shireen abu akleh on friday sent a strongly worded letter to united states president joe biden accusing the us government of ""an apparent effort to undermine our efforts towards justice and accountability,"" and demanding a meeting with the president during his visit to the region this week. background: abu akleh was shot dead in may while covering an israeli military operation in the west bank city of jenin. several news organizations, including cnn, as well as the united nations, published investigations into her death concluding that the bullet that killed her was most likely fired from an israeli soldier's gun. earlier this month, the palestinian authority handed over the bullet that killed abu akleh to the us. it was examined by israeli experts with us army officials present, according to an israeli army statement. the us state department said it ""could not reach a definitive conclusion"" regarding who fired the fatal bullet but that gunfire from israeli army positions ""was likely responsible."" why it matters: the abu akleh family's letter concluded with an appeal to biden, asking that he ""meet with us during your upcoming visit and hear directly from us about our concerns and demands for justice."" at friday's white house briefing, spokesperson karine jean-pierre said she had not read the family's letter and would not be drawn on any possible meeting, but added, ""we hear their concerns, we feel their pain."" biden defends decision to visit saudi arabia biden on saturday defended his controversial visit to saudi arabia later this week, saying the trip is critical to the security of the united states. ""as president, it is my job to keep our country strong and secure,"" biden wrote saturday in an op-ed for the washington post. background: the president's visit has drawn criticism given that us intelligence has deemed saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman responsible for ordering the murder of dissident journalist jamal khashoggi (bin salman has denied involvement). as a candidate for president, biden had pledged to make the kingdom a ""pariah."" why it matters: the trip comes as russia's war in ukraine has oil prices skyrocketing and global trade disrupted. biden said he will be focused on a more integrated and stable middle east, calling the region ""essential to global trade and the supply chains we rely on"" while also noting how critical middle eastern energy supplies are in light of sanctions on russia. iran says us-backed regional military alliance will increase tensions a us-backed israeli-arab military alliance will only exacerbate regional tensions, the iranian foreign ministry said on saturday as us president joe biden gears up for a visit to the middle east. background: israel is working with regional partners on an air defense alliance led by the us, israeli defense minister benny gantz said last month. the air defense systems would defend against rockets, cruise missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles, gantz said. iranian foreign ministry spokesperson nasser kanaani said on saturday the plan was a ""provocative move"" and that iran sees it ""as a threat against its national security,"" according to the state news agency irna. kaani added that the us is raising the issue ""with the aim of sowing the seeds of discord and spreading iranophobia among regional countries,"" added irna. why it matters: the us has been keen to reassure its middle east allies of its determination to combat attacks by iran or its armed proxies in the region. but middle eastern nations, particularly saudi arabia, have expressed concern over an emboldened iran if sanctions are lifted after a possible nuclear deal with tehran. what's trending egypt: #unlimited_internet_in_egypt a social media campaign urging egypt's government and internet providers to offer unlimited internet access on home services has been trending, with many expressing outrage over usage quotas and slow speeds. egypt's major internet providers offer limited home-service data bundles at varying speeds with usage caps. many countries in the region removed data caps for home usage years ago. ""the internet has now become our life,"" tweeted famed actor and comedian mohamed henedy to his 13 million followers. ""unlimited internet is now a huge necessity for the future."" the issue was taken up by parliament last week, reported state-backed media, and will be discussed amid nationwide pleas. despite the restrictions, the country of about 100 million has high internet penetration. the world bank estimates that around 72% of egypt's population was using the internet as of 2020, when the global pandemic first peaked. that's higher than the internet penetration of italy and china. usage in egypt was up from 57% in 2019. earlier this year, communications minister amr talaat said ",5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.29390568658709526,0.5163128614425659,0.18978147841989995,-0.25286726175141955,0,0,0,0,-1.2643363087570978,-1.7089054015861114,12.0,-0.14240878346550928
Opinion: Biden is heading to the Middle East for one simple reason,2022-07-10,74.0,"presidential visits to the middle east come in all different shapes and sizes. exhausted and ill but enamored of kings, deserts and oil, president franklin d. roosevelt met king ibn saud, founder of modern saudi arabia, on his way home from yalta in 1945. in 1974, richard nixon, the first sitting us president to visit both israel and the arab states, took what proved to be a farewell foray two months before he resigned the presidency. and, in what was surely a president's most consequential middle east visit, jimmy carter gambled on traveling to egypt and israel in february 1979 to close a peace treaty signed a month later. president joe biden's brief middle east visit, which starts on wednesday, reflects a desire to show that a busy administration -- preoccupied with domestic travails and foreign policy challenges dominated by russia and china -- still cares about the region. but the trip's main focus -- improving us relations with saudi arabia -- can't obscure the reality that, without the roiled global oil market resulting from russia's invasion of ukraine, the president might not be traveling to the region at all, and certainly not to a country he once deemed a pariah nation. the president's visit reflects less a strategic shift in administration thinking about a troubled region and more an effort at short term crisis management. indeed, biden will find a region filled with problems -- iran and the israeli-palestinian conflict -- he can't resolve and one that is wary of america's own staying power and stability. a stop in israel before the midterms the idea of a presidential visit to the middle east began with an april phone call with then-israeli prime minister naftali bennett in which biden accepted an invitation to visit israel ""in coming months."" the president had bet heavily on the bennett government (now defunct with new elections set for november 1) and had given it wide room to maneuver on a few key issues -- such as the reopening of the jerusalem consulate and israel's effort to maintain good relations with russia -- all to prevent the coalition's collapse and the return of former prime minister benjamin netanyahu, who's currently on trial and has pleaded not guilty to one charge of bribery and three charges of fraud and breach of trust. indeed, netanyahu has always preferred republicans to democrats, blatantly intervening in us domestic politics and collaborating with them to oppose us policies, especially on iran. biden seemed determined to avoid the tensions between his former boss president barack obama and israel, especially in public. he had said as vice president that there was ""no daylight"" between israel and the us, especially on security. obama had visited egypt during his first year and failed to stop in israel. and biden, whose support for israel runs deep in his emotional and political dna, wasn't going to pass up an invitation from an israeli prime minister to visit early in his first term. the trip would also provide an opportunity to talk about iran -- israel's greatest challenge. and as my grandmother used to say about her chicken soup: a presidential visit months before the midterms certainly couldn't hurt the president's politics. a peace process not ready for prime time biden has very realistic views about the grim prospects for israeli-palestinian peace, telling the un in september 2021 that a two-state solution is a ""long way away."" but the flare-up of violence in may 2021 between israel and hamas and tensions over jerusalem had drawn the president in and compelled the administration to at least pay more attention to the problem. biden ought to make it unmistakably clear to both sides to avoid provocative steps that might trigger violence. biden will meet with palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas, whose approval rating among palestinians is about even with hamas' and lower than biden's at home. one can imagine biden will say all the right things about the importance of a two-state solution, palestinians rights and how both sides need to avoid steps that might prejudice a final deal. and abbas will likely press biden on reopening the consulate in jerusalem and the plo office in washington, in addition to stopping israeli settlements. but domestic politics in the us and israel will constrain biden's ability and willingness to do much more than offer up modest, confidence-building measures. he ought to make it unmistakably clear to both sides to avoid provocative steps that might trigger violence. and an unpopular abbas, now in the 17th year of an originally four-year term is too weak to offer up much on his own. in short, serious progress on the israeli-palestinian issue just isn't ready for prime time. crude diplomacy the president has maintained that oil is not the primary reason for his visit to saudi arabia. but let's be clear, biden would not likely be going there now were it not for russia's invasion of ukraine and its impact on the global oil market. the president, though, is wise to play down the oil factor largely because the saudis are likely unwilling or unable to ramp up production enough to have an impact on what biden cares about most: lowering gas prices that are dragging down his approval ratings before the midterms. as far as oil is concerned, this trip is an investment in the future, specifically the hope that an improvement in us-saudi ties will facilitate the saudis increasing production later this year and into the next. biden is clearly conflicted about the trip, having called saudi arabia a pariah nation whose leadership has ""little social redeeming value."" biden keeps insisting that he's not going to meet saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman, known as mbs, one on one and insists that he will only be there as part of a larger meeting. the administration has been working to facilitate an improvement in israeli-saudi relations, perhaps in an effort to offset the impact of the meeting with mbs. but the us ambassador to israel thomas nides opined this week that normalization of relations between the two countries will not happen on this trip. it's doubtful that anything short of a full-throated acceptance of responsibility for saudi journalist jamal khashoggi's murder would mitigate the intense opposition to mbs from congress, the media and the human rights community. almost four years after khashoggi's murder and dismemberment, which a us intelligence report found to have happened at the orders of mbs, there's still no accounting or accountability. apart from the khashoggi murder, saudi arabia's human rights record reads like a chapter out of an edgar allan poe horror story. mbs has proven himself to be a ruthless authoritarian. to be credible, especially in light of his tough comments about mbs, biden ought to speak out publicly in saudi arabia about the importance he attaches to saudi arabia ending its human rights abuses and set expectations that he intends to follow this issue personally. indeed, whatever the president achieves in saudi arabia, the us-saudi relationship will remain a troubled one. the middle east is looking past biden eighteen months into the biden administration, there's still much uncertainty in the region about biden's staying power. israel and the gulf states see washington dealing with other priorities: china, russia and, of course, the fraught state of america's domestic politics. america is back, but for how long? the saudis want security guarantees; israel desires assurances that the us plans to help them stop iran from going nuclear and spreading its nefarious influence in the region. america isn't withdrawing from the region and is prepared to strengthen cooperation with israel and the gulf states, especially on an integrated air defense system against missiles and drones. but biden should tread carefully in both israel and saudi arabia and not give binding assurances that could result in an escalatory cycle drawing the us into an unwanted war with iran. but biden's real priorities lie elsewhere. at the same time, israel and the arab nations read the political map in washington and see the prospect of republican gains in the midterms and the very real possibility that biden, who will turn 80 in november, might be a one-term president. this is particularly true of mbs -- as well as netanyahu, who has a shot at becoming israel's next prime minister. the saudis have been hedging their bets and recently contributed $2 billion to trump's son-in-law jared kushner's new investment fund. given the royal treatment the saudis received from trump and kushner during the last administration, it's no surprise. the saudis financed the livgolf association, which opens this month in the us and has two tournaments scheduled at trump's properties. as for netanyahu, who has always favored republicans over democrats and has never been reluctant to show it, nothing would make him happier than to see trump return as president. despite some tension, trump bonded with

tenure. us president joe biden said he was ""stunned, outraged, and deeply saddened,"" adding he had worked closely with abe and his killing was ""a tragedy for japan and all who knew him."" shootings are extremely rare in japan because of strict gun ownership laws:in 2018, japan, a country of 125 million people, only reportednine deathsfrom firearms — compared with39,740that year in the united states. underjapan's firearms laws, the only guns permitted for sale are shotguns and air rifles — handguns are outlawed. but getting them is a long and complicated process that requires strenuous effort — and lots of patience. the laws and the thorough process of background checks have kept the number of private gun owners in japan extremely low. ##catch up## japan's former prime minister shinzo abe diedafter being shotduring a campaign speech friday in nara. he was 67. abe served two separate terms as the japanese leader for the right-leaningliberal democratic party (ldp) — the first from 2006 to 2007, then again from 2012 until 2020. his second stint was the longest consecutive term for a japanese head of government. he came from a family of japanese prime ministers: abe was born on sept. 21, 1954, in tokyo, to a prominent political family. both his grandfather and great uncle served as prime minister, and his father was a former secretary general of the ldp. abe was first elected to japan's house of representatives in 1993, at age 38. he held a number of cabinet positions throughout the 2000s, and in 2003 became secretary general of the ldp. four years later, he was named the party's president and became prime minister of japan. his first term was marred by controversies and worsening health, and he stepped down as party leader and prime minister in 2007. the end of abe's first term opened a revolving door in which five different men held the prime minister post in five years until his re-election in 2012.he stepped down in 2020 citing ill health. he continued to be an influential leader after leaving office: after leaving office, abe remained head of the largest faction of the ruling ldp and remained influential within the party. he has continued to campaign for a stronger security policy and last year angered china by calling for a greater commitment from allies to defend democracy in taiwan. in response, beijing summoned japan's ambassador and accused abe of openly challenging china's sovereignty. abe redefined japan's diplomatic and military policy: abe will be remembered for boosting defense spending and pushing through the most dramatic shift in japanese military policy in 70 years. in 2015, his government passed a reinterpretation of japan's postwar, pacifist constitution, allowing japanese troops to engage in overseas combat — with conditions — for the first time since world war ii. abe argued the change was needed to respond to a more challenging security environment, a nod to a more assertive china and frequent missile tests in north korea. during his term, abe sought to improve relations with beijing and held a historic phone call with chinese leader xi jinping in 2018. at the same time, he tried to counter chinese expansion in the region by uniting pacific allies. he attempted to build a personal relationship with former united states president donald trump. as washington's relationship with pyongyangtipped toward diplomacy, with both trump and south korean president moonjae-in holding historic summits with north korean leader kim jong un, abe said he was ""determined"" to meet kim. abe wanted to normalize relations with north korea and ease tensions on the korean peninsula, but his first priority was to bring some closure for the families of japanese citizens abducted by north korea in the 1970s and 80s. during his tenure, japan's relations with south korea soured. the two countries were engaged in a major dispute in which trade and military intelligence deals were scrapped, partly due to the legacy of world war ii and japan's brutal colonization of the korean peninsula. ""abenomics"": abe came to office during a time of economic turmoil and soon set about rebooting japan's economy after decades of stagnation. soon after he was re-elected prime minister in 2012, he launched a grand experiment popularly known as ""abenomics."" it included three so-called arrows — massive monetary stimulus, increased government spending, and structural reforms. after a strong start, it faltered and in 2015, abefired""three new arrows"" designed to boost gross domestic product. any hopes they might eventually hit their mark were dashed when covid-19 swept through the country in 2020, tipping japan into recession. one of abe's major domestic achievements was securing the 2020 tokyo olympics. but the success of the much anticipated tokyo games was ultimately undone by the covid-19 pandemic, which forced the competition to be postponed to 2021. abe declared a state of emergency months after the first cases were detected. his administration was also criticized for the low rate of testing, and an early lack of specialist medical equipment to treat the rising number of patients. more successful was abe's handling of the abdication of emperor akihito, the first japanese monarch to step down in two centuries. he was succeeded by his son, emperor naruhito, in october 2019, starting the reiwa era. abe is survived by his wife akie abe, née matsuzaki, who he married in 1987. the couple did not have children. read more about his legacyhereand see his life in photoshere. tributes to shinzo abe have poured in from politicians around the world, many of whom

national police agency. a total of 10 firearm-related incidents were reported in the country in 2021 — up from seven in 2020. eight of the 10 reported incidents were gang-related, the agency's report states. in the past five years, the highest number of firearm-related deaths per year reported in japan was four. the data indicates just how rare gun violence is in japan, which can be credited to its strict gun ownership laws and thorough background check processes. in 2018, japan, a country of 125 million people, only reportednine deathsfrom firearms — compared with39,740that year in the united states. under japan's firearms laws, the only guns permitted for sale are shotguns and air rifles — handguns are outlawed. but getting them is a long and complicated process that requires

inspected by the police once a year, and gun owners must retake the class and sit an exam every three years to renew their license. read more about japan's gun lawshere. shinzo abe, who died on friday after being shot in nara, served two separate terms as japanese leader for the right-leaningliberal democratic party (ldp) he first served from 2006 to 2007, then again from 2012 until 2020. his second stint was the longest consecutive term for a japanese head of government. worsening china ties:during his term, abe sought to improve relations with beijing, while trying to counter chinese expansion in the region by uniting pacific allies. after leaving office, abe remained head of the largest faction of the ruling ldp and maintained influence within the party. last year, he angered china by calling for a greater commitment from allies to defend democracy in taiwan. in response, beijing summoned japan's ambassador and accused abe of openly challenging china's sovereignty. spat with south korea:tokyo's ties with beijing and seoul also soured during abe's time in office.japan and south korea were engaged in a major dispute in which trade and military intelligence deals were scrapped, partly due to the legacy of world war ii and japan's brutal colonization of the korean peninsula. moving toward the us:abe was a prominent figure on the world stage, attempting to build a personal relationship with then-us president donald trump. he traveled to new york to meet the newly elected republican president while former president barack obama was still in office — trump's first meeting with any world leader. at home in japan: kazuto suzuki, professor of public policy at hokkaido university, said abe “very successfully transformed japan into a modern state fitting into this globalizing world ... after the subprime crisis,"" adding that the former prime minister helped to recover the country from deflation through “abenomics.” suzuki said abe also tried to change the constitution. although he was not successful, ""he introduced the legislation on peace and security, which allows the partial implementation of the collective self-defense, which were for the last 70 years was not allowed to have under the interpretation of our constitution,” he said. read abe's

and security personnel from the tokyo metropolitan police had remained on the lookout and had reportedly watched abe from all sides during his speech, nhk reported. the police agency did not state how many officers had been deployed to the site. however, it said several dozen, including one specially assigned personnel from the tokyo police force and the nara prefecture's plain-clothed police officers were on duty, nhk reported. japan's former prime minister shinzo abe diedafter being shotduring a campaign speech friday in nara. he was 67. abe served two separate terms as the japanese leader for the right-leaningliberal democratic party (ldp) — the first from 2006 to 2007, then again from 2012 until 2020. his second stint was the longest consecutive term for a japanese head of government. he came from a family of japanese prime ministers abe was born on sept. 21, 1954, in tokyo, to a prominent political family. both his grandfather and great uncle served as prime minister, and his father was a former secretary general of the ldp. abe was first elected to japan's house of representatives in 1993, at age 38. he held a number of cabinet positions throughout the 2000s, and in 2003 became secretary general of the ldp. four years later, he was named the party's president and became prime minister of japan. his first term was marred by controversies and worsening health, and he stepped down as party leader and prime minister in 2007. the end of abe's first term opened a revolving door in which five different men held the prime minister post in five years until his re-election in 2012.he stepped down in 2020 citing ill health. he continued to be an influential leader after leaving office after leaving office, abe remained head of the largest faction of the ruling ldp and remained influential within the party. he has continued to campaign for a stronger security policy and last year angered china by calling for a greater commitment from allies to defend democracy in taiwan. in response, beijing summoned japan's ambassador and accused abe of openly challenging china's sovereignty. abe redefined japan's diplomatic and military policy abe will be remembered for boosting defense spending and pushing through the most dramatic shift in japanese military policy in 70 years. in 2015, his government passed a reinterpretation of japan's postwar, pacifist constitution, allowing japanese troops to engage in overseas combat — with conditions — for the first time since world war ii. abe argued the change was needed to respond to a more challenging security environment, a nod to a more assertive china and frequent missile tests in north korea. during his term, abe sought to improve relations with beijing and held a historic phone call with chinese leader xi jinping in 2018. at the same time, he tried to counter chinese expansion in the region by uniting pacific allies. he attempted to build a personal relationship with former united states president donald trump. as washington's relationship with pyongyang tipped toward diplomacy, with both trump and south korean president moon jae-in holding historic summits with north korean leader kim jong un, abe said he was ""determined"" to meet kim. abe wanted to normalize relations with north korea and ease tensions on the korean peninsula, but his first priority was to bring some closure for the families of japanese citizens abducted by north korea in the 1970s and 80s. during his tenure, japan's relations with south korea soured. the two countries were engaged in a major dispute in which trade and military intelligence deals were scrapped, partly due to the legacy of world war ii and japan's brutal colonization of the korean peninsula. the ""abenomics"" abe came to office during a time of economic turmoil and soon set about rebooting japan's economy after decades of stagnation. soon after he was re-elected prime minister in 2012, he launched a grand experiment popularly known as ""abenomics."" it included three so-called arrows — massive monetary stimulus, increased government spending, and structural reforms. after a strong start, it faltered and in 2015, abefired""three new arrows"" designed to boost gross domestic product. any hopes they might eventually hit their mark were dashed when covid-19 swept through the country in 2020, tipping japan into recession. one of abe's major domestic achievements was securing the 2020 tokyo olympics. but the success of the much anticipated tokyo games was ultimately undone by the covid-19 pandemic, which forced the competition to be postponed to 2021. abe declared a state of emergency months after the first cases were detected. his administration was also criticized for the low rate of testing, and an early lack of specialist medical equipment to treat the rising number of patients. more successful was abe's handling of the abdication of emperor akihito, the first japanese monarch to step down in two centuries. he was succeeded by his son, emperor naruhito, in october 2019, starting the reiwa era. abe is survived by his wife akie abe, née matsuzaki, who he married in 1987. the couple did not have children. read more about his legacy here and see his life in photos here. us president joe biden is ordering flags to be lowered to half-staff until july 10 following the death of former japanese prime minister shinzo abe, writing in a presidential proclamation that the late pm “was a proud servant of the japanese people and a faithful friend to the united states.” “he worked with american presidents of both parties to deepen the alliance between our nations and advance a common vision for a free and open indo-pacific,” biden wrote friday. “even in the moment he was attacked and killed, he was engaged in the work of democracy, to which he dedicated his life.” biden also signed a condolence book for abe at the japanese ambassador’s residence in washington, dc. he laid a

pellish contributed reporting for this post. correction:a earlier version of this post incorrectly described where biden signed a condolence book for abe. it was at the japanese ambassador's residence. tributes to shinzo abe have continued to pour in from politicians around the world, many of whom recalled their visits with the former leader and expressed their shock at his killing. french president emmanuel macron said “japan has lost a great prime minister."" “on behalf of the french people, i send my condolences to the japanese authorities and people after the assassination of

""abenomics was, in verysimple terms, a throw-it-all, buy-it-all strategy to try andstimulate growth.so, put massive spending intotheeconomy, buy up governmentbonds,also implement economicreforms,"" cnn's anna stewart explained. ""it was a way of trying to getmass employment, make peoplewealthier so they could spendmore money, and just try andget theeconomyticking."" ""during his premiership, you sawthe bank of japan push interestrates into negative territory,"" she said, adding that such a move was extremely unconventional at the time combined with ""huge quantitative easing."" since then, such a move hasbecome much more conventional,particularly in recent yearssince the pandemic with allsorts of central banks aroundthe world — the us federalreserve, the ecb, thebank of england — all doingsimilar moves, she added. abenomics was successful aswell — at least for the first fewyears, according to experts, stewart noted.

september 21, 1954, in tokyo, to a prominent political family. both his grandfather and great uncle served as prime minister, and his father was a former secretary general of the right-leaningliberal democratic party (ldp). he studied politics at tokyo's seiki university and the university of southern california, but initially entered business, taking a position with kobe steel in 1979. three years later, he became an assistant to the minister for foreign affairs. abe was first elected to japan's house of representatives in 1993, at age 38. he held a number of cabinet positions throughout the 2000s, and in 2003 became secretary general of the ldp. four years later, he was named the party's president and became prime minister of japan. his first term was marred by controversies and worsening health, and he stepped down as party leader and prime minister in 2007. the end of abe's first term opened a revolving door in which five different men held the prime minister post in five years until his re-election in 2012.he stepped down in 2020 citing ill health. abe died on friday age 67 after being shot in nara. read more about abe's life and career. shinzo abe, who died on friday

second stint was the longest consecutive term for a japanese head of government. worsening china ties: during his term, abe sought to improve relations with beijing, while trying to counter chinese expansion in the region by uniting pacific allies. after leaving office, abe remained head of the largest faction of the ruling ldp and maintained influence within the party. last year, he angered china by calling for a greater commitment from allies to defend democracy in taiwan. in response, beijing summoned japan's ambassador and accused abe of openly challenging china's sovereignty. spat with south korea: tokyo's ties with beijing and seoul also soured during abe's time in office. japan and south korea were engaged in a major dispute in which trade and military intelligence deals were scrapped, partly due to the legacy of world war ii and japan's brutal colonization of the korean peninsula. moving toward the us: abe was a prominent figure on the world stage, attempting to build a personal relationship with then-us president donald trump. he traveled to new york to meet the newly elected republican president while former president barack obama was still in office — trump's first meeting with any world leader. read abe's obituary here. nato secretary general jens stoltenberg sent his “deepest condolences” to the family of assassinated former japanese prime minister

in 2018, japan only reported nine deaths from firearms, compared with 39,740 that year in the united states. under japan's firearms laws, the only guns permitted for sale are shotguns and air rifles — handguns are outlawed. but getting them is a long and complicated process that requires strenuous effort — and lots of patience. to buy a gun in japan, potential buyers must attend an all-day class, pass a written test and a shooting-range test with an accuracy of at least 95%. they also must undergo mental health evaluation and drug tests, as well as a rigorous background check — including a review of their criminal record, personal debt, involvement in organized crime and relationships with family and friends. in 2019, only an estimated 310,400 guns were held by civilians in japan, in a country of 125 million people. in 2007, the mayor of nagasaki in southern japan, iccho ito, died after being shot at least twice in the back by an alleged gangster. since then, japan has furthered tightened its gun control law, imposing heavier punishments for gun crimes committed by members of organized crime gangs. watch more on this here. japan's chief cabinet secretary hirokazu matsuno has

""abe shinzo is one of the great leaders of our times. right now we must hope and pray that he pulls through,"" turnbull wrote. turnbull served as prime minister from 2015 to 2018, while abe was prime minister of japan. photos posted on social media friday show a suspect being held down on the ground, his arms restrained. police have arrested a man on suspicion of attempted murder and retrieved a gun, according to japanese public broadcaster nhk. shinzo abe collapsed during a speech in nara city at around 11:30 a.m. local time, and appeared to be bleeding after a possible gunshot in his back, according to japan’s public broadcaster nhk. according to an official of the liberal democratic party abe faction, abe was shot in the chest and carried away by an ambulance, nhk reported. police have arrested a man on suspicion of attempted murder and retrieved a gun. abe arrived in nara from haneda airport via osaka airport to give an election campaign speech on the street, to support liberal democratic party (ldp) candidates ahead of the upcoming upper house elections scheduled for sunday, according to nhk. he had planned to head to kyoto afterward, then to saitama prefecture, which neighbors the capital tokyo. nhk tv is reporting that abe is moved to nara medical university. cnn has not been able to independently verify these reports. an official from the nara city fire department official said a man collapsed while giving a speech today, and that man has been transported by ambulance to hospital — but the official said he cannot disclose the man's identity or medical status. shinzo abe was the longest-serving japanese prime minister in history before he stepped down in 2020, citing health reasons. abe has colitis, a non-curable inflammatory bowel disease, whichwas also a factorin his sudden resignation as prime minister in 2007, ending his first term after just over a year in office. ""for almost eight years i controlled my chronic disease, however, this year in june i had a regular check-up and there was a sign of the disease,"" he said in august 2020, when announcing his resignation. serving multiple terms: abe's first term was marred by controversies and worsening health, and he stepped down as party leader and prime minister in 2007, eventually returning to both positions in 2012. following his return as leader, he became the dominant force in japanese politics, winning alandslide third term in 2017and afourth in 2019. an aerial photo shows emergency vehicles at the scene in nara, and a small crowd gathered on the sidewalk. shinzo abe, the former japanese prime minister, had been in the city for a speech on friday. shinzo abe, the former prime minister of japan, was rushed to the hospital on friday afternoon after a possible shooting during a speech in the city of nara, according to public broadcaster nhk. nara is located just east of osaka. abe served as prime minister from 2006 to 2007 and again from 2012 to 2020.",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.010260570380422803,0.09270859316543296,0.4155493665624548,0.518518492126418,0,0,0,0,0.518518492126418,-0.18623625487936246,14.0,-0.013302589634240176
Israeli and Palestinian leaders speak by phone for the first time in years,2022-07-08,78.0,"israel's new prime minister yair lapid and the palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas held a phone conversation friday morning, which is believed to be the first such contact between israeli and palestinian leaders for five years. a short statement from lapid's office said the two men ""spoke about the continuation of cooperation and the need to ensure quiet and calm."" abbas had congratulated lapid on becoming prime minister, the statement said, while lapid passed along his best wishes to the palestinian leader ahead of eid al-adha, the muslim holiday which begins friday. the palestinian news agency wafa also reported the phone conversation, adding that president abbas had expressed his wish that ""peace and stability would prevail in the region as soon as possible."" lapid's predecessor, right-winger naftali bennett, chose not to speak with abbas during his 12-month premiership, while long-time leader benjamin netanyahu oversaw a degradation of israel's relations with the palestinian authority, and it is reported he last spoke to the palestinian leader in 2017. underscoring the current israeli government's changed approach, defense minister benny gantz visited abbas at his ramallah office thursday evening. during the meeting, the palestinian leader ""stressed the importance of creating a political horizon [and] commitment to the signed agreements,"" wafa reported, referring to a series of accords signed between the two sides in the 1990s. a statement from gantz's office said the meeting had discussed ""security and civilian coordination ahead of the visit of us president biden to israel."" as well as israel, biden is also set to visit the west bank next week where he will meet with abbas -- in the first meeting between the palestinian leader and a us president since 2017. the white house hopes the meeting will help draw a line under the significant breakdown in us-palestinian relations seen under the trump administration. in a separate development earlier this week, abbas travelled to algeria where he met with hamas leader ismail haniyeh, also for the first time in several years. the meeting was held on the sidelines of celebrations to mark the 60th anniversary of algeria's independence, algeria's state news agency reported. relations between abbas's fatah party, the largest palestinian faction, and hamas, the islamist group that runs gaza, have been strained for many years. in june 2007, the two groups were in open conflict with each other, in violence that saw the end of palestinian authority control in gaza.",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.9650569558143616,0.028299469500780106,0.00664350064471364,-1.0,0,0,0,0,-1.0,0.07810005387773522,10.0,0.007810005387773522
A leader for all Israelis? Yair Lapid takes over as caretaker prime minister,2022-07-01,79.0,"yair lapid is used to being in the spotlight. the son of a prominent family, lapid has dabbled in acting, screenwriting, music and even amateur boxing, before becoming best known to the israeli public as a journalist-turned-politician. now lapid will be entering his biggest spotlight yet -- as israel's caretaker prime minister. lapid officially took over as caretaker prime minister on friday after the country's parliament, the knesset, passed a bill to dissolve itself a day earlier. he's now preparing for elections, trying to keep former prime minister benjamin netanyahu from climbing back to power. a media celebrity despite his brief acting foray, lapid became a mainstay in israelis' living rooms through the news. after briefly working as a print journalist, he made his way on to television in the mid-1990s, hosting one of the biggest talk shows of the era. but in 2012 lapid changed course following in the footsteps of his journalist-turned politician father. he created a new political party, dubbed ""yesh atid"" (there is a future) and positioned himself as the centrist voice of the middle-class israeli, focusing on domestic issues. he promised to tackle housing costs, end exemptions from the military draft for the ultra-orthodox, and to legalize same-sex marriage. ""what unites all of (our supporters) is that they said yes for hope and yes for mutual responsibility and yes to the fact that the truth is not being held in any side,"" lapid said at the time. a centrist for all in his first campaign, lapid tried to portray his party as one all israelis could be part of, even unveiling his diplomatic platform from a settlement in the occupied west bank. he supports an independent palestinian state, but says east jerusalem shouldn't be its capital. he opposes new settlement construction but says large existing settlement blocs should always be a part of israel. ""yair lapid is the quintessential product of tel aviv, of israel's main secular city, its main business and culture center, center of nightlife and so on,"" anshel pfeffer, a correspondent for haaretz and the economist, told cnn's christiane amanpour. ""many israelis, including israelis who were close to his centrist perhaps leaning leftward politics and views, including many of my colleagues in israeli media, didn't take him seriously. they thought he's a performer, he's a presenter, there's no real substance there, this will be a passing phase."" but lapid's party shocked the israeli political establishment by winning 19 seats in the 2013 elections, second only to netanyahu's likud party. lapid was dubbed israel's new political star, and time magazine named him as one of 2013's ""100 most influential people."" he joined then-prime minister netanyahu's government as finance minister but was fired within less than two years and became one of the opposition's top voices. the most diverse coalition in 2021 after four inconclusive elections in two years, it was lapid who was the architect of the coalition that would ultimately oust netanyahu and end his run as israel's longest-serving prime minister. pulling together parties from across the political spectrum, from the far left to those on the right, and even including the first arab party in to sit in a governing coalition -- the new government held a one-seat majority. but it came at a cost to lapid's own political ambitions. as part of the deal to bring the right-winger naftali bennett on board as prime minister, lapid would only take over after two years. ""lapid brought together this very unwieldy, almost unimaginable, unprecedented coalition of eight parties (and) managed to get them all to vote for naftali bennett as prime minister, managed to maintain them for an entire year, and above all for many israelis he is now the only man in the last 12 years to beat netanyahu -- that by itself is a big achievement,"" pfeffer said. lapid was appointed foreign minister, where he traversed the globe meeting with world leaders and, notably, israel's new arab-state allies. it was lapid who hosted the historic negev summit, where the top diplomatic representatives from the united arab emirates, bahrain, morocco, egypt and the united states met in southern israel for the first time in march 2022. but ultimately it was the coalition's ideological diversity that was also the source of its fragility. it lost its parliamentary majority when two members of bennett's own right-wing party defected. and when some left-leaning members refused to support a recurring bill that among other things, gives israeli settlers in the west bank the same civil rights as citizens in israel, the coalition reached a political impasse. in a shock move, lapid and bennett announced last week they would dissolve their own government and trigger new elections, making lapid interim prime minister. standing together in a show of solidarity, lapid told bennett ""i love you,"" a moment of outward bromance that surprised many in the israeli media. lapid will be the first non-right-wing prime minister of israel in more than a decade. he now has four months to convince the public he should keep the job. elections will be held on november 1. the digest unilever sells ben & jerry's israel business after controversy unilever has sold its ben & jerry's business in israel for an undisclosed amount to american quality products (aqp), which distributes ben & jerry's in the country, following the controversy related to its activities in israel and the west bank. critics took the company to task for doing business in israel -- especially in west bank settlements, considered illegal under international law -- arguing it doesn't align with ben & jerry's liberal image. ben & jerry's will now be sold under its hebrew and arabic names throughout israel and the west bank background: unilever said wednesday that it ""has used the opportunity of the past year to listen to perspectives on this complex and sensitive matter and believes this is the best outcome for ben & jerry's in israel."" the ice cream company, however, tweeted that it doesn't agree with unilever's announcement. ""we continue to believe it is inconsistent with ben & jerry's values for our ice cream to be sold in the occupied palestinian territory,"" it tweeted, adding it will no longer profit from ben & jerry's in israel. why it matters: the sale ends a long saga that had angered ice cream fans on every side of the israel-palestine conflict, but it also highlights the challenges facing consumer brands doing business in the region. egyptian court sentences to death man accused of killing a 21-year-old student a man accused of fatally stabbing a woman last week after she rejected his advances was sentenced to death by a state court in egypt, according to state-run al ahram on tuesday. background: the verdict, issued after two court sessions, will be deferred to egypt's top islamic authority, the grand mufti -- a formality in death penalty cases in the country, al-ahram said. the final verdict will be announced on july 6. the sentence can still be appealed in egypt's court of cassation, as per egyptian law. why it matters: the killing of the woman, naira ashraf, in broad daylight was caught on film and left the arab world in shock as activists called for justice and more protection for women. erdogan says sweden has promised to extradite 73 people as part of nato deal turkish president recep tayyip erdogan said sweden promised to extradite 73 people to turkey as a result of the memorandum that was signed at the nato summit in madrid between sweden, finland and turkey. in signing the agreement, turkey has agreed to support finland and sweden's nato membership bids, removing the last major hurdle to the two countries joining the alliance. ""if the promise is not kept, we will do what is necessary in the agreement,"" erdogan said at a news conference on thursday, adding that turkey would not ratify the agreement. background: turkey previously said it would veto sweden and finland's nato membership bids claiming they harbor members of kurdistan workers party, or pkk, which turkey, the eu and the us recognize as a terror organization. the 10-article memorandum says sweden and finland will address turkey's pending extradition requests of terror suspects in accordance with the european convention on extradition. why it matters: sweden and finland formally ending decades of neutrality and joining nato would be a historic breakthrough for the alliance, and deal a blow to russian president vladimir putin. around the region an ancient tomb dating as far back as 2,400 years to the roman era has been unearthed by archeologists in the gaza strip, showcasing the coastal enclave's rich history. situated on the coast of northern gaza, the tomb is a momentous find for the palestinians living in the territory. the tomb is part of a larger roman cemetery that was discovered by accident earlier this year, said jehad abu hassan, the gaza strip field coordinator for premiere urgence internationale, a french ngo that is involved in helping to preserve gaza's heritage. ""this is the first time a roman cemetery has been found in gaza."" the ngo has also supported work at another archeological site in central gaza called saint hilarion. it's not uncommon for relics to be excavated in this region due to its historical geographic significance, which meant various civilizations moved through the area over the centuries. the tomb is part of an ongoing archeological dig that has been in progress for months, where abu hassan says 40 graves have been found. ""it's great that we protect and keep this rich heritage of gaza for future generations,"" he told cnn. ""when we talk to children about their heritage they are very happy to see that people were coming from everywhere [to gaza]."" the tombs stand out due to the social standing of those people they belonged to, according to a palestinian official in gaza. ""some of the graves were decorated with elegant decorations,"" said mohammed khalla, undersecretary for gaza's ministry of tourism and antiquities, speaking to quds press news agency. ""which indicates they belonged to figures who had a social and administrative status in roman society at the time."" the ministry said it is in the process of securing the necessary funding to preserve the site, according to quds press. interest in protecting the tomb arises from its location near the anthedon (blakhiyah) harbor, gaza's first port and a landmark that played a crucial role in connecting the territory to europe thousands of years ago. by ghazi nasser photo of the day",5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.7467008888721466,0.1994557898491621,0.05384331215173006,-0.8917801697616614,0,0,0,0,-4.458900848808307,-5.37016635111739,10.0,-0.5370166351117389
"Israeli parliament votes to dissolve, triggering fifth election in four years",2022-06-30,80.0,"the israeli parliament, the knesset, voted thursday to dissolve itself, triggering new elections. on friday, foreign minister yair lapid will officially take over as caretaker prime minister under the terms of a coalition agreement made between outgoing prime minister naftali bennett and lapid last year. because lapid -- a former journalist and star tv anchor -- is a caretaker prime minister, there will be no formal swearing-in ceremony. thursday's 92-0 vote finally concludes the slow motion ending to bennett's run as prime minister -- one of the shortest terms in israeli history -- and gives former prime minister benjamin netanyahu a potential path to return to power. as the vote concluded, lapid and bennett wrapped their arms around each other, hugged and switched seats so that lapid was sitting in the prime minister's position. when they were departing the knesset floor, bennett accidentally took lapid's cellphone. ""my brother,"" lapid said, ""you took my phone."" bennett replied, ""my brother, you took my job."" new elections will be held on november 1 -- the fifth round of voting for israelis in less than four years. recent polling shows former ​prime minister netanyahu's likud party on track to win the most number of seats, but the polls do not show that his right-wing bloc will necessarily have enough seats to gain a parliamentary majority and be able to form a ruling government. speaking on the parliament floor before the dissolution vote, netanyahu vowed to return to power. ""we are the only alternative: a strong national government, stable and responsible. a government that will return the national honor to the citizens of israel,"" netanyahu said. the night before the dissolution, bennett announced he would be stepping back from politics and would not run for re-election. ""i will remain a loyal soldier of this country, which i have served all my life as a soldier, officer, minister and prime minister. the state of israel is the love of my life. to serve her is my destiny,"" bennett said in a speech to the nation. ""now is my time to step back a little. look at things from the outside."" the coalition government had been teetering for weeks. but bennett and lapid's announcement ​last week that they wanted to dissolve their own government and hand power to lapid came as a surprise. ""in the last few weeks, we did everything we could to save this government. ​in our eyes, the continuation of its existence was in the national interest,"" bennett said earlier this month, standing alongside lapid. ""believe me, we looked under every rock. we didn't do this for ourselves, but for our beautiful country, for you citizens of israel,"" bennett added. the bennett-lapid government was sworn into office in june last year bringing an end to netanyahu's premiership, which had lasted more than 12 years. made up of no fewer than eight political parties, the coalition stretched right across the political spectrum, including for the first time an arab party, led by mansour abbas. united in a desire to prevent netanyahu -- whose corruption trial had already begun in may 2020 -- from remaining in power, the disparate coalition partners agreed to put their substantial differences to one side. although it notched significant domestic and diplomatic achievements, it was internal politics that ultimately brought the coalition down. recent weeks have seen a number of coalition members either quitting, or threatening to quit, leaving the government without a majority in parliament to pass legislation. the political impasse came to a head earlier this month, when a knesset vote failed to uphold the application of israeli criminal and civil law to israelis in the occupied west bank. among other things, the regulation, which comes up for renewal every five years, gives israeli settlers ​in palestinian territories the same legal treatment as ​they have within israel's borders, and is an article of faith for right-wing members of the coalition, including prime minister bennett. but two members of the coalition ​refused to support the bill, meaning it failed to pass. because parliament dissolved before the law expired on july 1, the regulation will remain in place until a new government is formed​, at which time it will again go up for a vote.",6.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.3328769340490301,0.26385432078192633,0.40326874423772097,0.3115919360293257,0,0,0,0,1.8695516161759542,-4.029391713201704,15.0,-0.26862611421344695

Is there any way out of Israel's neverending election cycle?,2022-06-22,82.0,"it was just over a year ago that a shared desire to oust benjamin netanyahu as the longest-serving israeli prime minister united eight disparate political parties to form the most diverse coalition in israeli history. they succeeded - but it may be short-lived. as the israeli public waits for parliament, the knesset, to be dissolved next week and yair lapid to become caretaker prime minister, benjamin netanyahu and his supporters have been celebrating. a fifth round of elections in less than four years will likely be held sometime in the fall. and despite the fact that netanyahu is in the midst of witness testimonies in an ongoing corruption trial, he could be back in power in a matter of months. cnn spoke to yohanan plesner, a former member of knesset (mk) with the now defunct kadima party, now president of the israel democracy institute, a think tank in jerusalem, about what may happen next. what are the next steps? is prime minister naftali bennett's main coalition partner yair lapid guaranteed to become the next premier? if the bill to dissolve the knesset passes, then lapid will automatically become the prime minister until a new government is formed after elections. if the election is inconclusive, and no one is able to form a new government, lapid's term in office would continue and the country would head back to another election. until the dissolution bill passes, there is still a chance that someone else -- netanyahu, for example -- could instead form an alternative government in the current knesset. when will elections be held? assuming the knesset votes to dissolve itself, it will also set a date for the election. it will have to be after at least ninety days, and within five months. the coalition and the opposition usually reach an agreement on the exact date, with the most likely options being either at the end of october or the beginning of november. what path does netanyahu have to return to power? can he do so without elections? to return to power without an election, netanyahu would need to convince 61 members of the current knesset to vote in support of a government that he would lead. given that the six-seat, mostly arab-supported joint list have said they will not do so, netanyahu's allies would need to convince at least seven additional members of the current coalition to join them. the heads of parties of the current coalition have all stated that they will not do so and would rather head to an election than sit in a netanyahu-led government. what are his chances of winning the most seats in the next election? all the polls are now indicating that netanyahu's likud party will win the most seats in the parliament at around 35 seats in the 120-seat parliament. israel's parliamentary system demands that the governing coalition be supported by at least 61 mks, so winning the most seats does not by itself guarantee that netanyahu will return to the prime minister's office. for that to happen, the likud leader needs other right-wing and religious parties, which would support him in government, to poll strongly. polls indicate that netanyahu's 'bloc' is currently on track to receive around 58 to 60 seats. is there a way out of this endless cycle of elections in israel? on average, israel has held elections every 2.6 years since 1996. this ongoing crisis will not come to an end until israel's leaders put their political differences aside and enact long over-due electoral and constitutional reforms, such as making any attempt to initiate early elections dependent on a two-thirds majority in parliament and amending the current law that demands new elections when a budget fails to pass. what is the root cause of this political deadlock? this perfect storm of political dysfunction is the result of a systematic failure of our electoral system, coupled with the unique situation in which a candidate for prime minister is on trial and therefore members of his own political camp won't sit with him in government. it is likely to continue until one of the sides receives a substantial majority in parliament, or netanyahu decides to take a break from public life until his legal issues are resolved. the digest middle east states pressure biden to come up with strategy to contain iran on a visit to washington earlier this month, saudi deputy defense minister khalid bin salman expressed concerns that the us had still not articulated a comprehensive strategy for dealing with iran's nuclear ambitions, ballistic missile arsenal and support for regional militant groups, sources familiar with the discussions told cnn. background: the us has said that prospects of reaching a nuclear agreement with iran are tenuous, and middle east officials have said that the administration hasn't yet told its allies what ""plan b"" would be should the talks fail. sources said the administration has said that it would keep up the economic pressure on iran and ramp up sanctions enforcement should a deal fall through. the us has also been working to build a regional coalition against iran, urging the gulf countries to integrate all their air and missile defense systems against iranian attacks. why it matters: concerns over potential iranian escalation have fueled a broader diplomatic shift between israel and the gulf countries, leading to normalization agreements with bahrain and the united arab emirates. the precarious security environment has led israel to push heavily for biden to visit saudi arabia and meet with the saudi crown prince, multiple officials said. russian foreign minister lavrov due in iran russian foreign minister sergey lavrov was due to arrive in tehran on wednesday to discuss the iran nuclear deal and the situation in ukraine, the russian foreign ministry said. the trip would be his first under the administration of iranian president ebrahim raisi. background: the visit will be the latest in a series of trips made by russian officials to iran. last month, russian deputy prime minister alexander novak met with iranian petroleum minister javad owji in tehran to discuss swapping supplies for oil and gas, according to russia's tass news agency. why it matters: the meeting comes as russia tries to strengthen ties with traditional allies amid western sanctions on its economy and energy exports. russia and iran, both under western sanctions, sit on some of the world's largest oil reserves. russia is also part of the talks iran is holding with world powers to revive its 2015 nuclear agreement. turkish parliament set to debate media bill decried by journalists protesters demonstrated in istanbul on tuesday against a media bill that turkey's government says will fight ""disinformation,"" but which media rights groups argue will double down on a years-long crackdown on critical reporting. background: the legislation is one of a series of steps during president tayyip erdogan's two decades in power that have driven concerns among rights groups about a muzzling of the minority of media outlets where dissent and critical views are still aired. parliament was expected to begin debating the bill on wednesday. why it matters: a key concern among critics of the bill is an article saying those who spread false information about the country's security and public order to create fear and disturb the public peace will face a prison sentence of one to three years. the bill would also subject digital media to the same regulations as traditional media. around the region for years, tourists arriving in lebanon were used to seeing politically charged tributes to hezbollah leaders, lebanese martyrs and even slain iranian general qasem soleimani upon leaving beirut airport. that's no longer the case. those billboards on the highway out of the country's only airport are now being replaced with images of landmarks and tourist hotspots. the project is the brainchild of minister of tourism walid nassar, who said in an interview with local media that the political banners had not been appreciated by tourists. nassar asked the media teams from hezbollah and its allies in the amal movement, ""with love and respect,"" to give some of the advertising space around the highway to promote lebanon's tourist destinations ""at least for the next four months,"" he said in an interview with al jadeed news this month. hezbollah obliged and the new banners came up late last week. ""i never thought i'd live to see the day when beirut airport could look so lebanese,"" said a twitter user. reeling from an economic collapse, the government has been trying to put the country back on the tourist map. secretary-general of the federation of tourism establishments jean beiruti told the local mtv channel this month that reservations were picking up in mountainous and coastal areas.

Israel set for possible fifth election in four years as PM Bennett moves to dissolve parliament,2022-06-20,83.0,"israel's prime minister naftali bennett has effectively called time on his premiership after just a year in the job. along with his key coalition ally foreign minister yair lapid -- who now looks set to replace him as leader as early as next week -- bennett has agreed to submit a bill to dissolve parliament, which if passed would trigger a general election later this year. the announcement followed weeks of mounting political uncertainty in israel, but still came as a major surprise. a short statement from the prime minister's office said the move came ""after attempts to stabilize the coalition had been exhausted."" a bill would be submitted to parliament at some point next week, the statement added. if it is passed, lapid will become the country's fourteenth prime minister, in line with the original coalition agreement struck last year. it also means israelis will be going to the polls for the fifth time in under four years. among the first items on lapid's agenda, assuming he does become leader, will be preparing for the visit of us president joe biden next month. a senior administration official said the president's trip to the middle east is still expected to go ahead despite the political shakeup in israel. ""we have a strategic relationship with israel that goes beyond any one government. the president looks forward to the visit next month,"" the white house official said. the bennett-lapid government was sworn into office in june last year bringing an end to the premiership of benjamin netanyahu, which had lasted some twelve and a half years. made up of no fewer than eight political parties, the coalition stretched right across the political spectrum, including for the first time an arab party, led by mansour abbas. united in a desire to prevent netanyahu -- whose corruption trial had already begun in may 2020 -- from remaining in power, the disparate coalition partners agreed to put their substantial differences to one side. in november, it notched up a significant domestic achievement, passing a state budget for the first time in nearly four years. but recent weeks have seen a number of coalition members either quitting, or threatening to quit, leaving the government without a majority in parliament to pass legislation. the political impasse came to a head earlier this month, when a knesset vote failed to uphold the application of israeli criminal and civil law to israelis in the occupied west bank. among other things, the regulation, which comes up for renewal every five years, gives israeli settlers the same rights as citizens in israel, and is an article of faith for right-wing members of the coalition, including prime minister bennett. but two members of the coalition failed to support the bill, meaning it failed to pass. if parliament dissolves before july 1st, the regulation will remain in place until a new government is formed. speaking alongside lapid on monday evening, bennett said their government had swept away what he called the bitterness and paralysis of the netanyahu era, instead putting decency and trust back center stage. ""in the last few weeks, we did everything we could to save this government. in our eyes, the continuation of its existence was in the national interest. believe me, we looked under every rock. we didn't do this for ourselves, but for our beautiful country, for you, the citizens of israel."" for his part, lapid paid tribute to bennett as a brave and innovative leader. and he appeared to offer a stark warning of the dangers posed by a return to the leadership of netanyahu. ""what we need to do today is go back to the concept of israeli unity. not to let dark forces tear us apart from within,"" he said. netanyahu, by contrast, was upbeat, saying the country was smiling after what he called an evening of great news. ""after a determined struggle by the opposition in the knesset, and great suffering by the public in israel, it is clear to everyone that the most dismal government in the history of the country has ended."" netanyahu and his supporters have been buoyed by the most recent opinion polls, which show his bloc of right-wing and religious parties performing strongly, though still not strongly enough to secure a majority in parliament.",6.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.46793159780402976,0.18556928168982267,0.34649909877528745,-0.08865036966397773,0,0,0,0,-0.5319022179838664,-1.8707683581805248,30.0,-0.06235894527268416

How a failed vote on Jewish settlers shows the Israeli government is teetering,2022-06-10,85.0,"efforts by former israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and his allies to bring down the country's governing coalition risk hurting the very cause the israeli right has always championed: jewish settlers in the west bank. prime minister naftali bennett's coalition lost a critical vote this week in parliament to renew measures that govern legal rights for the settlers, another major dent in the government's armor, although not yet the fatal blow. the defeat shows the fragility of israel's ruling coalition and how parliamentary gridlock could bring issues of national importance to a complete halt. the right-wing prime minister leads a coalition of unlikely bedfellows from across the political spectrum, including the first arab party to sit in an israeli government. the coalition lost its razor-thin one-seat majority when a member of bennett's own party decamped in april. this week's vote to renew an israeli law covering settlers in the west bank exposed all the fault lines in bennett's coalition of unlikely allies. because the law provides for jewish settlers in the west bank to be treated legally like israelis, most left-wing and arab members of bennett's coalition oppose it in principle -- they are against the settlements. but in order to keep the bennett government in power, most of them voted for the law anyway. and in a twist of politics, right-wing opposition parties including netanyahu's likud voted against it -- despite being ideological supporters of the settlers -- as part of an effort to hurt the coalition regardless of the cost. the opposition's political ploy could have far-reaching consequences beyond weakening bennett. monday's vote was to renew regulations that govern how jewish settlers are treated in the west bank under israeli law. the settlements are considered illegal under international law, which considers the west bank to be occupied territory. israel rejects that, saying the status of the west bank is more complicated than international law allows. despite the controversy about the legal status of the settlements, for decades the regulations have been renewed on a regular basis with little fanfare by left- and right-wing governments. if the bill to renew the regulations isn't passed by the end of june, jewish settlers could find themselves in legal limbo. but some settlers likely support these political maneuvers as a way to bring down the coalition government, even if it complicates their day-to-day lives. the bill can be brought back for a new vote every monday and wednesday until the end of the month. and while there may be short-term legal workarounds should the deadline pass, another scenario is that the government could dissolve before the end of june, which would automatically extend the regulations currently in place until after a new government is formed. but while the government is on shaky ground, its fall isn't inevitable. netanyahu's opposition bloc still doesn't have the 61 votes needed to dissolve the israeli parliament, the knesset, but he's very close, and under some calculations needs to attract just one defector from bennett's coalition. if netanyahu does succeed in dissolving parliament it would trigger new elections, less than two years since the last vote. the digest un nuclear watchdog warns of 'fatal blow' to nuclear deal as iran removes cameras iran is removing essentially all the extra international atomic energy agency (iaea) monitoring equipment that was installed under the 2015 iran nuclear agreement, meaning there are only three to four weeks before it becomes impossible to revive the deal, according to iaea chief rafael grossi. background: iran had warned of retaliation if the iaea's board of governors passed a resolution drafted by the united states, france, britain and germany criticizing tehran for its failure to explain uranium traces found at undeclared sites. the resolution was passed by a majority on wednesday. iran told the agency overnight it planned to remove equipment, including 27 iaea cameras installed under the 2015 deal. why it matters: iran's decisions could further damage prospects for rescuing the nuclear deal. indirect talks on that between iran and the us are already stalled. watch grossi's interview with cnn's becky anderson here. algeria suspends spain treaty, bars imports over western sahara algeria suspended a 20-year-old friendship treaty with spain that committed the two sides to cooperation in controlling migration flows, and also banned imports from spain, escalating a spat over madrid's stance on western sahara. background: algeria was angered when spain said in march it supported a moroccan plan to offer autonomy to western sahara. algeria backs the polisario front movement seeking full independence for the territory, which morocco regards as its own and mostly controls. why it matters: migrant flows have sharply increased across the mediterranean this year as the pandemic and russia's invasion of ukraine has hit the global economy. on wednesday, 113 undocumented migrants arrived in spain using a route that spanish authorities said tended to be used by boats coming from algeria. algeria is also a key gas supplier to spain, but algerian president abdelmadjid tebboune has previously said he would not break the supply contract over the dispute. saudi sponsored golf event begins amid controversy the liv invitational series, a divisive saudi arabian-backed breakaway golf tour, began on thursday as 48 players teed off at the centurion club north of london. the pga tour has suspended all current and future players who have decided to join the new tournament. background: the pga tour and the europe-based dp world tour have declined requests from members for releases to compete at centurion, where finishing last guarantees a check of $120,000. why it matters: the event has been referred to as the richest in golf history. it offers $25 million per event in prize money with $4 million going to this week's individual winner. critics say the series, bank-rolled to the tune of $250 million by saudi arabia's public investment fund (pif) amounts to 'sportswashing' by a nation trying to improve its reputation. what's trending regional: #george_kordahi the man who caused a rupture in saudi-lebanese relations last year has become the subject of a new controversy. social media users from gulf arab states expressed anger at former lebanese information minister george kordahi for comments he made two weeks ago on an iraqi tv station saying oil-rich gulf states provide no help to the levantine state as it suffers a crippling economic crisis. ""the gulf states have not given a single drop of water to lebanon,"" said kordahi. some twitter users shared news reports showing how saudi aid to lebanon dwarfs contributions from its regional rival, iran. one user accused kordahi of fulfilling ""iran's agenda"" in the middle east. the former minister, who first became famous for hosting the arabic version of ""who wants to be a millionaire,"" last october sparked a breakdown in gulf-lebanese relations after openly criticizing the saudi-led coalition's war in yemen. saudi arabia and other gulf countries subsequently withdrew their ambassadors from beirut and kordahi later resigned. saudi arabia and other gulf states returned their ambassadors to beirut this year. 19,100 the number of syrians who became german citizens in 2021. the figure was three times higher than the year before, as many of those who fled between 2014 and 2016 fulfilled eligibility criteria, data from germany's federal statistical office showed. photo of the day",4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.5996398702263832,0.25650239549577236,0.14385775197297335,-0.538061705880536,0,0,0,0,-2.152246823522144,-2.087507057105517,24.0,-0.08697946071272988
Israeli government's fragility laid bare as violence spikes,2022-04-20,86.0,"the 10-month-old israeli coalition government is facing its deepest political crisis to date, after weeks of high-profile attacks across israel, military action in the west bank, and after israeli police entered and arrested hundreds at one of jerusalem's holiest sites. from its inception, the coalition government had a razor thin margin, made up of a historically diverse lineup of political parties from the far left to the right wing, including the first arab party to be an active member of a government coalition. because of that diverse makeup, the government said early on that it had no intention of tackling the most contentious issues in israeli politics. but escalations in recent weeks have placed those issues front and center. its one-seat majority in parliament was lost earlier this month when idit silman, a member of prime minister naftali bennett's own party, defected. the move sent political shockwaves throughout israel but did not necessarily mean the current government would collapse, especially since the opposition, led by former prime minister benjamin netanyahu, doesn't have the numbers for a majority itself. but that could be changing. in recent days, during commemorations of both passover and ramadan, israeli police say they arrested more than 300 people at the al-aqsa mosque compound, where police say people throwing rocks and launching fireworks were jeopardizing safe worship. the palestinian red crescent said scores of people were injured by rubber bullets, stun grenades, and police batons. the presence of israeli police inside the mosque itself became a flashpoint, as it is regarded as offensive to muslims and puts a strain on a decades-old ""status quo"" agreement about the site. in response, the united arab list party, also known by its acronym ra'am, suspended its membership in the coalition to protest what it said was israeli police violence at the holy site that is sacred to both jews and muslims. ""if the government continues its steps against al-quds and its people, al-aqsa, its worshipers and its sanctuaries in this holy month, we will submit a collective resignation, and we call on all parties to cooperate with and support this decision,"" party members said in a statement. for the moment, the action has no immediate consequences -- israel's parliament, the knesset, is in recess for a few more weeks and by the time it returns, the party could decide to sit with the coalition once again. but if even just one member of the ual party defects from the coalition, netanyahu could potentially have the numbers in hand to call for a vote to dissolve parliament and trigger new elections, giving him a pathway back to power. never before in israeli history has the fate of a government been in the hands of an arab, non-jewish party. without ual's support, the coalition would never have taken power. and even before joining the government, party leader mansour abbas had said that while he's a proud member of the government with the aim of improving the lives of the approximately 20% of israel's population that identifies as arab, he has his own ""red lines"" -- though it remains unclear exactly where those lines are. ""i said and i continue to say that the blessed al-aqsa mosque is a red line in which there is no compromise,"" abbas wrote in a facebook post last week. ""this is what i conveyed today in my conversation with the officials with whom i communicated, and i explained to them my position."" apart from abbas' vaunted leverage in the governing coalition, there are other officials whose influence may be moderating the response of israeli police. as well. israeli minister of public security omer bar lev is a member of the left-leaning labor party. and defense minister benny gantz has pushed forward increasing the number of work permits, believing that giving palestinians more economic opportunity will bring more calm. in jerusalem, israeli officials believe they have shown restraint in policing tactics on palestinians around the mosque and old city. israeli media report police have been more reserved in their responses during clashes than in previous incidents and haven't employed the kind of tactics that inflamed tensions during ramadan last year, like barring people from gathering at the damascus gate plaza. israeli officials emphasized that even after the worst of the clashes on friday, more than 50,000 muslim worshippers attended prayers at the compound peacefully, although at various points since then muslim worshippers were blocked from al aqsa as police accompanied jewish groups and foreign tourists on scheduled visits. the compound is often a flashpoint in the israeli-palestinian conflict. it lies in east jerusalem, which most of the international community regards as having been under israeli occupation since 1967. israel disputes that and claims all of jerusalem as its undivided capital, while palestinians want the eastern sector as the capital of their future state. this ramadan, israeli restrictions on movement of palestinians between the occupied west bank and jerusalem have not been as tight as before for those with israeli-issued permits. at the same time though, israel has launched raids across the west bank in response to palestinian attacks, and 14 palestinians have died since late march in clashes with israeli security forces or been shot dead by israeli soldiers for allegedly throwing molotov cocktails or running towards soldiers at a checkpoint. the real test for the israeli government will come in early may, when parliament comes back into session. that is when the true fragility of their position will be made clear.  other top middle east news watchdog claims middle east states, others spied on uk government digital rights watchdog group citizen lab said on monday it had warned british officials that electronic devices connected to government networks, including some inside the prime minister's office and foreign ministry, appeared to be infected with israeli-made spy software. it said the government was targeted by the united arab emirates, cyprus, jordan and india. background: the spy software allegedly used is known as pegasus, a product of israeli cyber arms dealer nso group. an nso spokesperson told reuters the allegations were ""false."" a british government spokesperson refused to comment on security matters, and government spokespeople for the uae, jordan and india didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. cyprus authorities ""categorically"" denied involvement to reuters. why it matters: both jordan and the uae enjoy good relations with the uk and the allegations are likely to embarrass them. uae summons israeli ambassador to protest jerusalem violence the uae foreign ministry summoned the israeli ambassador to protest the treatment of palestinians in jerusalem by israeli forces, the foreign ministry said in a statement on tuesday. background: more than 150 people were injured in clashes with israeli police on friday, according to the palestinian red crescent. the emirati minister of state for international cooperation reem al hashimi told israel's ambassador amir hayek that the uae ""strongly protests"" attacks on ""civilians and incursions into holy places,"" the statement added. why it matters: since spearheading a wave of arab normalization agreements with the jewish state in 2020, this is the first time the uae has summoned israel's envoy. turkey arrests journalist over posts on personal information leak turkish authorities jailed a journalist on tuesday pending trial after he announced hackers had stolen personal information from government websites and shared some of it with him, including president tayyip erdogan's id card, as proof, his lawyer said. background: the independent journalist, ibrahim haskologlu, posted the announcement on twitter, illustrating it with a partially obscured photo of what he said was erdogan's id. his lawyer, emrah karatay, said his client was arrested on a charge of illegally obtaining and disseminating personal information due to his social media posts. why it matters: as well as sharing the purported photo of erdogan's id, haskologlu also published an image of what he said was the id card of hakan fidan, head of turkey's national intelligence agency. most of the information on the cards was concealed. turkey is one of the world's top jailers of journalists and mainstream media is controlled by those close to erdogan's government. around the region this ramadan, drama went beyond the screen with the premiere of television series ""from the pyramid road to..."" about a love triangle that involves a sultry egyptian woman and a kuwaiti couple. the saudi state-owned channel mbc's broadcast of the kuwaiti family drama is raising eyebrows in the kuwaiti government and as far away as egypt. written by kuwaiti writer hiba hamada, the show follows the struggle between abla, a doctor and wife of a wealthy kuwaiti, and an egyptian belly dancer trying to drive a wedge between them for self-interest. kareema, the dancer, is hired to perform at the wedding of abla's son. after the celebrations, she is unable to return home and stays at abla's family home, where she tries to seduce her husband. the show touches on topics deemed controversial in kuwait such as gender roles and relations and has prompted accusations of stereotyping on social media. in one scene, abla is shown lecturing her son about men's

Israel's coalition government loses its majority as right-wing lawmaker quits,2022-04-06,87.0,"israel's government was dealt a major blow on wednesday when coalition chairwoman idit silman resigned, depriving the government of its majority. ""key values in my worldview are inconsistent with current reality,"" she wrote in a letter sent to prime minister naftali bennett. ""i can no longer bear the damage to values that are our essence and right."" she called for a right-wing government to be formed instead. the letter did not make specific reference to government policies, but silman has recently voiced her opposition to plans to liberalize certain prayer rules at the western wall in jerusalem, as well as instructions to allow people to bring chametz -- food that is not kosher for passover -- into hospitals during the upcoming jewish holiday. a spokesperson for the prime minister, from whose yamina party silman hails, declined to comment. by contrast, former prime minister benjamin netanyahu was quick to congratulate silman for her decision. in a tweeted video, he said: ""i call on everyone that was chosen with the votes of the [right-wing and religious] national camp to join idit and return to our home."" it was not immediately clear what happens next. yohanan plesner, president of the israel democracy institute, says the government will only fall if there is majority support for the dissolution of the knesset -- which is in recess until may 8 -- or if there is a majority in parliament in favor of an alternative to the current coalition. ""neither avenue is guaranteed,"" he told cnn, noting that the coalition still holds 60 of the knesset's 120 seats. netanyahu's bloc holds just 54. there is ""zero"" chance, plesner said, that the joint list -- a mainly arab party that holds six seats and is not part of any bloc -- would support netanyahu. ""what we can be sure of is that the coalition and country is turning back to crisis mode,"" he said. ""but how this crisis will pan out is unclear."" the current coalition government was formed on june 13, 2021, after four elections were held in under two years. it comprises eight parties, spanning the spectrum of ideologies -- from the left-wing meretz party, to new hope and yamina on the right. for the first time ever, it also includes an arab party, the united arab list. under the terms of the coalition agreement, the leader of the government's largest party, current foreign minister yair lapid, is due to succeed prime minister naftali bennett in august 2023.",2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.09210880566388369,0.4257127642631531,0.4821784496307373,0.8139349148563177,0,0,0,0,1.6278698297126355,-1.7030714907812359,15.0,-0.11353809938541573
Israel and the West Bank are on edge again. Here are five things you need to know,2022-04-01,88.0,"a series of terror attacks and violent incidents have put israel and the palestinian territories on edge again. in just one week, 11 people were killed in three attacks in israeli towns and cities. it was the deadliest week israel had seen in years and follows weeks of rising tensions that saw israelis targeted in stabbing attacks and several palestinians shot dead by israeli forces in the west bank. the overlap of three major religious holidays over the next month -- ramadan, passover and easter -- could heighten tensions further, exacerbating a potent mix of factors that could spark yet another cycle of violence. here are five things you need to know about the recent uptick in violence. attacks hit deep in israel the lethal attacks took place not in the typical hot spots, disputed areas like jerusalem or the west bank, much of which is considered by the international community to be occupied territory. instead they happened in israeli towns and cities that are not used to such violence. unusually, two of the attacks were carried out by israeli-arabs. on march 22, an israeli-arab killed four israeli civilians in a stabbing and ramming attack in the southern city of be'er sheva, israeli police said. the attacker had previously been imprisoned for supporting isis. on sunday, two israeli-arab men killed two border police officers and wounded six passersby in the northern city of hadera, local media reported. the two were also affiliated with isis, which claimed responsibility for the incident -- the first such isis claim for an attack in israel since 2017. then on tuesday night, a palestinian from the west bank shot and killed five people in bnei brak, a mostly orthodox city just east of tel aviv. two of those killed were ukrainian citizens, two were israeli civilians and one was a police officer who responded to the scene, according to israeli police. in all three cases the attackers were shot and killed by either civilians or security forces. tensions rising in the west bank and jerusalem tensions had already been on the rise for weeks, even before the three attacks. there had been several stabbings carried out by palestinians against israelis in jerusalem in march and several palestinians, including teenagers, had been shot dead by israeli forces in the west bank during clashes over the past several weeks. the security situation is escalating. while many of the recent attacks targeted police or military forces within jerusalem's old city, the most recent stabbing targeted an israeli out for a jog in a popular neighborhood outside the old city. two of the three attacks in the past week targeted civilians. the cycle of violence has continued since then. on thursday, two palestinians -- including one teenager -- were killed and 15 others wounded during an israeli police raid in the west bank city of jenin targeting suspects connected to the bnei brak shooting. the family home of the attacker has also been scheduled for demolition, israeli prime minister naftali bennett said, a standard practice by israeli forces to ""create deterrence"" (the israeli army says families can try to appeal demolitions). a few hours later, an israeli was stabbed on a bus in the west bank just south of bethlehem. the attacker, a palestinian, was shot dead by an armed civilian on the bus, the israeli military said. and for months, palestinian and israeli activists have warned that violence against palestinians carried out by israeli setters is at an all-time high. israel's defense minister benny gantz has vowed to treat settler violence with a ""heavy hand,"" calling perpetrators ""terrorists"" and promising special military teams that are supposed to help monitor areas where clashes tend to erupt -- although most palestinians are already wary of the israeli military, saying they believe they only help protect settlers. pm calls on civilians to carry firearms as israel goes on high alert israel's security alert status has been raised to its highest level. that means police are much more visible on the streets, working longer shifts and focusing their presence on schools and popular gathering spots. troop presence in the west bank hand around the gaza strip has also increased, with the israel defense forces (idf) announcing they are adding 14 battalions and combat soldiers from special forces units. soldiers who carry a certain class of weapon will also be required to take their weapons with them even while on leave, bennett said. bennett has also made the unusual call to all civilians with a license to carry a firearm to now keep their guns on them at all times, saying israelis need to be ""alert."" ""open your eyes. whoever has a license to carry a weapon, this is the time to carry it,"" he said in a video statement wednesday. palestinian militant groups mobilize palestinian militant groups have praised the attacks and called for further action, especially in reaction to raids in the west bank and violence from jewish settlers. hamas, the militant group that controls gaza, said in a statement: ""the continuous crimes of the occupation portend a comprehensive explosion, which will be more powerful and more painful, in which our people will be involved in all parts of our occupied land."" abu hamza, the military spokesman for the al-quds brigades of palestinian islamic jihad, announced ""the raising of full readiness among our fighters in all military formations."" bennett's government faces a tough test the violence could threaten bennett's razor thin margin in parliament. the current governing coalition is made up of right, left and center parties including, for the first time ever, an arab party. opposition leader (and former prime minister) benjamin netanyahu and his supporters have been placing the blame for the wave of violence on the coalition government. former security officials have called the attacks intelligence failures, especially since some of the attackers in the past week had previously been in prison for terrorist-related support or activity. as top israeli journalist barak ravid wrote in axios this week, ""for years, personal security was one of the main issues israelis voted on. a feeling of insecurity among the public could erode the very narrow base of support the government has.""",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.4939096527440207,0.17375066166832334,0.022815901786088943,-0.690449267447875,0,0,0,0,-0.690449267447875,-1.8616185402452443,10.0,-0.18616185402452443
Israel's police under fire amid further allegations of 'Pegasus' cybersurveillance use against public figures,2022-02-07,89.0,"israel's government is set to consider opening a commission of inquiry into the police amid growing anger over the alleged police use of pegasus hacking software against a wide array of senior public figures. the development comes after a new report by the business news website calcalist alleging that phones belonging to, among others, several heads of government ministries, a leading businessman, a co-defendant in the trial of benjamin netanyahu, and even one of the former prime minister's sons, were infiltrated with pegasus spyware. it is the latest report by the website, which is linked to israel's leading yedioth ahronoth newspaper, detailing alleged police use of the nso group-made pegasus software. like its previous reporting on the story, the website did not provide any information about its sources, nor did it provide any dates when the alleged illegality took place. earlier calcalist reports have focused on the alleged failure to seek authorization for the use of pegasus but the latest allegations go much further by suggesting widespread surveillance of people under no suspicion of any wrong doing. ""calcalist can reveal for the first time a list of dozens of citizens who were targeted by israel police, having their phones hacked by nso spyware and their personal information swiped and filed away. the surveillance was conducted to phish for intelligence even before any investigation had been opened against the targets, and without judicial warrants,"" the article began. within hours of the report's publication, israel's public security minister, who has overall responsibility for the police, announced he was asking cabinet colleagues to approve the establishment of a government commission of inquiry into the use of spyware and other electronic snooping technologies, ""to investigate in depth the violation of civil rights and their privacy in the years in question."" prime minister naftali bennett also commented, saying, ""the reports about pegasus, if they are true, are very serious. this tool and similar tools, are important tools in the fight against terrorism and severe crime, but they were not intended to be used in phishing campaigns targeting the israeli public or officials -- which is why we need to understand exactly what happened."" the allegations pile further pressure on israel's police forces, which have been under fire since the first calcalist report last month alleging use of pegasus. last week, in a vaguely-worded statement, police admitted that what they called ""additional findings"" from an internal investigation had been passed on to the attorney general's office, which opened its own investigation into how israeli police monitors electronic communications. speaking on israeli radio monday morning, police spokesman eli levy insisted that all police actions investigated thus far had been carried out legally. ""up to this point, there has been no known wrong-doing in the work of the police. we are transparent and open to any investigation,"" he said. ""if it is found that a police officer or an official wearing a uniform has committed a criminal offense, he will be prosecuted instantly."" among those whose phones were allegedly infected with pegasus is iris elovitch, a co-defendant in the corruption trial of former prime minister netanyahu. lawyer jack chen, who is representing elovitch's husband, shaul, who is also on trial, said the revelations meant the trial should be suspended. one of netanyahu's senior likud party colleagues, yisrael katz, echoed that sentiment on twitter. ""in light of what has been exposed in the past few days, and this morning, i demand an immediate freeze of all of the legal proceedings against binyamin netanyahu ... a gross attempt was made here to topple an incumbent prime minister through illegal means and there is a grave threat to democracy in the state of israel,"" katz tweeted. proceedings in the trial, being held at jerusalem's district court, continued monday as planned, though prosecutors were given until 7:00 p.m. to say whether the current witness, dana neufeld, a legal advisor at the communications ministry during the period in question, was among those under surveillance.

Israeli officials deny report that police are using cellphone spying software on citizens without court approval,2022-01-20,90.0,"israeli officials are denying parts of a report that says they used nso hacking software pegasus to spy on civilians -- including leaders of protest movements -- without the required legal permissions. in an article published on tuesday, business website calcalist alleged that the nso group's pegasus spyware was used by israeli police to spy on civilians -- including politicians and leaders of protest movements -- without the required legal permissions. the website did not cite any sources or documents, though the report elicited wide reaction from the government and lawmakers. israel's minister of public security omer bar-lev denied that surveillance was done without permission on tuesday, writing in a tweet, ""once investigated, there is no practice of wiretapping, or intrusion into devices, by the israel police without the approval of a judge."" bar-lev added that he will further investigate and make sure no one is ""cutting corners"" with regard to the use of nso group's software. calcalist, which is part of the same media organization as israel's leading yedioth ahronoth newspaper, reported on tuesday israeli police have used the pegasus technology in the past to remotely hack into the phones of ""mayors, leaders of political protests against former prime minister benjamin netanyahu, former governmental employees, and a person close to a senior politician,"" without the proper court approval. the report did not specifically name any of the alleged targets of the hacking. according to security researchers, pegasus is capable of remotely infecting mobile phones and eavesdropping on calls or text messages. such use of technology on israeli citizens can only be done under court supervision. the calcalist report says that in the instances it chronicled the surveillance was ordered by ""high-ranking police officers without a court warrant or the supervision of a judge."" in a lengthy statement on thursday, israeli police commissioner yaakov shabtai said that after they first became aware of the calcalist report, the police began ""a thorough internal investigation"" that ""did not yield any findings that indicate an alleged deviation from the provisions of the law."" shabtai said authorities would ask the newspaper to provide them with more concrete details on the alleged incidents. he added that police would step up review of the allegations, saying he has ""instructed all relevant parties to continue to deepen the examinations, beyond the examinations that have already been done, of all the actions, also with regard to past years."" ""i assure all citizens of israel that the police will continue to fulfill its complex and important tasks, and that it will not spare any legal, and only legal, means to thwart a serious crime in the state of israel,"" shabtai said. an nso spokesperson said in a statement that ""we cannot confirm or deny any existing or potential customers. we wish to clarify that the company does not operate the system once (it has been) sold to its governmental customers and it is not involved in any way in the system's operation."" the spokesperson added that nso licenses its technology to ""prevent terror and crime"" and that its employees are ""not exposed to customers' targets nor are they privy to the collected data, the ongoing operations or any other investigations by its customers."" israeli lawmakers from across the political spectrum condemned the report and called for investigations. minister of energy karine elharrar, a member of the center-left yesh atid party, told israeli army radio that the allegations in the report are ""something that a democratic country cannot allow."" member of parliament moshe arbel from the ultra-orthodox shas party told army radio ""there is no coalition and opposition. if even half of this report is true, it's a national tragedy."" on thursday morning, minister of the environmental protection tamar zandberg of the left wing meretz party, told the 103fm radio station she wants a state-level commission into the allegations. cybersecurity researchers have documented years of alleged abuse of nso group's spyware by governments. the spyware has allegedly been found on the phones of journalists and human rights workers from mexico to morocco. the sale of such technology to foreign countries must be approved by israel's ministry of defense. in july, after more reports of the pegasus software being used by governments to spy on journalist, business executives and human rights activists, israeli defense minister benny gantz said they took the claims seriously and appointed an interministerial team to look into the current process and whether israeli-made technology was being misused abroad. apple and facebook have sued nso group for allegedly violating a us anti-hacking law, allegations that the nso group denies. in november, the us commerce department blacklisted the nso group and another spyware firm, candiru, accusing the companies of providing spyware to foreign governments that ""used these tools to maliciously target"" journalists, embassy workers and activists.",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.6967331128461021,0.07972598448395729,0.00925523741170764,-0.785714285714284,0,0,0,0,-0.785714285714284,-2.802044283389776,10.0,-0.28020442833897763
"Netanyahu negotiating possible corruption case plea deal to safeguard political career, sources say",2022-01-18,91.0,"for years, former israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu has called his ongoing corruption trial a ""witch hunt"" and an ""attempted coup."" although his denunciations of the case echoed words often heard from his once-close ally donald trump, netanyahu is now deviating from the former us president's methods. netanyahu and his team have been discussing a possible plea deal with prosecutors in his corruption case, two sources close to the matter tell cnn. the negotiations, if fruitful, could be finalized in the next few weeks, according to the sources, and would bring a surprising end to a years-long drama. depending on the details of any eventual plea deal sentence, netanyahu could be giving up politics for the next seven years. here's what you need to know. the charges netanyahu faces charges in three separate cases. in case 1000, he is charged with fraud and breach of trust in connection with allegations that he received gifts like cigars and champagne from overseas businessmen. in case 2000, he is also charged with fraud and breach of trust and is accused of seeking favorable coverage in one of israel's top newspapers in exchange for limiting the circulation of one of the paper's main rivals. in the most serious case, case 4000, he is charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust for allegedly advancing regulatory benefits worth the equivalent of more than $250 million at the time to his friend shaul elovitch, who was the controlling shareholder for the telecommunications company bezeq. in return, the prosecution says, elovitch ensured positive coverage of the prime minister in an online news site he owned called walla! news. elovitch has denied the charges. the trial began in may of 2020 at the jerusalem district court and is in the midst of hearing from witnesses for the prosecution. moral turpitude the possible plea deal would likely see the most serious charge of bribery dropped altogether, another charge of fraud and breach of trust watered down (in case 1000), and one of the three cases completely shelved (case 2000), according to information provided by the sources who are close to the negotiations. but the sources say that a key point of disagreement is over the length of community service netanyahu would receive for pleading guilty to the remaining charges, and whether that sentence carries with it the stain of moral turpitude. if the sentence is longer than three months, then prosecutors can insist on the inclusion of moral turpitude, which would bar the 72-year-old netanyahu from politics for seven years according to israeli law. even if prosecutors choose not to include the moral turpitude label, a future election commission judge could still decide netanyahu's convictions and sentence barred him from politics for the same seven-year period. it is different if the sentence is shorter than three months. in this situation there is a loophole according to israeli law. if netanyahu faces his sentence as a private citizen, which he could ensure by resigning his seat in parliament, the issue of moral turpitude would not be considered. why now? word of the possible plea deal comes just weeks before attorney general avichai mandelblit is set to end his term on january 31. mandelblit was responsible for issuing the indictments against netanyahu, following lengthy police investigations, and is largely seen as wanting to end his time in office with a successful conviction. the next attorney general will be appointed by the new government, led by prime minister naftali bennett, and may be much less likely to offer such a plea deal to netanyahu. but critics -- including hundreds of protesters who gathered outside of mandelblit's home on saturday night -- are pushing back against the deal. for them, anything less than a full a trial and sentence carrying with it the label of moral turpitude would be regarded as a failure, given the seriousness of pursuing cases against a serving prime minister. political reverberations while at first glance it may seem like netanyahu's political opponents would be happy to see him take a plea deal in disgrace and leave the political arena, some israeli analysts say such a move could shake the stability of the current government. the new government, lead by former netanyahu chief of staff bennett, is a hodgepodge of political parties ranging from far-right parties like bennett's, to the left. it also includes the first arab party to sit in government in israel. the glue that has bound those parties reflects a shared wish to end netanyahu's time as israel's longest serving prime minister. and for as long as he has remained in front line politics -- as the leader of the opposition -- it has held together well. but if he were to exit the stage, it could provide an opening for a new coalition, made-up entirely of right-wing and religious parties, that could topple the current unity government.

"Israel announces plan to double Golan Heights population, drawing condemnation from Syria",2021-12-28,92.0,"israel said on sunday that it intends to double the population of the contested area of the golan heights in the coming years, drawing the ire of the syrian government. israeli prime minister naftali bennett made the announcement at a special cabinet meeting held in the golan heights on sunday. he said they will invest 1 billion shekels (about $320 million) to make the area a ""place that is good to live in,"" including building thousands of new homes and establishing two new settlements, according to a translation of his comments posted to the official facebook page of the israeli prime minister. ""i would like to be clear: after many static years regarding the scope of community life, our goal today is to double the population of the golan heights,"" bennett said. ""to this end, we will establish two new communities on the golan heights, asif and matar. we are increasing community life here,"" he added. the golan heights are considered occupied territory under international law and un security council resolutions. israel seized the narrow strip of land from syria in 1967 during the six-day war and annexed the land in 1981. there are approximately 53,000 people living in the golan heights, split almost evenly between israeli settlers and syrian druze, as well as a small population of alawites. in march 2019, then-us president donald trump overturned longstanding us policy regarding the israeli-occupied golan heights, announcing ""it is time"" for the united states to ""fully recognize israel's sovereignty"" over the region. afterwards, then-prime minister benjamin netanyahu and his government established the new settlement of trump heights, but the plans amounted to little more than a sign for tourists. on sunday, bennett said that of the 1 billion shekels (nis) to be invested in the area, ""nis 500 million is for planning and housing. nis 162 million is for regional development -- tourism, industry, commerce, everything that creates good jobs here. another nis 160 million will be for improving the quality of life -- transportation, medical care and other aspects of life."" the cabinet unanimously approved the plan, israeli media reported. after the meeting, ahmad tibi, senior member of the opposition arab joint list, said ""it doesn't matter how many cabinet meetings are held on the golan, it is occupied syrian territory. all parts of the coalition are responsible for the decisions made during this cabinet meeting, as well as for the deepening of the settlements and the violence of settlers,"" according to ai monitor. the syrian government on monday vociferously condemned israel's announcement, according to syria's state-run news agency, sana.

Trump uses anti-Semitic tropes to again criticize Jewish Americans,2021-12-17,93.0,"former president donald trump, in a newly released interview, claimed that jewish americans ""either don't like israel or don't care about israel,"" while also suggesting that evangelical christians ""love israel more than the jews in this country."" trump's comments are the latest in a series of controversial remarks he has been known to make about jewish americans. during his first campaign for president, trump delivered a speech to the republican jewish coalition that was rife with anti-semitic stereotypes. more recently, he told conservative radio host ari hoffman that ""israel literally owned congress...10 years ago, 15 years ago... and today it's almost the opposite."" speaking to israeli journalist barak ravid, during a sit-down interview earlier this year, parts of which aired friday on the podcast ""unholy: two jews on the news,"" the former president said, ""it's a very dangerous thing that's happening,"" as he claimed that jewish americans have turned their back on israel. ""there's people in this country that are jewish and no longer love israel,"" trump said. ""i'll tell you, the evangelical christians love israel more than the jews in this country."" trump outperformed both of his democratic rivals -- hillary clinton and joe biden -- with white evangelical voters in 2016 and 2020 and is currently considering a third run for president in 2024. speaking to ravid, trump blamed biden and former president barack obama for what he perceives as israel's waning influence over us elected officials. ""it used to be that israel had absolute power over congress, and today i think it's the exact opposite. and i think obama and biden did that,"" trump charged. ""and yet in the election, they still get a lot of votes from the jewish people. which tells you that the jewish people, and i've said this for a long time, the jewish people in the united states either don't like israel or don't care about israel."" in the same interview, trump suggested that the new york times ""hates israel"" even though ""they're jewish people that run the new york times.""

""there was no one who did more for netanyahu than me. there was no one who did for israel more than i did. and the first person to run to greet joe biden was netanyahu. and not only did he congratulate him -- he did it in a video. if you look at the leaders of other countries -- like brazil -- he waited months. putin. many other leaders. mexico. all of them also felt that the election was over. but they, too, were waiting. no one did more than me for bibi. money too. we gave them a lot of money and gave them soldiers. we did everything."" netanyahu did post his congratulations on twitter and in a video on november 8, 2020, the day after the race had been called in biden's favor. netanyahu said in that post he and biden have had a ""long & warm"" personal relationship for almost 40 years and sees him as ""a great friend of israel"" and looks forward to working together. in a separate twitter post, netanyahu thanked trump ""for the friendship you have shown the state of israel and me personally, for recognizing jerusalem and the golan, for standing up to iran, for the historic peace accords and for bringing the american-israeli alliance to unprecedented heights."" despite posting his congratulations online, netanyahu was slow to call biden after the election, waiting two weeks to call the president-elect, which drew criticism from some in israel. ravid spoke to the former president twice in 2021 as part of research into a new book about the abraham accords, which will be published sunday. the quotes from the interview appear in friday's addition of israel's best-selling daily yedioth ahronoth, as well as the us-based news website axios. this story has been updated to correct that benjamin netanyahu congratulated joe biden in a video message.",8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.2729467385215685,0.3989230515435338,0.32813019238528796,0.28315470863774544,0,0,0,0,2.2652376691019636,-9.743060711915348,27.0,-0.36085410044130917
A single sentence that perfectly captures the utter madness of the Trump era,2021-12-10,95.0,"in an interview with donald trump earlier this week, conservative talk radio host hugh hewitt said something truly breathtaking. ""you know, mr. president, you and i disagree about the election, but we agree on so much,"" hewitt told trump, segueing into a conversation about china's hypersonic missiles. talk about an other-than-that-how-was-the-play-mrs. lincoln moment! that hewitt uttered that line without irony is a telling window into how conservatives have found ways to rationalize trump and his fundamentally anti-democratic attempts to undermine the faith of the american public in the 2020 election results. here's the reality: you can't just sort of yada yada the election rejection embraced by trump. because in refusing to accept the result of the 2020 election and repeatedly (and falsely) alleging voter fraud, trump is actively working against everything that makes america, well, america. hewitt's attempt to dismiss his disagreement with trump over the election then as just another policy disagreement is laughable. this isn't hewitt saying we should have stayed in afghanistan and trump saying we should have pulled american troops out. this is the former president of the united states refusing to accept the results of a national election. and, it's actually more than that. it's that trump has turned election denialism into a litmus test for aspiring republican candidates. if you aren't willing to say you believe -- contra all available evidence -- that the 2020 election was stolen, then you not only won't have trump's support but may well find him actively working to defeat you when you run for reelection. (see brian kemp and david perdue in georgia. also benjamin netanyahu in israel.) trump is working to make a belief that the 2020 election was stolen a central piece of the republican party platform. and, again, this isn't like making abortion or trade a party platform. this is making a rejection of american democracy a major part of what it means to be a republican. because of all of that, hewitt can't simply write what trump is doing as a place where they disagree. that sort of justification is how we got into this mess, with one of the two major political parties in the country devolving more into a cult of personality than any sort of organization gathered together by a shared set of principles and policies. refusing to believe in the results of a free and fair election have to be disqualifying for any party leader. it's non-negotiable. if we can't agree that the election was fair -- even if our preferred candidate lost -- then we have sacrificed the thing that makes america great. that hewitt -- and his fellow conservatives who continue to bend over backward to placate trump -- can't (or won't) see that suggests just how lost the conservative movement is at the moment.",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0247935198004479,0.8098514766796775,0.013181139431569887,-0.024307125952252547,0,0,0,0,-0.024307125952252547,-8.981653552153315,27.0,-0.3326538352649376
Don't count on an end to the Joe Biden-Naftali Bennett honeymoon -- yet,2021-11-08,96.0,"is the joe biden-naftali bennett honeymoon over? it would seem so. everywhere one looks these days there appears to be disagreement and division between washington and jerusalem. noisy tensions appear to be brewing over any number of issues including settlements, the currently closed jerusalem consulate and israel designating six human rights organizations as terror groups. but look closer, and a more complex dynamic is visible. the bennett government -- at least its right-wing elements -- seems persuaded that biden is too busy; too worried about right-wing former prime minister benjamin netanyahu's potential return, should the bennett-led coalition collapse; and too fearful of domestic fallout, which always hangs over a us president feuding with israel, to really get tough with israel on any of these matters. and there's a very good chance the israelis are reading biden's priorities correctly. indeed, the one issue on which they don't appear to be spatting -- at least publicly -- is iran. for biden, the palestinian issue isn't ready for prime time, and the iran nuclear issue could be headed for prime trouble. maintaining close ties with israel, even if it means sacrificing america's already shredded credibility on the palestinian issue, is good politics and smart policy. few might have predicted in june, when the bennett government was first sworn in, that there would be a spate of issues piling up that could sow discord between the two allies. sure, bennett took office as a right-wing prime minister who could easily have fit in a likud government. but the current coalition had left and centrist elements too, to keep him in check. despite his politics, bennett carried less us-related baggage than netanyahu, who had alienated democrats with overtures to republicans. and besides, all in bennett's coalition have had a common interest in avoiding contentious issues like the palestinian problem that, were they to rise to the forefront and spark division among israel's fragile ruling order, might cause the government to collapse and bring netanyahu back into power. evidently, that was biden's calculation, too. the us president called bennett to congratulate him within hours of the new israeli government's swearing-in. indeed, bennett was the only world leader to visit washington during biden's afghan withdrawal crisis in august. if anything, it seemed the two leaders had agreed to a close bond with one another. biden referred to an ""unshakable partnership"" during their white house meeting. biden seems to have banked on bennett being constrained from taking steps that might embarrass him; too worried about his own government's potential collapse; and too smart and too weak, in his domestic-political standing, to push the us into a corner. and bennett seemed to believe biden was too focused on his own domestic concerns to bother much with the palestinian issue, let alone pick a fight with israel. over the past few months, however, the israelis have pushed the envelope -- and seem to have forgotten their side of the bargain. seemingly under pressure from his own base and from his right-wing partners, bennett and his government have taken several actions that have drawn hard looks and responses from the biden administration. first, a large number of settlement housing units has been approved -- the first by the new israeli government -- many deep in the west bank. that drew a harsh response from the biden administration. indeed, the projects were approved despite a warning from us secretary of state antony blinken to minister of defense benny gantz. at the same time, israel appears to be advancing plans for construction of other long-planned housing projects -- givat hamatos and e-1 -- that if completed would virtually divide jerusalem from the west bank and further bury already distant hopes for a two-state solution. second, a battle appears to be looming over the reopening of the us consulate in east jerusalem, through which washington formerly liaised directly with the palestinians, and which biden pledged to reopen after trump had closed it in 2019. originally seen by the us administration as a low-cost way of restoring the pre-trump status quo and strengthening ties with the palestinians, the issue has become hot and volatile, as the israeli right wing views it as a trojan horse designed to divide jerusalem. others worry it could trigger the collapse of bennett's government. not surprisingly, republicans in congress have jumped on the issue with legislation designed to prevent the biden administration from acting and by painting biden as appeasing the palestinians and dividing jerusalem. the bennett government isn't sleepwalking into a potential crisis. it seems to have made a judgment that the biden administration has no stomach for a fight. that may well be a safe bet. on settlements, the us administration has confined its reaction to tough words, but no action. on the consulate, the administration had already promised to delay reopening it until after the israeli budget passes; the latest thinking conveyed to israeli foreign minister lapid by secretary of state blinken was to appoint a small working group to work out a solution -- a sure sign that what's in store is more delay. not pushing harder on settlements and the consulate will undermine the administration's credibility and will disappoint those who expected biden to reverse his predecessor's policies, particularly toward the palestinians. but governing is about choosing. and in the greater scheme of things, the biden administration has all but written off the palestinian issue as a low priority -- not ready for prime time and not worth the investment of badly needed political capital, especially when the administration is struggling at home. the trouncing democrats took this past tuesday -- when republicans swept statewide elections in virginia and showed better than expected in new jersey's governor race -- has only deepened the importance of husbanding limited political capital and reducing the biden administration's exposure. indeed, the last thing biden wants or needs now is a fight with israelis, republicans and maybe even a few democrats over jerusalem. instead, with the nuclear negotiations with iran set to resume on november 29, biden should keep his powder dry in the event those negotiations make progress and he encounters real pushback from israel and those in congress who oppose returning to the old nuclear deal without correcting its deficiencies.",3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.9483406941095988,0.03156320719669262,0.020096138274918,-1.0,0,0,0,0,-3.0,0.1128231113128062,16.0,0.007051444457050388
"Israel doubles down against US, saying there is no room in Jerusalem for an American Consulate for Palestinians",2021-11-07,97.0,"sitting next to the israeli foreign minister in washington this october, secretary of state antony blinken was clear: the americans want to re-open their consulate in jerusalem to serve palestinians. ""we'll be moving forward with the process of opening a consulate as part of deepening of those ties with the palestinians,"" blinken said at the state department. less than a month later, israel's political leadership was also clear: it has no plans to approve such a consulate (the host country must approve any new foreign consulate). asked by cnn at a press conference saturday evening about us intentions, prime minister naftali bennett said his government had presented its opinion to the americans ""clearly and openly."" ""there is no room for another american consulate in jerusalem. we always present our position quietly without drama and we expect it to be understood. jerusalem is the capital of one state and that's the state of israel,"" bennett said, standing alongside foreign minister yair lapid and finance minister avigdor liberman. ""i'm sure our american friends and us will continue to collaborate on a long list of big things."" lapid, who sat next to blinken as he made those comments in washington last month, echoed bennett's sentiments, adding that if the americans want to open a consulate for palestinians in ramallah, they would be welcome to do so. ""as for the (us) consulate, as we both said it is not about politics and political stability. it is the state of israel refusing in principle that a consulate be opened in jerusalem,"" lapid said. former president donald trump folded the consulate in 2019, merging it into the new american embassy in jerusalem after moving it from tel aviv when the united states recognized jerusalem as israel's capital. for many palestinians, an american consulate in jerusalem is a precursor to what they hope will one day be an american embassy in east jerusalem, capital of a potential future state of palestine. the americans have been seen as largely holding off from major confrontations with israel over issues like the consulate or the expansion of jewish settlements in the west bank, as a way to help shore up the stability of the coalition government. stitched together from a diverse group of eight parties representing a broad spectrum of ideologies, the government came to power in june agreeing on few subjects except a desire to oust former prime minister benjamin netanyahu after 12 years in power. passing a new state budget at the end of last week -- which had not been accomplished since 2018 leading to israel's record four elections in two years -- puts the government on much more stable ground (because failure to do so by november 14 would have triggered new elections). now some world partners, including european diplomats like irish foreign minister simon coveney, have made it clear that with the new government now looking more secure, it is time to start pushing israel harder on issues related to the palestinians. ""i think that both the eu and the us quite frankly have been cautious in terms of any criticism of this new israeli government because it is a fragile government,"" coveney told cnn's becky anderson on thursday. but with the budget passed, and israel's government looking set, ""both washington as well as the european union needs to now focus on their relationship with this new israeli government, and make it very clear to them that if we are serious about delivering a peace process together, well, then expanding settlements not only is illegal, but it is also unacceptable to the international community,"" he added. hussein al sheikh, the palestinian authority's head of civil affairs, said in a tweet on sunday that bennett's statements about the consulate in jerusalem represent a ""challenge from the israeli government to the #biden administration,"" seeing as it had ""already announced repeatedly its decision to open the us consulate in east jerusalem!!!"" while the new israeli government's mantra in its relations with the united states has been ""no drama,"" especially when it comes to a possible return to the iran nuclear deal, the biden administration has openly criticized the israeli government recently over issues related to the palestinians. a recent announcement by israel to green light thousands of new israeli housing units in the west bank, was criticized by the state department, whose spokesperson ned price called it ""completely inconsistent with efforts to lower tensions and to ensure calm."" israel's move to label six palestinian ngos as terrorist organizations, accusing them of working with the designated terrorist group popular front for the liberation of palestine, also drew some sharp words from the europeans and americans. ""we believe respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms, and a strong civil society are critically important for responsible and responsive governance,"" state department spokesperson ned price said at the time. but when asked on saturday if his government was headed toward a confrontation and increased tensions with the americans, now that the budget had passed, bennett simply said, ""no."" ""there is so much more we agree upon with american friends that we disagree upon,"" the prime minister said, adding "" i am sure our american friends and us will continue to collaborate on a long list of big things.""

Trump's inner circle takes a trip down memory lane in Jerusalem,2021-10-12,98.0,"for a few short hours in jerusalem this week, the trump band got back together for a glitzy reunion gig. ""there goes the royal family,"" one attendee quipped as ivanka trump and jared kushner were inundated with hellos and selfie requests. at the brand-new museum of tolerance, highlights from the signing of the abraham accords played as the former president's daughter and son-in-law, former treasury secretary steve mnuchin, former secretary of state mike pompeo and other trump administration alumni mingled with the rich and powerful over ceviche, steaks, and plenty of drinks. huge, black-fringed table lamps towered over the curious selection of guests -- including nfl star peyton manning and fifa president gianni infantino -- at one of several open bars. the whole event had an ""alice in wonderland"" feel, as if those present had tumbled through the looking glass and into an alternate reality where donald trump was still president of the united states and benjamin netanyahu was still prime minister of israel. in theory, this was a launch party for the friedman center for peace through strength, an organization founded by the former us ambassador to israel, david friedman, which seeks to advance the abraham accords -- the september 2020 deal, brokered by the us, to normalize relations between israel and the united arab emirates, bahrain, sudan and morocco. in practice, it felt like a trump reunion, and a campaign event for pompeo, who received an award recognizing his work on the abraham accords, while assiduously avoiding reporters. many attendees wished out loud that pompeo would run for us president in 2024 -- something he is reportedly considering, if trump doesn't run again. ""we need to order the pompeo wine!"" said a diplomat's wife at the bar, on learning that some of the drinks on offer were from the psagot winery, located in an israeli settlement in the west bank that named one of its reds after pompeo last year. others were even more explicit. ""time ran out on the trump administration, and we saw some of your achievements backslide, but hopefully president pompeo will continue that path,"" billionaire philanthropist sylvan adams, a co-chair of the event, said -- to huge applause -- before adding that he thought pompeo and the abraham accords architects would have been a ""much more deserving"" winner of this year's nobel peace prize. the us and israel's current leaders, president joe biden and prime minister naftali bennett, may as well not have existed. just one serving member of the israeli cabinet -- interior minister ayelet shaked -- appeared to be in attendance. in a brief interview with cnn at the event, friedman said he had stayed in close touch with the trump administration alumni who flew out for the event and that it hadn't been difficult to get them to make the long journey to israel. kushner and trump arrived at 4am on monday and left the same evening. ""i love all these people: jared, ivanka, mnuchin, pompeo; we worked very closely together, we really liked each other -- which is unusual, by the way, for administrations in politics -- and it's just good to see everyone here in jerusalem,"" he said. earlier in the day at the israeli parliament kushner, trump, netanyahu and others had attended the launch of the abraham accord caucus. the caucus, made up of more than 100 members of parliament, aims to work on measures that expand the abraham accords. and while the evening's festivities appeared to be a toast to the trump administration, the knesset event had the feel of a netanyahu campaign rally. almost every time the former israeli pm's name was mentioned, parts of the audience broke out into applause. the same could not be said whenever biden or bennett's names came up. when netanyahu arrived -- halfway through the event -- with wife sara in tow, about a quarter of the audience gave a standing ovation, despite the fact that morocco's ambassador to israel was mid-speech at the time. during his own address netanyahu feted himself, quoting passages from his book and old speeches that he said perfectly laid out how peace with arab nations could be achieved. hailing the work carried out by the trump administration to get such deals done, netanyahu said he believed he and kushner, along with the rest of trump's team, had ""changed history."" just a few hours later netanyahu, who appears to have taken a page out of the former president's playbook on how to treat your successor, lambasted bennett from the knesset stage, saying he was ""not a real prime minister."" for both netanyahu and the trump crew, this was a day spent relishing past glories, looking back to what had been and forward -- perhaps -- to what might come again.

"'Isolated' but defiant, Brazil's Bolsonaro defends handling of Covid and climate at UN",2021-09-21,99.0,"with covid-19 and the environment at the top of the agenda at this year's united nations' general assembly, observers braced for the first world leader to speak in the un headquarters' storied hall: brazil's jair bolsonaro, notorious for both his off-the-cuff comments and controversial handling of the pandemic and the environment. the brazilian president's speech was calmly given, even monotone at times, opening with a numbing sales pitch of his country to investors that touted developments in sanitation and transportation services. he was presenting ""a new brazil whose credibility has been recovered in the world"" -- one very different from the country devastated by the coronavirus on his watch and lashed by fires in the amazon, where bolsonaro has pushed for development. the conservative populist leader stuck to established provocations on social and pandemic issues, repeatedly alluding to the importance of ""the traditional nuclear family"" and criticizing pandemic lockdown measures. doctors should be free to prescribe the use of ""off-label"" medications against covid-19, added the president, who has long championed the unproven malaria medicine hydroxychloroquine as a treatment. brazil traditionally goes first in the general assembly's weeklong roster of speeches by member states, and bolsonaro, who is up for reelection next year, had already set a pugnacious tone for his appearance, publicly flouting the un's ""honor system"" that calls for foreign delegations to be vaccinated before entering the building. bolsonaro declared last week that he would not get vaccinated, because he already had covid-19. ""why do you take a vaccine? to have antibodies, right? my antibodies rate is really high. i can show you the document,"" he said in a live social media broadcast. he added that he will only make a decision about getting vaccinated ""after everyone in brazil gets the vaccine"" -- a dissonant voice as the general assembly pushes this year to increase vaccination throughout the globe, and cajoling wealthier nations to share more doses with poorer ones. but while the brazilian president has tended to use appearances at the un to reject foreign authority -- showing a similar allergy to being told what to do when it comes to another globe-spanning crisis: global warming -- he seemed to sidestep any direct confrontation on that front. in 2020 at the unga podium, as flames raged in the amazon, he told the hand-wringing world to back off, claiming foreign agents were overhyping the wildfires in ""the most brutal misinformation campaign."" he has long painted the environmental concerns expressed by foreign governments, local indigenous groups, and organizations as prelude to an imagined foreign invasion of the amazon. this year, a quieter bolsonaro acknowledged ""environmental challenges"" but boasted that the amazon region had seen a drop of 32% deforestation in august compared to the prior year, citing numbers from the brazilian national institute for space research indicating 918 square kilometers of deforestation. the number is still nearly double what was registered in august 2018, before the bolsonaro administration, however. in contrast, data from the amazon institute of man and environment (imazon) -- which monitors the deforested areas by satellite -- suggest 1,606 square kilometers of deforestation in august, a 7% rise in comparison to the same month last year. it is also the highest rate for august in a decade, according to imazon´s satellites imagery. the president also called on other countries to do their part by fulfilling commitments to climate funding ""at substantial amounts."" his own government has previously received significant foreign aid from other countries to help halt deforestation -- a tactic that some environmental advocates in brazil criticize, pointing out that not all the money allocated for environmental work in brazil is spent in the first place. bolsonaro, never a fan of pandemic restrictions, acknowledged as much in tuesday's speech before world leaders, saying that while he regrets ""all of the deaths that took place in brazil and worldwide,"" the toll of unemployment must be balanced against that of the coronavirus. over the past year, he had frequently raged against municipal and state-level lockdown orders in brazil, even during the grimmest moments of the pandemic, when hospitals filled to capacity and whole cities ran out of oxygen. over half a million brazilians have died in the pandemic -- the highest death toll in the world after the united states. a more moderate tone had been expected from bolsonaro this year, said brian winter, editor-in-chief of americas quarterly and vice president for policy at americas society/council of the americas. for one thing, the assembly's mood was simply different, with fewer fellow right-wing populist leaders to join bolsonaro in giving international busybodies the middle finger. ""bolsonaro is more isolated than ever,"" winter told cnn. ""trump left, netanyahu is gone. the main country that really aligns with his brand of right-wing conservatism is victor orban's hungary,"" he says. (bolsonaro did have a sit-down scheduled with poland's conservative, anti-lgbtq president andrzej duda before he took the stage tuesday, though.) this year, too, the stakes of climate change have never been clearer, with catastrophic fires and floods seen around the world. brazil's vast forest works as an ""air conditioner"" for the globe, influencing global temperature and rainfall patterns, and absorbing carbon dioxide, and winters says bolsonaro had already previewed a new ""constructive"" tone on coordinating climate protection during a summit convened by us president joe biden this spring, when bolsonaro presented a plan to eliminate illegal deforestation by 2030 and neutralize greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. in a meeting monday with uk prime minister boris johnson, bolsonaro showed the same mild-mannered stubbornness that he later displayed at the podium. the two leaders discussed climate and covid-19, and bolsonaro ""affirmed brazil's commitment to sustainable development,"" a brazilian foreign ministry statement read after the meeting. but when it came to getting vaccinated per the united nations' request, he was as unmoving as ever. during footage of the meeting at the un headquarters, johnson could be heard telling bolsonaro, ""astrazeneca, it's a great vaccine. get the astrazeneca vaccine. i had it twice."" bolsonaro laughed the tip off.
